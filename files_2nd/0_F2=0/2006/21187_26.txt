3 Subsidiaries a Acquisitions i Ark Life Assurance Company Limited On 27 January 2006, Hibernian Life Holdings Limited HLH, the parent company of Hibernian Life & Pensions Limited, acquired all the shares of Ark Life Assurance Company Limited Ark Life from Allied Irish Banks plc AIB in exchange for a 24.99% stake in the enlarged HLH and a balancing cash payment of a196 million 134 million which also reflects the transfer of the management of Ark Life funds to Hibernian Investment Managers Limited, part of the Groups fund management business.
The final consideration has not yet been agreed with AIB but is expected to be finalised in 2007.
However, any adjustment to the above figures is not expected to be material.
In addition, a further deferred cash payment of up to a10 million 7 million is payable, subject to the fulfilment of certain performance criteria.
The results of Ark Life have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group with effect from 27 January 2006, and contributed 40 million to the consolidated profit before tax.
The transaction has been accounted for as the acquisition of 75.01% of Ark Life and the disposal of 24.99% of HLH.
The realised gain on disposal of the Groups 24.99% interest in HLH was 86 million.
The Ark Life acquisition has given rise to goodwill on acquisition of 57 million, calculated as follows: Purchase cost: m Fair value of shares in Hibernian Life Holdings Limited 184 Cash paid 134 Attributable costs 4 Total consideration 322 The assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: Fair value and accounting Book value policy Fair value m m m Assets Acquired value of in-force business on insurance and investment contracts 168 168 Other intangible assets 1 44 45 Investments 2,939 74 2,865 Other assets 1,225 15 1,210 Total assets 4,165 123 4,288 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 1,767 22 1,789 Gross liability for investment contracts 2,066 25 2,091 Other liabilities 154 96 58 Total liabilities 3,987 49 3,938 Total net assets 178 172 350 Net assets acquired Group share 265 Goodwill arising on acquisition 57 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 121 3 Subsidiaries continued The value of the agreement to distribute through AIBs networks has been identified as a separate intangible asset and valued by an independent third party at 45 million, using estimated post-tax cash flows and discount rates.
It has been assessed as having a life of 25 years and is being amortised over that period, with a corresponding release of the applicable deferred tax provision.
The residual goodwill of 57 million represents future synergies expected to arise in the combined life operations.
As disclosed in the supplementary information on page 231, the embedded value of the long-term business acquired was 310 million, representing the net assets adjusted for other intangible assets net of tax.
ii Eagle Insurance Company Limited On 1 February 2006, the Group acquired a 51% interest in Eagle Insurance Limited Eagle, the third-largest insurer in Sri Lanka, by buying a majority shareholding in Eagles immediate holding company, NDB Finance Lanka Pvt Limited.
At the same time, Eagle entered into a ten year bancassurance agreement with National Development Bank Limited NDB, Sri Lankas biggest development bank and Eagles other major shareholder.
The cash consideration, including purchase costs, was 15 million.
The fair value of the Groups share of net assets acquired was 12 million, including intangibles of 2 million, giving rise to 3 million of goodwill on acquisition.
As disclosed in the supplementary information on page 231, the embedded value of the long-term business acquired was 17 million, representing the net assets adjusted for other intangible assets net of tax.
iii Canadian brokers On 28 April 2006, the Group acquired a 20% holding in Dale-Parizeau L. M. Inc, a Canadian insurance broker, for a consideration of 16 million which includes purchase costs.
The allocation of the risks and rewards of ownership between the Group and third-party investors in the broker has led the Group to consolidate its results for the period since acquisition to 31 December 2006.
The fair value of the net assets acquired, including intangibles of 10 million, was 9 million, giving rise to 7 million of goodwill on acquisition.
On 4 December 2006, the Group acquired a 20% holding in a second Canadian Insurance broker, Morris & Mackenzie Inc M&M, for a consideration of 28 million including purchase costs.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end, provisional fair values have been used and will be adjusted within 12 months.
The provisional fair value of the net assets acquired, including intangibles of 14 million, was 12 million, giving rise to 16 million of goodwill on acquisition.
On 31 December 2006, the Group completed the disposal of M&Ms non-Quebec based operations for 9 million.
The sale did not give rise to any gain or loss.
Net assets at disposal represented goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax liabilities.
iv AmerUs Group Co On 15 November 2006, the Group acquired 100% of the common stock of AmerUs Group Co. AmerUs for US$69 in cash per common share of AmerUs.
AmerUs is a leading provider of equity-indexed life and annuity products to the United States retirement and savings markets, and the acquisition establishes a leading presence for the Group in these selected high-growth segments.
The total purchase price of US$3.1 billion 1.7 billion represents cash consideration for AmerUs shares and stock options, and stock-based compensation vesting on change of control.
The purchase consideration was partly financed by a 903 million placing of the Companys ordinary shares, with the balance of funding being provided by internal resources and external debt.
The share placing was completed on 13 July 2006, with 129 million shares issued on 18 July, at 7 per share.
The issue of new shares in the Company has attracted merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Of the 903 million above, 32 million has been credited to share capital see note 27 and 871 million has been credited to the merger reserve see note 32 a.
Expenses of 11 million have been charged to the share premium account.
The AmerUs acquisition has given rise to goodwill on acquisition of 669 million, calculated as follows: Purchase cost: m Cash paid 1,669 Attributable costs 11 Total consideration 1,680 Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 122 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Subsidiaries continued The assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: Fair value and accounting Book value policy Fair value m m m Assets Acquired value of in-force business on insurance and investment contracts 179 1,387 1,566 Other intangible assets 126 165 291 Investments 11,539 5 11,544 Other assets 2,717 1,270 1,447 Total assets 14,561 287 14,848 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 11,055 50 11,005 Gross liability for investment contracts 1,137 5 1,142 Other liabilities 1,503 187 1,690 Total liabilities 13,695 142 13,837 Total net assets acquired 866 145 1,011 Goodwill arising on acquisition 669 The largest fair value adjustments above relate to the recognition of a value for the in-force business on insurance and investment contracts acquired by the Group the AVIF and to a reduction in Other assets.
The AVIF adjustment of 1,387 million represents the excess of the value of the acquired in-force life insurance contracts over their IFRS net asset value, and is calculated as the difference between the acquired net tangible assets on a European Embedded EEV value basis and the same net assets on an IFRS basis.
Deferred acquisition costs DAC totalling 1,297 million, included in Other assets in the book value column above, are not recognised in the IFRS fair value balance sheet as they have no fair value at acquisition.
As DAC is reflected in the calculation of AVIF, its write-off in fair value adjustments is offset by the recognition of a fair value in AVIF.
Other intangible assets of 291 million are represented by AmerUs distribution channels and have been valued by an independent thirdparty, using estimated post-tax cash flows and discount rates.
The distribution channels have been assessed as having a life of between six and nine years and their value is being amortised over that period, with a corresponding release of the applicable deferred tax provision.
The residual goodwill of 669 million represents future synergies expected to arise in the combined life operations, the value of new business from new distribution channels and customers going forward, and the value of the workforce and management, related know-how and other future business value not included in the intangibles and the AVIF.
As disclosed in the supplementary information on page 231, the embedded value of the long-term business acquired was 1,107 million, representing the net assets acquired, adjusted for other intangible assets net of tax and corporate debt.
v Material acquisitions summary m Total net assets 1,405 Less: Minority interests 96 Net assets acquired 1,309 Goodwill arising on acquisition 752 Total consideration 2,061 The total consideration comprised: Cash paid 1,862 Fair value of shares 184 Attributable costs 15 2,061 vi Other In addition to the goodwill arising on the above acquisitions, the Group also made a number of smaller acquisitions giving rise to additional goodwill of 9 million.
Total goodwill arising in the year was 761 million see note 15a.
On 1 January 2006, following the introduction of a new Health Insurance Act, a Netherlands subsidiary acquired 100% of the share capital of O. W. M. Delta Lloyd and OHRA Zorgverzekeringen U.
Assets and liabilities acquired amounted to 272 million and 258 million respectively giving rise to 14 million of negative goodwill which has been recognised in the income statement.

The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the combined results that would have been attained had the acquisitions taken place at 1 January 2006, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.
2006 m Revenues net earned premiums and fee income 30,670 Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 3,076 Of the above pre-tax profit, 83 million has arisen since acquisition.
No adjustments have been made to the profit figure above for any additional borrowing costs, integration costs or other synergies that might arise had the acquisitions been completed at 1 January 2006. viii Non-adjusting post-balance sheet events On 1 January 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of the Eurolloyd companies Eurolloyd Nederland BV and Eurolloyd Belgie NV for cash of 11 million.
In view of the very recent timing and immaterial nature of this transaction, it is currently impractical to comply with the requirements of paragraph 67 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and to state with any certainty the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, and therefore to estimate the goodwill arising on this acquisition.
In addition to the above transaction, subsequent to year end, the Group has announced that it will acquire two of the units of Bumiputra-Commerce Holdings Berhad BCHB 49% of each of a Life and a Takaful business - for approximately 75 million.
This transaction is subject to signature and regulatory approval but completion is expected to occur by the second quarter of 2007.
On 8 February 2007, the Group announced that it planned to acquire 100% of the shares in Erasmus Groep BV in the Netherlands.
Erasmus writes both general insurance and long-term business and, at 31 December 2005, had gross assets of 648 million and net assets of 29 million.
The acquisition, when completed, will be effective from 1 January 2007, subject to the approval of the Dutch regulator, the relevant works council and notification to the relevant competition authorities.

Sale of RAC non-core businesses During 2006, the Group completed the disposal of the Manufacturer Support Services MSS and Lex Vehicle Leasing LVL divisions, which had been acquired with the RAC Group in 2005.
The decision to sell was part of the Groups wider strategy to integrate RAC and exit non-core operations.
2006 m Proceeds from sale 358 Net assets disposed of 310 Transaction costs 15 Profit before tax and pension curtailment gain 33 Pension curtailment gain 36 Profit on disposal before tax 69 Tax attributable to profit on disposal 11 Profit on disposal after tax 58 Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 124 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Subsidiaries continued The net assets disposed of, which total 310 million, comprised investment in joint ventures of 239 million, tangible assets of 102 million, other assets of 95 million and other liabilities of 126 million.
The pension curtailment gain arose from the remeasurement of pension liabilities in the RAC plc defined benefit pension scheme, following the MSS and LVL disposals.
i Sale of MSS The MSS disposal was completed in three stages during the first six months of 2006, following the disposals of certain operational assets and liabilities of Hyundai Cars UK and the commercial fleet business of Lex Transfleet in 2005.
On 10 January 2006, the Group sold Hyundai Car Finance Limited, which provides vehicle instalment finance and leasing, to Lloyds TSB.
On 14 February 2006, the Group sold Lex Autologistics Limited, Lex Commercials Limited and associated properties to Imperial Holdings.
On 27 April 2006, the Group completed the sale of the remaining vehicle solutions businesses, comprising Lex Transfleet Limited, Lex Defence Limited, Lex Defence Management Limited and RAC Software Solutions Limited, to VT Group plc.
Receipts from the completion of the disposal of the MSS division totalled 111 million, resulting in a profit of 12 million before tax.
In 2005, the Group sold certain operational assets and liabilities of Hyundai Cars UK and the commercial fleet business of Lex Transfleet for total consideration of 139 million.
The sale resulted in a profit of 5 million, which is included in the 2005 figures above.
Of the total consideration of 250 million received for MSS disposals in 2005 and 2006, 73 million was in respect of retained liabilities to be settled by the Group.
ii Sale of LVL On 31 May 2006, the sale of Avivas 50% stake in Lex Vehicle Leasing Holdings Limited to HBOS plc was completed.
Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, the change of control of RAC provided HBOS with the right to acquire Avivas interest in LVL which HBOS chose to exercise.
The proceeds consisted of a net cash receipt of 227 million, from which Avivas estimated contribution of 16 million to the statutory debt funding of the RAC plc defined benefit pension scheme had been deducted.
The gross consideration was therefore 243 million.
In additional to the disposal of the investment in the joint venture of 239 million, HBOS will make an equivalent contribution to the statutory debt funding of the defined benefit pension scheme, estimated at 16 million.
The sale resulted in a profit of 18 million before tax.
A further 3 million profit arose on the sale of the Lex brand.
No other disposal is considered material for further disclosure.
c Integration and restructuring costs 246 million of integration and restructuring costs have been included in the results for 2006.
21 million related to the restructuring of the combined Norwich Union Insurance and RAC businesses and this completes the integration spend on the RAC businesses.
8 million relates to the integration of Ark Life into the Hibernian business and 12 million to the integration of AmerUs into the US business.
The remaining 205 million relates to Norwich Unions restructuring to reduce duplication and improve efficiency.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 125 3 Subsidiaries continued e Other information Principal subsidiaries at 31 December 2006 are listed on pages 244 to 245.
One of the Groups wholly-owned subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd NV, is subject to the provisions of Dutch corporate law and particularly the Dutch structure company regime.
Under this regime, Delta Lloyd operates under a Supervisory Board which has a duty to have regard to the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders.
The Supervisory Board includes two Aviva Group representatives and is responsible for advising and supervising Delta Lloyds Executive Board.
The shareholder is one of the most important stakeholders to whom the Supervisory Board has a duty.
Dutch Law changed in October 2004 to ensure that Supervisory Board directors in Dutch companies were henceforth to be elected by a companys shareholders voting on nominations made by its Supervisory Board and the Works Council.
Under the previous system, Supervisory Board directors appointed their own successors.
In 2006, Delta Lloyd commenced proceedings against Aviva plc to try to compel the Company to adhere to the system that existed prior to the change in the law, on the basis of agreements they say were entered into in 1973 when the Group acquired Delta Lloyd.
The Company disputes these claims and does not expect the litigation, whatever its outcome, to have any adverse effect on the financial or operational performance of Delta Lloyd or the Group.

b Secondary reporting format geographical segments i Reporting segments Although the Groups business segments are managed on a worldwide basis, they operate in six main geographical areas.
These are United Kingdom UK, France, Netherlands including Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg, Other Europe, United States and Rest of the World.
At a country level, certain classifications in 2005 have changed.
Germany has been reclassified from Other Europe to the Netherlands, Lithuania has been reclassified from Other Europe to Poland, and Norwich Unions Dublin-based offshore life and savings business has been reclassified from Other Europe to the UK.
Revenue by destination does not differ materially from revenue by geographical origin, as most risks are located in the countries where the contracts were written.

This includes both insurance and investment contracts as defined under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and is consistent with the definition of covered business used for our supplementary embedded value reporting.
An analysis of new long-term business sales is provided below.
In this table, single premiums are those relating to products issued by the Group which provide for the payment of one premium only.
Regular premiums are those where there is a contractual obligation to pay on an ongoing basis.
Life and pensions total income represents all net written premiums in the year for insurance contracts and investment contracts, excluding non-participating investment contracts which are required to be accounted for under IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and IAS 18, Revenue.
Under IFRS, the premiums on these contracts are not included in the Group income statement under earned premiums, but are included on the balance sheet as a deposit.
Sales from the Navigator funds administration business, previously excluded from investment sales figures, are now included in the new single premiums figures above.
This change has increased total investment sales for 2006 by 1,371 million 2005: 938 million.

8 Longer term investment return a The longer term investment return, net of expenses, attributable to the general insurance and health business result was 1,073 million 2005: 1,046 million.
b The longer term investment return and short-term fluctuation are as follows: General insurance and health business 2006 2005 m m Net investment income note 4a ii 1,299 1,603 Less: Internal charges included under other headings 77 40 1,222 1,563 Longer term investment return 1,073 1,046 Short-term fluctuation in investment return 149 517 1,222 1,563 c The longer term investment return is calculated separately for each principal general insurance and health business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer term rate of investment return.
The longer term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
d The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the longer term investment return are: Longer term rates of return Longer term rates of return Equities Properties 2006 2005 2006 2005 % % %% United Kingdom 7.1 7.6 6.1 6.6 France 6.3 6.7 5.3 5.7 Ireland 6.3 6.7 5.3 5.7 Netherlands 6.3 6.7 5.3 5.7 Canada 7.0 7.4 6.0 6.4 The Group has applied the same economic assumptions for equities and properties as are used under EEV principles to calculate the longer term investment return for its general insurance and health business.

The tests led to impairment of goodwill of 94 million.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been tested for impairment in these businesses as follows: UK general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the UK general insurance and health unit has also been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 10.45% 2005: 10.45%.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 3% growth rate 2005: 3%.
The recoverable amount significantly exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the UK general insurance industry.
Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, premium rate changes, claims inflation and commission rates.
Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period and has been based upon latest information available regarding future and past growth rates.
The growth rate is considered to be consistent with both past experience and external sources of data ABI Annual Market Statistics.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 143 15 Goodwill continued RAC non-insurance operations The recoverable amount of the RAC non-insurance operations has also been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 10.27% 2005: 10.45%.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2% growth rate.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth.
Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, fee income and customer numbers.
Spain long-term business The recoverable amount of the Spanish unit has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation.
This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amount significantly exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill and a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business.
The underlying methodology and assumptions have been reviewed by a firm of actuarial consultants and by the Groups auditors: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is based on business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements best estimate of future growth.
The rate is in line with industry expectations: and Risk adjusted discount rate represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from that assumed.
United States long-term business The carrying value of the Groups cash-generating unit in the United States is principally represented by the former operations of AmerUs Group Co. AmerUs, which was acquired by the Group on 15 November 2006.
The units current business plan is consistent with the assumptions made at the time of the acquisition in determining the appraisal value of AmerUs, which was in excess of its current carrying value.
Since the acquisition date, the assets and liabilities making up the unit have not changed significantly, and there have been no other events which might have materially affected the recoverable amount of the unit.
Other During the year, goodwill allocated to a long-term business cash-generating unit in Germany, Berlinische, was tested for impairment.
Following the impairment test, an impairment charge of 94 million has been recognised in the income statement.
The impairment charge arose as a result of the fall off in contribution from new business in 2006 and current adverse experience within the in-force portfolio.

They are interest-bearing and are repayable on termination of the relevant partnership.
b Property management undertakings i As part of their investment strategy, the UK and certain European long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships PLPs, either directly or via property unit trusts PUTs, through a mix of capital and loans.
The PLPs are managed by general partners GPs, in which the long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs.
The PUTs are managed by a Group subsidiary.
Most of the PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios.
The lenders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both interest and principal, to the extent that there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any company in the Aviva Group.
Accounting for the PUTs and PLPs as subsidiaries, joint ventures or other financial investments depends on the shareholdings in the GPs and the terms of each partnership agreement.
Where the Group exerts control over a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated.
Where the partnership is managed by a contractual agreement such that no party exerts control, notwithstanding that the Groups partnership share in the PLP including its indirect take via the relevant PUT and GP may be greater than 50%, such PUTs and PLPs have been classified as jointly-controlled entities.
These are accounted for as joint ventures, and are covered in this note.
Where the Group holds minority stakes in PLPs, with no disproportionate influence, the relevant investments are included in financial investments at their fair value.

d Impairment testing The Groups investments in RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a five year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 6.8%.
Cash flows beyond that five year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 4.5%.
The recoverable amounts significantly exceed the carrying values of both the investments and a reasonably possible change to the key underlying assumptions will not cause the carrying values of the investments to exceed their recoverable amounts.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 151 22 Securitised mortgages and related assets The Group has loans secured by mortgages, subject to non-recourse finance arrangements, in a UK long-term business subsidiary and in three Dutch subsidiaries.
Details of the relevant transactions are as follows: a UK In a long-term business subsidiary NUER, the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies, Equity Release Funding No 1 plc ERF1, Equity Release Funding No 2 plc ERF2, Equity Release Funding No 3 plc ERF3, ERF Trustee No 4 Limited ERF4T held on trust for the benefit of Equity Release Funding No.
4 plc ERF4, and ERF Trustee No 5 Limited ERF5T held on trust for the benefit of Equity Release Funding No.
5 plc ERF5 together the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the noteholders, loan providers and other third-parties in the priority of payments.
No gain or loss was recognised on the transfers to ERF1, ERF3 and ERF5T, and gains of 5 million and 9 million were recognised on the transfers to ERF2 and ERF4T respectively.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed rate, floating rate and index-linked notes by the ERF companies.
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust.
Although NUER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, these have been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
NUER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where NUER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
NUER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies.
These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated balance sheet.
b Netherlands and Belgium In three subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering NV DLL, Amstelhuys NV AMS, and Delta Lloyd Bank NV SA DLB, the principal benefits of certain portfolios of mortgage loans have been transferred to a number of special purpose securitisation companies, Arena 2000 I BV, Arena 2001 I BV, Arena 2002 I BV, Arena 2003 I BV, Arena 2004 I BV, Arena 2004 II BV, Arena 2005 I BV, Arena 2006 I BV, B-Arena NV SA and DARTS Finance BV the securitisation companies, which were funded primarily through the issue of fixed rate, floating rate and index-linked notes.
No gains or losses were recognised on these transfers.
All the shares in the securitisation companies are held by independent trustee companies.
Although DLL and AMS do not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the securitisation companies or their parent companies, these companies have been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
DLL, AMS and DLB have no right, nor any obligation, to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans before the optional call date, other than in certain circumstances where they are in breach of warranty.
Delta Lloyd companies have purchased notes in the securitisation companies, which have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the securitisation companies in the consolidated balance sheet.
c In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that noteholders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that noteholders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by Norwich Union Life & Pensions and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the Netherlands, the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders and after tax, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits that are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In the United States, there are two main business segments - protection products and accumulation products.
Protection products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies.
The accumulation product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business customers.
In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary companies.
All products are classified as insurance contracts except for the funding agreements and term certain immediate annuities, which are classified as nonparticipating investment contracts.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 164 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Insurance liabilities continued ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where there is discretion over these.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
The principal assumptions in the UK, France, the Netherlands and the United States are: a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, the retrospective approach is not available or is inappropriate, so a prospective valuation approach is used instead, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Smoothing which can be negative : Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
In the Provident Mutual and with-profit funds in NUL&P, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
Where policyholders have valuable guarantees, options or promises, then future persistency is assumed to improve, and future take-up rates of guaranteed annuity options are assumed to increase.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 165 35 Insurance liabilities continued The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on gilts, plus a margin of 0.1% is used.
The rates vary, according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at year end 2006 being 4.84% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return The volatility of returns is assumed to be distributed as follows: Financial investment Volatility Equities 17% for UK stocks Property 15% Gilts 3.25% NUL&P WP 4.5% other WP funds Corporate bonds 5.25% NUL&P WP 6.5% other WP funds Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2007 have been set consistently with the year end 2006 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent company experience and general industry trends.
Mortality table used 2006 2005 Assurances, pure endowments and Nil or AM92 AF92 Nil or AM92 AF92 deferred annuities before vesting or AM80 AF80 adjusted Pensions business after vesting and PCMA00 PCFA00 PCMA00 PCFA00 or PMA92 pensions annuities in payment adjusted plus allowance PFA92 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality for future mortality improvement improvement Non-profit business Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Changes have been made to the assumptions for certain non-profit business during 2006, resulting from a decision taken by management to adopt changes permitted by the FSA Policy Statement 06 14, Prudential Changes for Insurers, issued in December 2006.
These are as follows: For certain blocks of protection business, the reserve for some policies may now be negative, where previously it would have been set to zero.
Prudent lapse assumptions have been introduced for these blocks of protection business.
Prudent assumptions will be lower than expected for policies with positive reserves and higher than expected for policies with negative reserves.
For certain blocks of unit-linked business, lower levels of expenses are allowed for in the calculation of individual policy reserves, with the remaining expenses being covered by future valuation margins on the overall block of similar policies.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 166 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Insurance liabilities continued The changes in the valuation discount rates since 2005 reflect the changes in the yields on the supporting assets.

Since 2005, there have been changes to both assurance and annuity mortality bases, although the same standard mortality tables are still used.
The assurance mortality basis is unchanged from 2005 for most blocks of business, though has been weakened for certain blocks of business where experience reviews have indicated that this is appropriate.

The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.

A liability adequacy test is performed in line with IFRS requirements.
Where liabilities are based on current market interest rates and assets are valued at market value, the margin in the liability adequacy test is determined by comparison of the liabilities with the present value of best estimate cash flows.

The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values.
Reserve interest assumptions range from 2.00% to 7.50%.
The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2006 was 4.48%.
Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, indexed life, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.
The weighted average interest crediting rates for universal life products were 4.37% in 2006.
The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 2.75% to 7.00% in 2006.
An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally-weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality.
The additional liability represents the present value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions.
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain indices.
A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum guaranteed value.
A further portion of the premium is used to purchase call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices.
Both the call options and the options embedded in the policy are valued at their fair value.
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years.
The excess charges are deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs.
Shadow adjustments may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities.
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in equity so that unrealised gains or losses on investments that are recognised directly in equity affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same way as realised gains or losses.
e In all other countries, local generally-accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.

c General insurance and health liabilities Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The reserves for general insurance and health are based on information currently available: however, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Country Class 2006 2005 2006 2005 Netherlands Permanent health and injury 3.61% 3.21% 9 years 7 years The net outstanding claims provisions before discounting were 12,768 million 2005: 13,014 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians, applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios.
Instead, the assumptions used are those implicit in the historic claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.

d Loss development tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2001 to 2006.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2002, by the end of 2006 5,466 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,250 million was re-estimated to be 6,205 million at 31 December 2006.
This decrease from the original estimate is due to the combination of a number of factors.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
In 2005, the year of adoption of IFRS, only five years were required to be disclosed.
This is being increased in each succeeding additional year, until ten years of information is included.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its non-life and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will then result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables.
However, in order to maintain strong reserves, the Group transfers much of this release to current accident year 2006 reserves where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
The release from prior accident year reserves during 2006 is also due to an improvement in the estimated ultimate cost of claims.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 171 35 Insurance liabilities continued The loss development tables include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2001.
The claims provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business were 312 million 2005: 289 million.
The movement in the year reflects strengthening of the provisions by 9 million 2005: 83 million and timing differences between claim payments and reinsurance recoveries.

Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 35.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 38.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Most non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
For this business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 25 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 45.
In the United States, funding agreements consist of one to ten year fixed rate contracts.
These contracts may not be cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may be terminated by Aviva at any time.
The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate funding agreements in 2006 were 5.07% and 5.55%, respectively.
The funding agreements are measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 175 38 Financial guarantees and options As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 35 and 37. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
In addition, while these do not constitute guarantees, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Subject to certain conditions, top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14 Prudential Changes for Insurers, as outlined in note 35 b iii a. i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 39 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 44 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 176 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Financial guarantees and options continued c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2006.
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 21 billion at 31 December 2006 2005: 22 billion.
The guaranteed bonus on this contract equals 65% of the average of the last two years declared bonus rates or 60% of the TME index rates if higher and was 3.30% for 2006 2005: 3.51% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 4.81% 2005: 4.91%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 6 billion 2005: 7 billion at 31 December 2006 and guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5% on 98.3% of liabilities.
For non-AFER business, the accounting income return exceeded guaranteed bonus rates in 2006.
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2006 for this guarantee is 8 million 2005: 14 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2006, total sums at risk for these contracts were 38 million 2005: 73 million out of total unit-linked funds of 13 billion 2005: 8 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 53.
It is estimated that this reserve would increase by 3 million 2005: 1 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 2 million 2005: 0.1 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2006 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Netherlands Guaranteed minimum return at maturity In the Netherlands, it is market practice to guarantee a minimum return at maturity on traditional savings and pension contracts.
Guarantees on older lines of business are 4% per annum while, for business written since 1 September 1999, the guarantee is 3% per annum.
On Group pensions business, it is often possible to recapture guarantee costs through adjustments to surrender values or to premium rates.
On transition to IFRS, Delta Lloyd changed the reserving basis for most traditional contracts to reflect current market interest rates, for consistency with the reporting of assets at market value.
The cost of meeting interest rate guarantees is allowed for directly in the liabilities.
Although most traditional contracts are valued at market interest rate, the split by level of guarantee shown below is according to the original underlying guarantee.
The total liabilities for traditional business at 31 December 2006 are 8 billion 2005: 8 billion analysed as follows: Liabilities 3% Liabilities 3% Liabilities 4% Liabilities 4% guarantee guarantee guarantee guarantee 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m Individual 1,222 1,148 2,989 3,074 Group pensions 518 408 3,180 3,333 Total 1,740 1,556 6,169 6,407 Delta Lloyd has certain unit-linked contracts which provide a guaranteed minimum return at maturity from 4% pa to 2% pa.
Provisions consist of unit values plus an additional reserve for the guarantee.
The additional provision for the guarantee was 76 million 2005: 127 million.
An additional provision of 43 million 2005: 77 million in respect of investment return guarantees on group segregated fund business is held.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 163 million 2005: 293 million if yields were to reduce by 1% pa and by 25 million 2005: 44 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2006 levels.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 177 38 Financial guarantees and options continued iii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 152 million 2005: 145 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is no exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently out-of-the-money by 69 million 2005: 84 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
It is estimated that the guarantees would be out-of-the-money by 74 million 2005: 74 million if yields were to increase by 1% per annum and by 31 million 2005: 39 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2006 levels.
Return of premium guarantee In 2005, Hibernian Life wrote two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee after five or six years.
The provision for these at the end of 2006 is nil 2005: 3 million.
It is expected that the provision would not increase if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2006 levels.
We would not expect any significant impact on this provision as a result of interest movements.
iv Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2006, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 3 billion 2005: 2 billion with a further reserve of 18 million 2005: 20 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 5 billion 2005: 4 billion, with a further provision of 46 million 2005: 55 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 66 million 2005: 66 million in Spain and 9 million 2005: 12 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2006 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.42% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
v United States Indexed and total return strategy products In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products.
These products guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Stock Price Index.
A portion of each premium is used to purchase call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder.
The call options held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2006, the total liabilities for indexed products were 5.4 billion.
If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by 51 million and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by 56 million.
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account.
The Group guarantees a minimum return of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts.
The linked general account assets are fixed maturity securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2006, the liabilities for total return strategy products were 408 million.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 178 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 39 Effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year Certain estimates and assumptions used in determining liabilities for insurance and investment contract business were changed from 2005 to 2006, and had the following effect on the profit recognised for the year with an equivalent effect on liabilities.
This disclosure only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.

This results from the use of higher valuation interest rates on annuities and other business, reflecting the rise in market interest rates over the year.
The mortality impacts relate primarily to assumption changes in the UK and Ireland.
The impact on existing business of implementing FSA Policy Statement 06 14, Prudential Changes for Insurers, in 2006 is 132 million, arising mainly on expenses and persistency rates in both insurance and investment contracts.
This is reflected in reductions in insurance contract liabilities of 800 million see note 35 b, investment contract liabilities of 105 million see note 37 c, reinsurance recoveries of 502 million see note 36 c and deferred acquisition costs of 271 million see note 25 b.
The impact on new business in 2006 is 17 million, giving a total increase in pre-tax profit for the year of 149 million.

These tax losses will expire as follows: 26 million 0-10 years and 26 million 11-20 years 2005: 40 million within 0-10 years and 35 million within 11-20 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has an unrecognised capital loss of 468 million 2005: 446 million.
This tax loss can be offset against future capital gains and has not been recognised in these financial statements.
These capital losses of 29 million will expire within 0-10 years.
The remaining capital losses have no expiry date.
Deferred tax liabilities of 527 million 2005: 347 million have not been established for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates including tax payable on remittance of overseas retained earnings because the Group can control the timing of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 180 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 42 Pension obligations a Introduction The Group operates a large number of pension schemes around the world, whose members receive benefits on either a defined benefit basis generally related to a members final salary and length of service or a defined contribution basis generally related to the amount invested, investment return and annuity rates.
The only material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the main UK scheme is by far the largest.
The assets of the main UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the funds beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
An actuarial report has been submitted for each of the defined benefit schemes within the last three years, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
b Main UK scheme In the UK, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS and the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme.
New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS, as the defined benefit section is closed to new employees.
This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, staff, pensioners and an independent trustee referred to below as the trustees.
i Defined benefit section of the ASPS The Company works closely with the trustees who are required to consult it on the funding of the scheme and its investment strategy.
At 31 March 2005, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over available assets.
The Company is currently discussing with the trustees the period over which it will aim to eliminate the funding deficit and will monitor funding levels on an annual basis.
The employing companies contributions to the defined benefit section of the ASPS throughout 2006 were 35% of employees pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year, and additional deficit funding payments totalling 200 million.
As this section of the scheme is closed to new entrants and the contribution rate is determined using the projected unit credit method, it is expected that the percentage cost of providing future service benefits will continue to increase as the membership ages, leading to higher pension costs, and the number of members falls, leading to a higher charge per member.
The employers contribution rate for 2007 has therefore been increased to 37% of pensionable salaries expected to be 120 million, pending finalisation of the April 2006 valuation.
The Group is also expecting to make further contributions of some 400 million into the ASPS prior to March 2008.
Active members of this section of the ASPS contribute 5% of their pensionable salaries.
In 2005, the Groups UK life business carried out an investigation into the allocation of costs in respect of funding the ASPS, to identify the deficit that arose in respect of accruals prior to the introduction of the current management services agreements MSAs and to propose a split between individual product companies based on an allocation of the deficit into pre-and post-MSA amounts.
The results of this review were updated during 2006 and agreed by the relevant company boards and accepted by the UK regulator.
Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2006, the Companys UK with-profit product companies are liable for a share, currently 12%, of the additional payments for deficit funding referred to above.
This has resulted in a transfer of 130 million from the unallocated divisible surplus UDS to the income statement, to reflect the position at the start of the year, and a movement of 30 million back to the UDS via the statement of recognised income and expense to reflect actuarial movements in the deficit during the year and therefore a change in the amount recoverable from the with-profit product companies.
For funding purposes, the schemes valuation as at 1 April 2006 is currently being completed, with the obligations calculated using the Projected Unit Method which is described below.
ii Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
The employers contribution rates for members of the defined contribution section throughout 2006 were 8% of pensionable salaries, together with further contributions up to 4% where members contribute, and the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2007.

Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.
Excluding the deficit funding in the UK schemes discussed above, total employer contributions for these schemes in 2007 are expected to be 270 million.
i Assumptions on scheme liabilities The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation the present value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases or on a solvency basis, using the cost of buying out benefits at a particular date with a suitable insurer.
However, neither of these is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Groups obligations to the members of its pension schemes on an ongoing basis.
The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2006.
The updating was made by actuaries in each country who, other than the actuary of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme and Dutch arrangements, were independent of the Group.
Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2006.
The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Inflation rate 3.1% 2.8% 1.9% 1.4% 2.5% 2.5% 2.25% 2.0% General salary increases 4.9% 4.6% 2.4% 1.4% 3.75% 3.75% 4.0% 3.75% Pension increases 3.1% 2.8% 1.9% 1.4% 1.25% 1.25% 2.15% 1.9% Deferred pension increases 3.1% 2.8% 1.9% 1.4% 0% 0% 2.15% 1.9% Discount rate 5.1% 4.8% 4.6% 4.0% 5.0% 5.0% 4.7% 4.2% Basis of discount rate AA-rated AA-rated AA-rated AA-rated Eurozone corporate bonds corporate bonds corporate bonds corporate bonds Age-related scale increases plus 2.4% 2005: 1.4%.
The discount rate and inflation rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
A 1% increase in this rate and therefore the net discount rate would reduce the liabilities by 1.7 billion.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 182 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 42 Pension obligations continued Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The mortality tables and average life expectancy used at 31 December 2006 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy Life expectancy at NRA of a male at NRA of a female Normal retirement 20 years 20 years age Currently younger Currently younger Country of scheme Mortality table NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA UK PA92 calendar year 2007 with a one year age rating deduction 60 27.7 28.9 30.6 31.7 and an allowance for future improvements Netherlands Coll 2003 65 17.0 17.0 20.4 20.4 Canada UP1994 projected to 2005, using Scale AA 65 18.2 18.2 21.2 21.2 Ireland PA92c2015 current pensioners 2030 future pensioners 60 23.6 24.8 26.6 27.7 The above tables used to measure post-retirement mortality are considered appropriate based on the mortality experience of the schemes.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are by far the most material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial professions medium cohort projection table.
In the main UK scheme, the effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the schemes liabilities by 200 million.
The scheme liabilities have an average duration of 22 years in the UK schemes and between 14 and 16 years in the overseas schemes.
ii Assumptions on scheme assets The expected rates of return on the schemes assets are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Equities 8.0% 8.0% 6.5% 6.3% 7.8% 8.0% 7.5% 7.5% Bonds 4.75% 4.45% 4.0% 3.6% 4.5% 4.4% 4.1% 3.6% Property 6.0% 5.95% 6.2% 5.3% n a n a 5.5% 5.0% Other 5.3% 4.1% 4.0% 3.6% n a n a n a n a The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations.
The expected returns are developed in conjunction with external advisers and take into account both current market expectations of future returns, where available, and historical returns.
Plan assets in the UK and Dutch schemes include insurance policies with other Group companies.
Where these policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, their expected rates of return are included in the appropriate line in the table above.
iii Pension expense As noted above, plan assets in the UK and Dutch schemes include insurance policies with other Group companies.
To avoid doublecounting of investment income on scheme assets and the assets backing the underlying policies, adjustments have been made to the former in the current year as shown in the tables below.

Plan assets in the table above include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated balance sheet of 336 million 2005: 578 million in the UK scheme, and insurance policies of 152 million and 934 million 2005: 143 million and 732 million in the UK and Dutch schemes respectively.
Where the investment and insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in Other.
The Dutch insurance policies are backed by all the assets in the relevant column above, whilst the UK policies are included in Other.
These insurance policies, totalling 1,086 million 2005: 875 million are considered non-transferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions see note 41.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 185 42 Pension obligations continued Excluding these policies, the total IAS 19 obligations to the schemes are 2,059 million 2005: 2,346 million, as shown in the following table.
To meet these objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities.
These reflect the current long-term asset allocation ranges chosen having regard to the structure of liabilities within the schemes.

In the UK, the value of the liabilities has increased due to a strengthening to the post-retirement mortality assumptions and higher assumed inflation, partially offset by an increase in the corporate bond yields used for the valuation discount rate.
The increase in scheme assets is primarily due to an improvement in equity values since the previous year end, partially offset by a reduction in bond values, together with deficit contribution payments made by the employing companies.

They rank below its senior obligations and ahead of its preference shares and ordinary share capital.
The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes.
The fair value of these notes at 31 December 2006 was 3,076 million 2005: 3,148 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
ii Debenture loans The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of 1.1 million.
This discount and the issue expenses are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary.
The 2.5% perpetual subordinated loan notes were issued by a Dutch subsidiary to finance the acquisition of NUTS OHRA Beheer BV in 1999.
They are convertible into ordinary shares in Delta Lloyd NV, should there be a public offering of those shares.
These loan notes have a face value of a489.9 million but, because they are considered to be perpetual, their carrying value is a172.4 million, calculated in 1999 and based on the future cash flows in perpetuity discounted back at a market rate of interest.
The rate of interest paid on the notes is being gradually increased to a maximum of 2.76% in 2009.
The 5.95% Senior Notes had been issued by a United States subsidiary prior to acquisition by the Group.
These notes may be redeemed at the Groups option at any time, in whole or in part, subject to payment of a redemption premium.
On 23 February 2007, the subsidiary exercised its option to redeem the notes early for an amount not significantly different to their carrying value.
As a result, these notes have been shown in table a as maturing within one year.
Other loans comprise borrowings in the United States and the Netherlands.
Fixed rate borrowings comprise 535 million 2005: 317 million of the total carrying value of 644 million 2005: 334 million.
The fair value of debenture loans at 31 December 2006 was 703 million 2005: 405 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices or discounted future cash flows as appropriate.
iii Bank loans In September 2004, one of the Groups UK long-term business subsidiaries, Norwich Union Life & Pensions Limited NULAP, entered into a securitisation arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc RBSG, to provide funding to cover initial new business acquisition and administration costs.
Under the arrangement, an RBSG company has provided a loan facility of 200 million to NULAP in respect of selected term assurance policies, secured on future premiums and repayment of commissions due from brokers where a policy has lapsed.
The funding is repayable over four years from the date of advance, and interest is charged at a floating rate.
RBSG has no recourse to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
The balance drawn on the facility at 31 December 2006 was 200 million 2005: 191 million.
On 12 January 2007, under a Deed of Release and Termination, this arrangement was cancelled.
As explained in note 17b, the UK long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships PLPs.
The PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios, and the lenders are only entitled to obtain payment of both interest and principal to the extent there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
Loans of 259 million 2005: 156 million included in the tables relate to those PLPs which have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
The fair value of these loans is considered to be the same as their carrying value.
iv Commercial paper The commercial paper consists of 733 million in the Company 2005: 499 million and 4 million in France 2005: 4 million.
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, euros and US dollars.
The fair value of the commercial paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

These loan notes have external credit ratings which have not changed since the inception of the loans.
d Undrawn borrowings The Group has the following undrawn committed central borrowing facilities available to it, of which 1,000 million 2005: 1,000 million is used to support the commercial paper programme: 2006 2005 m m Expiring within one year 1,180 890 Expiring beyond one year 980 1,360 2,160 2,250 44 Payables and other financial liabilities 2006 2005 m m Payables arising out of direct insurance 1,389 1,639 Payables arising out of reinsurance operations 408 618 Deposits received from reinsurers 1,244 883 Loans from associates 3 Bank overdrafts 696 690 Derivative liabilities 355 526 Bank customer accounts 2,008 2,317 Bank deposits received from other banks 1,013 565 Other financial liabilities 2,122 2,340 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 96 9,235 9,485 Expected to be settled within one year 8,200 7,384 Expected to be settled in more than one year 1,035 2,101 9,235 9,485 Bank overdrafts arise substantially from unpresented cheques and amount to 266 million 2005: 115 million in long-term business operations and 430 million 2005: 575 million in general business and other operations.

Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 190 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 45 Other liabilities 2006 2005 mm Deferred income 265 265 Reinsurers share of deferred acquisition costs 221 146 Accruals 1,138 1,096 Other liabilities 2,610 1,862 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 49 4,234 3,320 Expected to be settled within one year 3,468 2,539 Expected to be settled in more than one year 766 781 4,234 3,320 46 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors a Uncertainty over claims provisions Note 35 gives details of the estimation techniques used in determining the general business outstanding claims provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions, which are designed to allow for prudence and the appropriate cost of future policy-related liabilities.
Both are estimated to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed, or future general business claims inflation differs from that expected, there is uncertainty in respect of this liability.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including the UK, Australia and Canada.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, the Groups net exposure to such liabilities is not significant and, on the basis of current information and having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products Note 38 gives details of guarantees and options given by various Group companies as a normal part of their operating activities, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
In the UK, in common with other pension and life policy providers, the Group wrote individual and group pension policies in the 1970s and 1980s with a guaranteed annuity rate option GAO.
Since 1993, such policies have become more valuable to policyholders, and more costly for insurers, as current annuity rates have fallen in line with interest rates and improving longevity.
Reserving policies for the cost of GAOs varied until a ruling by the House of Lords in the Equitable Life case in 2000 which effectively required full reserving by all companies.
Prior to the ruling, consistent with the Groups ordinary reserving practice in respect of such obligations, full reserves for GAOs had already been established.
No adjustment was made, or was necessary, to the Groups reserving practice as a result of the ruling.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions are sufficient.
d Pensions mis-selling The pensions review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA, has largely been completed.
A provision of some 31 million 2005: 42 million remains to meet the outstanding costs of the very few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
e Endowment reviews In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.
A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least as well as they would have done without an endowment.
Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Groups UK mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specific letters advising them whether their investment was on track to cover their mortgage.
In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity.
The Group will send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment holders, in accordance with FSA requirements.
The Group has made provisions totalling 128 million 2005: 195 million to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups liability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 191 46 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued In August 2004, the Group confirmed its intention to introduce time barring on mortgage endowment complaints, under FSA rules.
The Group now includes details of its endowment policyholders time bar position within the annual reprojection mailings.
Customers will be given at least 12 months individual notice before a time bar becomes applicable double the six months notice required by the FSA.
f Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened litigation arising therefrom.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain other Group companies.
The total exposure of the Group and Company is 7 million 2005: 7 million and 109 million 2005: 109 million respectively but, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have been given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.

The capital statement also provides a reconciliation of shareholders funds to regulatory capital.
The analysis below sets out the Groups available capital resources.
Other sources of capital include Subordinated debt of 2,937 million issued by Aviva and 153 million of other qualifying capital issued by Dutch, Italian and US subsidiary undertakings.
Including an adjustment for minorities.
Includes the Provident Mutual with-profit fund.
Other operations include general insurance and fund management business.
The regulatory and valuation admissibility restrictions for 2005 have been changed following a revised application of the technical rules.
This has increased total capital resources by 4.4 billion, all attributable to life operations.

The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
For the UK with-profit funds, the increase in available capital has been driven by the favourable economic environment.
Equity performance was positive, which had a direct effect on the equity content of the estate assets and an indirect impact from the reduction in maturity guarantee costs.
Fixed interest yields have generally increased.
Although this has led to capital depreciation of fixed interest assets it also resulted in a reduction of guarantee costs, with the increase in yield having a net benefit to the estates of all the funds.
Also, the implied market volatility for equities has reduced, which lowers the assumed future asset share volatility, particularly in CGNU and CULAC, and consequently guarantee costs are reduced.
The changes in management policy relate to the review of bonus rates for with-profit business.
The capital position of the Other UK life operations was augmented by changes to reserving for UK non-profit business permitted under the FSA Policy Statement PS06 14 Prudential Changes for Insurers, as outlined in Note 35 b, which are included in operating assumption changes.
For the Overseas life operations, the negative variance between actual and expected experience is driven mainly by the increase in market interest rates, which has led to capital depreciation of fixed interest assets and consequential reduction of the unallocated divisible surplus in France and other European businesses.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 19.5 billion 2005: 18.0 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year end transfer to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds available capital of 6.9 billion 2005: 5.2 billion can only be used to provide support for UK with-profit business and is not available to cover other shareholder risks.
This is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin and, therefore, the shareholders are not required to provide further capital support to this business.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 12.6 billion 2005: 12.8 billion is significantly higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
As the total available capital of 19.5 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently, it understates the economic capital of the business which is considerably higher.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 196 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 49 Capital statement continued Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva plc to the NUL&P non-profit fund to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the FSAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.
These realistic liabilities include the shareholders share of future bonuses of 0.7 billion 31 December 2005: 0.7 billion.
Realistic liabilities adjusted to eliminate the shareholders share of future bonuses are 48.6 billion 31 December 2005: 50.5 billion.
These realistic liabilities make provision for guarantees, options and promises on a market consistent stochastic basis.
The value of the provision included within the realistic liabilities is 0.5 billion, 0.7 billion and 3.0 billion for CGNU life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively.
31 December 2005: 0.7 billion, 0.9 billion and 3.4 billion for CGNU life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively.
The risk capital margin RCM is 4.2 times covered by the orphan estate 31 December 2005: 2.7 times.
Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK life with-profits business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU Directives regulatory peak and the FSA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the FSA requirements For overseas businesses in the EEA, US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
All businesses hold sufficient available capital to meet their capital resource requirement.
The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 197 49 Capital statement continued i UK with-profit funds CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P any available surplus held in each fund can only be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself or be distributed to policyholders and shareholders.
With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund in the case of CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
50 Risk management a Risk management framework The Group has established a risk management framework whose primary objective is to protect the Group from events that hinder the sustainable achievement of the Groups performance objectives, including failing to exploit opportunities.
Risk is categorised as follows: Market Credit Insurance Operational Liquidity The Group recognises the critical importance of having efficient and effective risk management systems in place.
To this end, the Group has an established governance framework, which has three key elements: Defined terms of reference for the Board, its committees, and the associated executive management committees: A clear organisational structure with documented delegated authorities and responsibilities from the Board to executive management committees and senior management: and A Group policy framework that sets out risk appetite, risk management, control and business conduct standards for the Groups worldwide operations.
Each policy has a member of senior management who is charged with overseeing compliance with the policy throughout the Group.
Regulatory impact on risk and risk assessments Where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance products where the majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are actively and prudently managed in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
In addition, the Groups worldwide insurance operations are subject to numerous local regulatory requirements that prescribe the type, quality, and concentration of investments, and the level of assets to be maintained in local currency in order to meet local insurance liabilities.
These requirements help to maintain the Groups market risk levels at an acceptable level in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
The adoption of the Groups policies on risk management enables a consistent approach to management of risk at business unit level.
The Group operates a number of oversight committees that monitor aggregate risk data and take overall risk management decisions.
The Group also monitors a set of specific risks on a regular basis through the Group risk monitoring framework.
Businesses units are required to disclose to the Group risk function all material risks, along with information on likelihood and severity of risks, and the mitigating actions taken or planned.
This enables the Group to assess its overall risk exposure and to develop a group-wide risk map, identifying any concentrations of risk that may exist, and to define which risks and what level of risk the Group is prepared to accept.
The risk map is refreshed quarterly, and business units are required to escalate material changes intra-quarter.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 198 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 50 Risk management continued b Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, property prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
The Group has established a policy on market risk which sets out the principles that businesses are expected to adopt in respect of management of the key market risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Group monitors adherence to this market risk policy and regularly reviews how business units are managing these risks locally, through the Group Investment Committee and ultimately to the Asset Liability Management committee.
For each of the major components of market risk, described in more detail below, the Group has put in place additional policies and procedures to set out how each risk should be managed and monitored, and the approach to setting an appropriate risk appetite.
The management of market risk is undertaken in both business units and at Group level.
Business units manage market risks locally using their market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
Business units may also be constrained by the requirement to meet policyholders reasonable expectations and to minimise or avoid market risk in a number of areas.
The Group Investment committee is responsible for managing market risk at Group level, and a number of investment related risks, in particular those faced by the shareholder funds throughout the Group.
The financial impact from changes in market risk such as interest rates, equity prices and property values is examined through stress tests adopted in the Individual Capital Assessments ICA and Financial Condition Reports FCR, which both consider the impact on capital from variations in financial circumstances on either a remote scenario, or to changes from the central operating scenario.
Both consider the management actions that may be taken in mitigation of the change in circumstances.
The sensitivity of Group earnings to changes in economic markets is regularly monitored through sensitivities to investment returns and asset values in EEV reporting.
The Group market risk policy sets out the minimum principles and framework for matching liabilities with appropriate assets, the approaches to be taken when liabilities cannot be matched and the monitoring processes that are required.
The Group has criteria for matching assets and liabilities for all classes of business in order to manage the financial risk from the mismatching of assets and liabilities when investment markets change.
The local regulatory environment for each business will also set the conditions under which assets and liabilities are to be matched.
Equity price risk The Group is subject to equity price risk due to daily changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio.
The Groups shareholders are exposed to both direct equity shareholdings in its shareholder assets, from the indirect impact from changes in the value of equities held in policyholders funds from which management charges or a share of performance are taken, and from its interest in the free estate of long-term funds.
At business unit level, equity price risk is actively managed in order to mitigate anticipated unfavourable market movements where this lies outside the risk appetite of the fund concerned.
In addition local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities.
The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.
Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of stochastic models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates.
The Investment Committee actively monitors equity assets owned directly by the Group, which may include some material shareholdings in the Groups strategic business partners.
Concentrations of specific equity holdings eg the strategic holdings are also monitored monthly by the Capital Management Committee.
A sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section g below.
Property price risk The Group is subject to property price risk due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide.
The investment in property is managed at business unit level, and will be subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders.
At 31 December 2006, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices.
A sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section g below.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 199 50 Risk management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities, which are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include Value-at-Risk analysis, position limits, scenario testing, stress testing and asset and liability matching using measures such as duration.
Interest rate risk also exists in products sold by the group, in particular from policies that carry investment guarantees on early surrender or at maturity, where claim values can become higher than the value of backing assets when interest rates rise or fall.
The Group manages this risk by adopting close asset liability matching criteria, to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and liabilities from interest rate movements.
However where any mismatch is within our risk appetite, the impact is monitored through economic capital measures such as ICA.
On short-term business such as general insurance business the Group requires a close matching of assets and liabilities by duration to minimise this risk.
The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is regularly monitored.
Interest rate risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options and swaps, caps and floors, in order to provide a degree of hedging against unfavourable market movements in interest rates inherent in the assets backing technical liabilities.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into a number of interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effects of potential adverse interest rate movements, and to enable close matching of assets and liabilities.
A sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section g below.
Further information on borrowings is included in note 43.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies.
Approximately half of the Groups premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Groups net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling, and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
The Groups foreign exchange policy requires that each of the Groups subsidiaries maintain sufficient assets in their local currencies to meet local currency liabilities.
Therefore, capital held by the Groups business units should be able to support local business activities regardless of foreign currency movements.
However, such movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to manage these exposures by aligning the deployment of capital by currency, with the Groups regulatory capital requirements by currency.
Limits are set to control the extent to which the deployment of capital is not aligned fully with the Groups capital requirement for each major currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.

A 10% change in sterling to euro US$ foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on net assets.
Apart from the impact on financial instruments covered below, the changes arise from retranslation of Business Unit balance sheets from their functional currencies into sterling, with movements being taken through the currency translation reserve.
These movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.

For this reason, no sensitivity analysis is given for these holdings.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 200 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 50 Risk management continued Derivatives risk Derivatives are used by a number of the larger businesses, within policy guidelines agreed by the Board of directors and overseen by a Group derivatives committee, which monitors implementation of the policy, exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions proposed by business units.
Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes or to structure specific retail-savings products.
The Group also manages a number of hedge funds which use derivatives extensively within a defined derivative framework.
Derivative transactions are fully covered by either cash or corresponding assets and liabilities.
Speculative activity is prohibited, unless approval has been obtained from the Derivatives committee.
Over the counter derivative contracts are entered into only with approved counterparties, in accordance with our Group policies, thereby reducing the risk of credit loss.
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.
Correlation risk The Group recognises that identified lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates.
These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the ICA in the aggregation of the financial stress tests with the operational risk assessment.
FCRs also consider scenarios involving a number of correlated events.
A number of policyholder participation features have an influence on the Groups interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 38. c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss in the value of financial assets due to counterparties failing to meet all or part of their obligations.
The Groups management of credit risk includes monitoring exposures at a Group level and requiring business units to implement local credit risk policies.
The local business unit credit risk policies involve the establishment and operation of specific risk management committees and the detailed reporting and monitoring of the financial asset portfolio against pre-established risk criteria.
Large individual counterparty exposures exceeding 25 million are aggregated and monitored at Group level against centrally-set limits reflecting the credit ratings by companies such as Standard & Poors.
In addition, the Group evaluates the concentration of exposures by industry sector and geographic region through the Group Credit committee.
Financial assets are graded according to current credit ratings issued.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as speculative grade.
Credit limits for each counterparty are set based on default probabilities that are in turn based on the rating of the counterparty concerned.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure, for financial assets with external credit ratings, of the Group at 31 December 2006.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 201 50 Risk management continued The long-term businesses and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations, applicable in most markets, limiting investments in individual assets and asset classes.
In cases where the business is particularly exposed to credit risk e. g. in respect of defaults on mortgages or debt matching annuity liabilities this risk is translated into a more conservative discount rate used to value the liabilities, creating a greater capital requirement, and this credit risk is actively managed.
The impact of aggregation of credit risk is monitored as described above.
With the exception of AAA rated Governments the largest aggregated counterparty exposure does not exceed 1.6% of the Groups total financial assets.
Reinsurance credit exposures The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers, due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures and the impact from reinsurer default is measured regularly, in particular through the ICA tests, and is managed accordingly.
Both the Credit committee and Reinsurance Security committee have a monitoring role over this risk.
The Groups largest reinsurance counterparty is National Indemnity Corporation, a member of the Berkshire Hathaway Group.
At 31 December 2006 the reinsurance asset recoverable from National Indemnity Corporation was 1.3 billion.
This exposure is monitored on a regular basis with the forecast to completion monitored for any shortfall in the claims history to verify that the contract is progressing as expected and that no further exposure for the Group will arise.
In the event of a catastrophic event, the counterparty exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 1.0% of shareholders equity.
The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets that have been impaired and the ageing of financial assets that are past due but not impaired.

This predominantly consists of commercial properties.
The credit ratings table above analyses the credit quality of the above balances where a credit rating is available.
The credit quality of receivables and other financial assets is managed at the local business unit level with uncollectible amounts being impaired when necessary.
There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 202 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 50 Risk management continued d Insurance risk i Life insurance risk Type of risk Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality and morbidity insurance and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels and management and administration expenses.
Risk management The Group has developed a life insurance risk policy and guidelines on the practical application of this policy.
Individual life insurance risks are managed at a business unit level.
The management of life insurance risk is undertaken primarily in business units but is also monitored at Group level.
The impact of life insurance risks is monitored by the business units as part of the control cycle of business management.
Exposure is monitored through the assessment of liabilities, the asset liability management framework, profit reporting under both IFRS and EEV, financial condition reporting, and the ICA process.
Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group Risk Monitoring framework and overseen by the Life Insurance Risk Committee.
At Group level the overall exposure to life insurance risk is measured through the ICA, FCRs, and other management reporting.
The Life Insurance Risk Committee monitors the risk framework developed and implemented in each business, and receives management information on life insurance risks.
The committee considers all areas of life insurance risk, but in particular has a remit to monitor mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency, pricing, unit pricing and expenses.
The committee also considers the reinsurance coverage across the life businesses.
It confirms that guidance and procedures are in place for each of the major components of life insurance risk, and that businesses adopt a risk management framework to mitigate against any life insurance risk outside local appetite, within the parameters for the overall Group risk appetite.
The framework adopted in business units is reviewed in detail and approved twice yearly.
The committee has also developed guidance for business units on management of a number of areas of life insurance risk to ensure best practice is shared throughout the group and common standards are adopted.
Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance.
The Group allows business units to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but assesses the overall programme to manage group-wide risk exposures and monitor the aggregation of risk ceded to individual reinsurers is within appetite for credit risk.
Longevity risk is carefully monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends.
Whilst individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and the capital implications to manage the impact on the group-wide exposure and the capital funding that businesses may require as a consequence.
The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity where possible and desirable and continually monitors emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.
Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, benchmarked against local market information.
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design.
The Group Life insurance Risk Committee has developed guidelines on persistency management.
Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.
Apart from ICA and FCR, sensitivity testing is widely used to measure the capital required and volatility in earnings due to exposure to life insurance risks, typically through EEV reporting examples of which are contained elsewhere in this report.
This assessment is taken at both business unit level and at Group level where the impact of aggregation of similar risks can be measured.
This enables the Group to determine whether action is required to reduce risk, or whether that risk is within the overall risk appetite.
Concentration risk The Group writes a diverse mix of business in worldwide markets that are all subject to similar risks mortality, persistency etc.
The Group assesses the relative costs and concentrations of each type of risk through the ICA capital requirements and material issues are escalated to and addressed at the Life Insurance Risk committee.
This analysis enables the Group to assess whether accumulations of risk exceeds risk appetite.
One key concentration of life insurance risk for the Group is improving longevity risk from pensions in payment and deferred annuities in the UK and the Netherlands where the Group has material portfolios.
The Group continually monitors this risk and the opportunities for mitigating actions through reinsurance, improved asset liability matching, or innovative solutions that emerge in the market.
When looking at concentrations of risk, for example market risk, the risk within Aviva staff pension schemes is also considered.
ICA analysis and EEV sensitivity testing help identify both concentrations of risk types and the benefits of diversification of risk.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 203 50 Risk management continued Embedded derivatives The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features offering varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms.
The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units.
Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, option to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity option, guaranteed insurability options.
Guarantees: embedded floor guaranteed return, maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment.
Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.
The impact of these is reflected in ICA and EEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.
ii General insurance risk Type of risk General insurance risk in the Group arises from: Fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations: Unexpected claims arising from a single source: Inaccurate pricing of risks when underwritten: Inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques: and Inadequate reserves.
The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group is of a short tail nature such as motor, household and commercial property insurances.
The Groups underwriting strategy and appetite is agreed by the Executive Committee and communicated via specific policy statements and guidelines.
Like life insurance risk, General Insurance risk is managed at business unit level and Group level.
The vast majority of the Groups general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile of the customer.
Risk management Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group Risk monitoring framework.
Additionally, the ICA framework is used to assess the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the Group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and calculating appropriate capital requirements.
Increasingly risk-based capital models are being used to support the quantification of risk under the ICA framework.
All general insurance business units undertake a quarterly review of their insurance risks, the output from which is a key input into the ICA and risk-based capital assessments.
The General Insurance Risk Committee monitors and develops the management of insurance risk in the general insurance business units, and assesses the aggregate risk exposure.
It is responsible for the development, implementation, and review of the Group policies for underwriting, claims handling, reinsurance and reserving that operate within the Group risk management framework.
The implementation of these policies and the management of these risks is supported by sub-committees for each of these four areas of risk.
Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within the limits of the appetite of the Group.
The Group has pioneered various developments, such as the Norwich Union UK Digital Flood Map to effectively manage exposures arising from specific perils.
Where appropriate such projects are employed throughout the business units to promote the adoption of best practice as standard.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 204 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 50 Risk management continued Actuarial management The adequacy of the Groups general insurance claims provisions is ultimately overseen by the Reserving Committee, which covers both life and general insurance reserving.
Actuarial claims reserving is conducted by local actuaries in the various general insurance business units according to the General Insurance Reserving policy.
The General Insurance Risk Committee monitors and maintains the General Insurance Reserving policy, and conducts quarterly reviews of the Groups general insurance claims provisions, and their adequacy.
The reviews are conducted under the direction of the Aviva General Insurance Actuarial Director and include peer reviews of the business units own conclusions as well as independent analysis to confirm the reasonableness of the local reviews.
A number of business units also have periodic external reviews by local consultant actuaries often as part of the local regulatory requirement.
Reinsurance strategy Reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level, to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group.
The basis of these purchases is underpinned by extensive financial and capital modelling and actuarial analysis to optimise the cost and capital efficiency benefits.
For the larger business units, this involves utilising externally sourced probabilistic models to verify the accumulations and loss probabilities based on the Groups specific portfolios of business.
Where external models are not available, scenarios are developed and tested using the Groups data to determine potential losses and appropriate levels of reinsurance protection.
The reinsurance is placed with providers who meet the Groups counterparty security requirements.
Concentration risk Processes are in place to manage catastrophe risk in individual business units and at a Group level.
The Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining economic diversification benefit.
Avivas total retained risk increases as catastrophe events become more remote, so that the total Group loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure Northern European windstorm is approximately 370 million, one in ten years, compared to approximately 700 million, one in 100 years.
e Operational risk Operational risk arises as a result of inadequately controlled internal processes or systems, human error, or from external events.
This definition is intended to include all risks to which the Group is exposed, other than the financial risks described previously, and strategic and Group risks that are considered elsewhere.
Hence, operational risks include for example, information technology, information security, human resources, project management, outsourcing, tax, legal, fraud and compliance risks.
In accordance with Group policies, business unit management has primary responsibility for the effective identification, management, monitoring and reporting of risks to the business unit executive management team and to Group as part of the quarterly risk reporting process.
Each operational risk is assessed by considering the potential impact and the probability of the event occurring.
Impact assessments are made against financial, operational and reputational criteria.
Business unit risk management and governance functions are responsible for implementing the Group risk management methodologies and frameworks to assist line management in this work.
They also provide support and independent challenge on the completeness, accuracy and consistency of risk assessments, and the adequacy of mitigating action plans.
As a result, the business unit executive management team satisfies itself that all material risks falling outside our risk appetite are being mitigated, monitored and reported at an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high impact level are continually monitored centrally.
The Group Operational Risk Committee ORC has been established and determines the risk appetite that the group can work within for these types of risk, assesses and monitors overall operational risk exposures, identifying any concentrations of operational risk across the group, and in particular verifies that mitigating action plans are implemented.
f Liquidity risk The Group has a strong liquidity position and through the application of a Group Liquidity Management policy seeks to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
In addition to its strong liquidity position, the Group maintains significant committed borrowing facilities from a range of highly rated banks to further mitigate this risk.

Primarily, EEV, FCRs, and increasingly ICA are used.
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on all of the Groups financial performance measurements to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks that each of its business units, and the Group as a whole are exposed to.
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of EEV performance indicators to changes in both economic and non-economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
More information on EEV sensitivities can be found in the presentation of results on an EEV basis in the supplementary notes to this report.
Life insurance and Investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates, and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under EEV methodology.
General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims development on which the projections are based.
As such, in the analysis below, the sensitivity of general insurance claim liabilities is primarily based on the financial impact of changes to the reported loss ratio.
Some results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and non-insurance business are set out below.
For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged.
Sensitivity Factor Description of sensitivity factor applied Interest rate and investment return The impact of a change in market interest rates by 1% e. g. if a current interest rate is 5%, the impact of an immediate change to 4% and 6%.

The different impacts of the economic sensitivities on profit and shareholders' equity arise from classification of certain assets as available for sale in some business units, for which movements in unrealised gains or losses would be taken directly to shareholders' equity.
The economic impacts on profit before tax for insurance contracts relate mainly to the effect of minimum return guarantees in the Netherlands.
However in the case of the interest rate sensitivities, the impacts on shareholders' equity are more than offset by the effect of changes in the market value of fixed interest securities in the United States that are classified as available for sale.
The mortality sensitivities relate primarily to the UK and Ireland.
The impact on the Groups results from sensitivity to these assumptions can also be found in the EEV sensitivities included in the alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, the actual impact of a change in the assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets are held at market value on the balance sheet.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty: and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.

The foreign exchange gain of 59 million 2005: 19 million on translation of the debt to sterling at the balance sheet date was recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the current and prior year.
