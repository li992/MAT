3 US Agency retained interests are securities whose principal and interest have been guaranteed by various United States government sponsored enterprises GSEs.
These GSEs include the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac, and the Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are federally regulated but are privately owned.
These GSEs guarantee that the holders of their mortgage-backed securities will receive payments of interest and principal.
Securities guaranteed by either of these two GSEs, although not formally rated, are regarded as having a credit rating equivalent to AAA.
Ginnie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on all of its mortgage-backed securities, and its guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.
5 Prepayment speed has been stressed on an overall portfolio basis for US Agency retained interests due to the overall homogeneous nature of the collateral.
Consumer and commercial retained interests have been stressed on a security level basis.
The sensitivities depicted in the preceding table are Mortgage-backed securities hypothetical and should be used with caution.
The likelihood of The Group sells originated mortgage loans to US government those percent variations selected for sensitivity testing is not sponsored enterprises in return for securities backed by these necessarily indicative of expected market movements because loans and guaranteed by the Agency whilst retaining the rights the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the to service the mortgages.

Also, the effect of a subsequently sold.
The purchaser has recourse to the Group variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of a for losses up to pre-determined levels on certain designated retained interest is calculated without changing any other mortgages.
The Group is not obliged, and does not intend, to assumptions.
This might not be the case in actual market support losses that may be suffered by the Agencies.
Under conditions since changes in one factor might result in changes the terms of the sale agreements, the Agencies have agreed to other factors.
Further, the sensitivities depicted above do not to seek repayment only from the cash from the mortgage consider any corrective actions that the Group might take to loans.
Once the securities exchanged for the loans have been mitigate the effect of any adverse changes in one or more key sold the Groups exposure is restricted to the amount of the assumptions.
At 31 December 2006 mortgages amounting to 144 million 2005 385 million had been sold with recourse to US GSEs.
These loans have been derecognised.
