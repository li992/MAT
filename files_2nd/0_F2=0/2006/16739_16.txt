NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 31 MARCH 2006 1.
General Information Viridian Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Northern Ireland.
The accounts are presented in Sterling with all values rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where otherwise indicated.
At the date of authorisation of these accounts, the following standards, which have not been applied in these accounts, were in issue but not yet effective: IAS 1 Amendment - Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 - Financial Guarantee Contracts IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 - Day 1 Profits IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 - Fair Value Option IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 - Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intra Group Transactions The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application.
Accounting Policies Basis of preparation For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group and Company prepared their annual report and accounts in accordance with UK GAAP.
For the year ended 31 March 2006, the accounts have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Northern Ireland Order 1986.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 34.
The principal accounting policies are set out below: Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Viridian Group PLC the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment in value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowed in IFRS 1 from restating business combinations which occurred before the transition date 1 April 2004.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions prior to the transition date has been retained at the previous UK GAAP balance subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Foreign currency translation The functional and presentation currency of the Company is Sterling.
The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the Euro.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date are recognised in the income statement.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the average rates of exchange for the period.
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign entity is sold, such translation differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are recorded at the closing rate of exchange at each balance sheet date.

Accounting Policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are included in the balance sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate portion of overheads.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Infrastructure and generation assets - up to 40 years Non-operational buildings - freehold and long leasehold - up to 50 years Fixtures and equipment - up to 25 years Vehicles and mobile plant - up to 5 years From 1 April 2005, the method of depreciation for infrastructure assets was changed from 3% for the first 20 years followed by 2% for the remaining 20 years to a straight-line basis, namely 2.5% over 40 years.
The revised basis is consistent with the policy adopted by the majority of UK DNOs and is considered to be more reflective of the consumption of the economic benefits of the infrastructure assets.
In accordance with IAS 8 Presentation of Financial Statements and Accounting Policies this change in method of depreciation is being accounted for prospectively and has resulted in a reduction in the depreciation charge for the year ended 31 March 2006 of 4.5m from what it would otherwise have been.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net selling price and the carrying amount of the asset.
Intangible assets Software costs The costs of acquiring computer software are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life of the software which is between three and ten years.
Costs include direct labour relating to software development and an appropriate portion of directly attributable overheads.
Research and development costs Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An asset is recognised when all the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Any expenditure recognised as an asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
The carrying value of the asset is reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use and subsequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net selling price and the carrying amount of the asset.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of average purchase price and net realisable value.
Accounting Policies continued Financial instruments Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term managed funds with maturity of three months or less.
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at cost, being the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swap contracts and commodity contracts to hedge the risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net income or expense.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures in these accounts.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Share-based payments The Group has a number of all-employee and discretionary employee share schemes under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to eligible employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is estimated using appropriate models for the particular awards under consideration.
As allowed under its transitional provisions, IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested on 1 January 2005.
Operating lease contracts Leases are classified as operating lease contracts whenever the terms of the lease do not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership to the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease in these accounts.
48 Notes to the Accounts Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005-2006 2.
Accounting Policies continued Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, exclusive of value added tax and other sales related taxes.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Energy supply Revenue is recognised on the basis of energy supplied during the period.
Revenue for energy supply includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the balance sheet date, estimated using historical consumption patterns.
Long-term contract accounting Profit on long-term contracts is taken as the work is carried out if the outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The profit included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the period end, by recording revenue and related costs as contract activity progresses.
Revenue is calculated as that proportion of total contract value which costs incurred to date bear to total expected costs for that contract.
Revenues derived from variations on contracts are recognised only when they have been accepted by the customer.
Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Support and maintenance revenue Support and maintenance revenue invoiced in advance is deferred and released to the income statement over the term of the support and maintenance period.
Interest receivable Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Capitalised interest Interest on funding attributable to significant capital projects is capitalised during the period of construction and written off as part of the total cost over the estimated useful economic life of the asset.
All other interest payable and receivable is reflected in the income statement as it arises.
Government grants and customer contributions Government grants and customer contributions received in respect of property, plant and equipment are deferred and released to the income statement by instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of the related assets.
Grants received in respect of expenditure charged to the income statement during the year are included in the income statement.
Tax The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years as well as items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Dividends Dividends are recorded in the Groups accounts in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Accounting Policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when i the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event ii it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and iii a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is included within finance costs.
Emission allowances The Group recognises liabilities in respect of its obligations to deliver emission allowances to the extent that the allowances to be delivered exceed those previously acquired by the Group, either by allocation from governments or a similar body or through purchase.
Any liabilities recognised are measured based on the current estimates of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the net obligation.
Decommissioning Provision is made for estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the estimated useful economic lives of the Groups generation assets on a discounted basis based on price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates are dealt with prospectively.
Capitalised decommissioning costs are depreciated over the estimated useful economic lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of assets.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the liabilities.
Full actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and updated at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
The expected return on pension scheme assets and the interest on pension scheme liabilities are included within finance costs.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowed in IFRS 1 to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the transition date in reserves.
The Group has also adopted IAS 19 Amendment - Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
Companys investments in subsidiaries The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost.
Income is recognised from these investments only in relation to distributions received from post-acquisition profits.
Distributions received in excess of post-acquisition profits are deducted from the cost of investment.

Development costs and software costs are amortised over their finite useful economic lives.
Impairment testing Goodwill arising on acquisitions has been capitalised and is reviewed for impairment annually.
For the purposes of impairment testing the carrying value of the Groups goodwill relates to two cash generating units - Sx3 and Huntstown 1.
The Group disposed of Sx3 on 25 April 2005.
The recoverable amount at 31 March 2005 in respect of Sx3 was calculated using its fair value less costs to sell.
The recoverable amount in respect of Huntstown 1 goodwill 1.4m at 31 March 2006 is based on its value-in-use, which has been determined using discounted future cash flows.
The cash flow projections cover a 27 year period, being the estimated remaining useful life of Huntstown 1.
The key assumptions relate to Huntstown 1 plant performance and wholesale electricity prices.
The plant performance assumptions regarding availability and efficiency take into account the plants long-term maintenance plan and normal plant degradation.
The wholesale electricity price forecasts are derived from managements expectations regarding the SEM, electricity demand growth, generation plant additions and retirements, fuel and CO costs, 2 financing costs and other plant running costs.
The projections are based on business plans for a period of 5 years which have been reviewed by the Board and management forecasts thereafter.
The assumptions regarding electricity demand growth in the RoI are based on Eirgrids published forecasts for the first 5 years: thereafter the demand growth rate assumption is approximately 2% per annum.
The cash flows were discounted using a pre tax nominal discount rate of 10%.

Foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges The Group has entered into foreign exchange contracts in respect of forecast Sterling costs of its Euro-denominated RoI subsidiaries for the year ending 31 March 2007.
The timing and amount of these foreign exchange contracts match the forecast requirements and the contracts are considered effective hedges.
At 31 March 2006 the fair value of foreign exchange contracts was 1.2m 2005 - 1.7m.
At 31 March 2006 an unrealised gain of 0.9m 2005 - 1.5m, net of deferred tax of 0.1m 2005 - 0.2m, relating to foreign exchange contracts is included in equity.
During the year, realised gains of 2.5m 2005 - 0.1m were removed from equity and are primarily included within energy costs in the income statement in respect of completed hedges.
During the year gains of 0.2m 2005 - nil were realised in respect of foreign exchange contracts for which hedge accounting was discontinued due to the hedge designation being revoked.
Losses of 0.2m 2005 - nil were realised in respect of foreign exchange contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts has been calculated by applying the forward price derived from third party market price quotations.
Derivative Financial Instruments continued Commodity swaps - cash flow hedges The Group has entered into commodity swap contracts in respect of forecast gas purchases for the year ending 31 March 2007.
The timing and amount of the swap contracts match the forecast requirements and the contracts are considered effective hedges.
At 31 March 2006 the fair value of commodity swap contracts was 9.0m 2005 - 4.5m.
At 31 March 2006 an unrealised gain of 7.9m 2005 - 3.9m, net of deferred tax of 1.1m 2005 - 0.6m, relating to swap contracts is included in equity.
During the year, realised gains of 16.3m 2005 - 3.2m were removed from equity and are included within energy costs in the income statement in respect of completed hedges.
During the year losses of 1.8m 2005 - nil were realised in respect of commodity swaps for which hedge accounting was discontinued due to the hedge designation being revoked.
Gains of 1.8m 2005 - nil were made in respect of commodity swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of commodity contracts has been calculated by applying the forward price derived from third party market price quotations.
Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges The Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts whereby it pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate of interest on the outstanding principal of certain Euro-denominated borrowings.
The terms of the swap contracts match the loan profile and the contracts are considered effective hedges.
At 31 March 2006 the fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 12.8m 2005 - 17.1m.
At 31 March 2006 an unrealised loss of 11.0m 2005 - 14.8m, net of deferred tax of 1.8m 2005 - 2.3m, relating to swap contracts is included in equity.
During the year, realised losses of 4.5m 2005 - 4.8m were removed from equity and are included within finance costs in the income statement in respect of completed hedges.
The fair value of interest rate swaps has been valued by calculating the present value of future cash flows, estimated using forward rates from third party market price quotations.
Sensitivity Analysis - Financial Instruments At 31 March 2006, the Group is exposed to future changes in the fair value of unsettled derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis for each type of market risk showing the impact on equity is set out below.
These sensitivities are based on an assessment of market rate movements during the year and each is considered to be a reasonably possible range.
There is no impact on the income statement.
The impact on the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is calculated by increasing decreasing by 2% the effective Sterling:Euro exchange rates of third party price quotations.
The impact on the fair value of commodity swaps is calculated by increasing decreasing by 5p the effective commodity prices of third party price quotations.
The impact on the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by increasing decreasing by 1% the Euro interest rates of third party price quotations.

As at 31 March 2006, the Group had Euro-denominated net assets of 23.4m 2005 - nil.
A 2% increase decrease in the Sterling:Euro exchange rate would decrease increase the Groups net assets by 0.4m.

Liability and damage claims Notwithstanding the intention of the directors to defend vigorously claims made against the Group, liability and damage claim provisions have been made which represent the directors best estimate of costs expected to arise from ongoing third party litigation matters and employee claims.
These provisions are expected to be utilised within a period not exceeding five years.
Provision for former associate Lislyn Limited Provision has been made for obligations expected to arise in respect of those members of Lislyns defined benefit pension scheme who were employees of NIE at privatisation.
The provision is expected to be utilised within the next year.
Decommissioning Provision has been made for decommissioning Huntstown 1.
The provision represents the present value of the current estimated costs of closure of the plant at the end of its useful economic life.
The provision has been discounted using a rate of 4.43% 2005 - 4.43% and is expected to be utilised within a period not exceeding thirty years.
Environment Provision has been made for expected costs of decontamination and demolition arising from privatisation obligations in respect of power station sites formerly owned by NIE.
It is anticipated that most expenditure will take place within the next five years.
Lease Obligations Property, plant and equipment The Group has entered into leases on certain items of property, plant and equipment.
These leases contain options for renewal before the expiry of the lease term at rentals based on market prices at the time of renewal.
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Within one year 1.4 2.8 After one year but not more than five years 2.8 7.4 More than five years 2.5 7.4 6.7 17.6 PPAs NIE has entered into PPAs with generating companies in Northern Ireland to make payments for the availability of generating capacity as well as for the purchase of electricity generated.
The principal contracts are with Premier Power Ltd Ballylumford, AES Kilroot Power Ltd Kilroot and ESB Independent Energy Limited Coolkeeragh.
The main Ballylumford contracts expire in 2012 but NIE has options to extend up to 2022.
Payment terms for these extension periods are pre-defined in the contracts.
The Kilroot contracts expire in 2024 but NIAER has early contract cancellation rights that can be exercised from November 2010.
The Coolkeeragh contracts expire in 2020 but again NIAER has early contract cancellation rights that can be exercised from November 2010.
Under IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, the PPAs are deemed to contain lease arrangements.
Under IAS 17 Leases, these lease arrangements are classified as operating leases and the availability payments are classified as operating lease rentals.
The availability payments are dependent on the availability of the generators and are therefore variable in nature.
The estimated future minimum lease payments are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Within one year 142.1 129.5 After one year but not more than five years 520.4 568.0 More than five years 65.3 159.8 727.8 857.3 As a result of changes in environmental legislation, FGD equipment is being installed at the Kilroot plant.
Under the terms of the PPA, Kilroot will be entitled to increase its availability charges to recover the cost of installation, including financing, when the equipment is commissioned.
The amounts disclosed in the table above do not include this cost, which is estimated at 35m.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities i Capital commitments At 31 March 2006 the Group had contracted future capital expenditure in respect of property, plant and equipment of 122.9m 2005 - 8.9m.
ii Contingent liabilities Contract buy-out agreement In December 2000 a number of the PPA contracts at Ballylumford were renegotiated.
As part of these arrangements a contract buy-out CBO agreement was entered into to make payments to fund a buy-out of the profit element under the original agreements at Ballylumford.
The CBO agreement has provisions under which a termination amount becomes payable in certain circumstances.
The size of the payment depends on the termination date.
NIE does not anticipate that any liability will arise and no provision has been made.
Protected persons The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of obligations under the Electricity Protected Persons Pensions Regulations Northern Ireland 1992 to protect the pension rights of employees of NIE at privatisation.
This includes members employed in companies which have subsequently been disposed of by the Group.
The Group does not anticipate that any liability will arise other than that recognised in the accounts.
Power station sites NIE leases sites to power stations in Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the lease agreements NIE may be required to pay compensation if a lease is terminated.
Since the extent of the compensation will depend on the circumstances which give rise to the termination, it is not possible to identify the magnitude of any potential liability.
NIE does not anticipate that any liability for compensation will arise and no provision has been made.
PPAs Under the terms of the PPAs, where modifications to generating equipment are necessary as a result of a change in law and a generator is unable to procure the necessary financing, NIE must either provide such finance or pay the costs incurred by the generator in carrying out such modifications.
The costs incurred by NIE in meeting these obligations are recoverable under its Licence, but will require to be financed by NIE until such recovery is achieved.
NIE does not anticipate any liability for modifications which require financing and no provision has been made.
Property clawback A clawback debenture was entered into in 1993 which entitled DETI to a proportion of any property gain above certain thresholds accruing or treated as accruing to any member of the Group as a result of disposals, or events treated as disposals deemed disposals, occurring after 31 March 1993 in relation to land and any buildings on that land in which NIE had an interest at 31 March 1993.
These arrangements lasted until 31 March 2003.
NIE is in dispute with DETI in connection with valuations relating to the possibility of any clawback liability payable as a result of disposal by NIE of property at its Danesfort site and of some other retail properties.
The parties have agreed that the dispute should be determined by an independent expert under the terms of the clawback debenture.
A provision for clawback in respect of property disposals has been made only to the extent that it is probable that a liability will crystallise.

Share-Based Payments i Share-based payments expense The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 31 March 2006 was 1.3m 2005 - 0.6m.
This expense relates to the Groups share option schemes and to the PSP, CIP and SIP.
All these schemes are equity-settled.
In accordance with the exception permitted under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, no expense has been recognised in respect of options over 290,152 shares 2005 - 925,766 which were granted before 7 November 2002. ii Share option schemes The Company operates an all-employee Sharesave Scheme and a discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme.
The all-employee Sharesave Scheme is a savings related scheme whereby employees enter into a three year save-as-you-earn contract with options to acquire shares.
The exercise price represents 80% of the market price at the time of grant.
The options are exercisable during the six month period following the three year savings contract.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, the exercise price of options granted is the market price at the time of grant.
The options are generally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The exercise of options under both the all-employee Sharesave Scheme and the Executive Share Option Scheme is subject to continuous employment over a three year period.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Share-Based Payments continued ii Share option schemes continued The number of options outstanding, the weighted average remaining contractual life and the weighted average exercise price as at 31 March for the following range of exercise prices were as follows: 2006 Options Weighted average remaining Weighted average Outstanding contractual life exercise price Number Years Pence Sharesave Scheme 402.0p 19,270 0.3 402.0 694.0p 741,665 3.3 694.0 Executive Share Option Scheme 465.0p 478.0p 69,945 5.8 466.0 534.5p 581.0p 488,784 7.5 554.6 638.5p 656.0p 115,697 4.4 644.8 731.0p 741.5p 177,202 6.6 736.4 2005 Options Weighted average remaining Weighted average Outstanding contractual life exercise price Number Years Pence Sharesave Scheme 402.0p 1,568,859 1.3 402.0 Executive Share Option Scheme 465.0p 478.0p 428,110 7.1 465.2 534.5p 581.0p 574,076 8.1 555.6 638.5p 656.0p 225,710 5.2 647.1 731.0p 741.5p 202,498 5.2 741.5 The weighted average share price at the exercise date for options exercised during the year under the Sharesave Scheme was 922.0p 2005 - 618.8p and for options exercised under the Executive Share Option Scheme was 803.0p 2005 - 703.3p.
The fair values of options granted under the Sharesave Scheme and Executive Share Option Scheme were measured at the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The input data was as follows: Sharesave Executive Share Option Scheme Scheme 2006 2005 2006 2005 Share price at the date of grant 851.5 - 741.0 600.0 1 Exercise price pence 694.0 - 731.0 573.5 Volatility % 18.0 - 19.0 18.0 2 2 Expected dividend yield % 4.6 - 5.3 6.3 Expected life of options years 3 - 4 4 Risk free rate of interest % 4.2 - 4.2 5.2 Option fair value pence 165.0 - 83.0 68.0 1 The exercise price of options at the date of grant is set by reference to the market value of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding or, if the Board so determines, the average market value over the three preceding dealing days.
2 The expected dividend yield is calculated based on actual dividends paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2005 and the dividend growth rate during that year.
The expected dividend yield is indicative only.
The expected volatility is based on historical data over a period equal to the expected life of the option which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

Share-Based Payments continued iii PSP and CIP The Company operates the PSP and the CIP share award plans: PSP: Under the PSP conditional share awards are granted to a maximum value of 100% of basic salary.
Up to 2004 05 awards were made to executive directors only.
During 2005 06, in addition to executive directors, awards were made to certain senior managers.
The 2004 05 awards were subject to the Companys TSR over a three year performance period relative to a group of comparator companies.
50% of the 2005 06 award is based on the Companys TSR over a three year period relative to the constituents of the FTSE mid-250 Index excluding investment trusts.
The other 50% of the 2005 06 award is based on the average ROCE achieved by the Group over a three year period.
Both the 2004 05 and 2005 06 awards vest following the third anniversary of the grant date.
CIP: During 2005 06, conditional awards were made to executive directors and certain senior managers under the CIP.
Participants can invest in the Companys shares up to the value of 20% of gross annual salary or 100% of gross performance bonus whichever is higher.
Matching shares are awarded after three years, at a minimum level of 50% of shares invested, up to a maximum level of 150% dependent on the achievement of the same performance conditions as those applying to the PSP.
Matching award shares vest following the third anniversary of the grant date.
The fair values of awards granted under the PSP and CIP were measured at the date of grant taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The fair value of awards granted is based on the market value of the shares at the date of grant less expected dividends over the three year vesting period.
The fair value of awards based on relative TSR performance assumes that there is equal probability of achieving any TSR ranking.
The fair value of awards based on ROCE reflects the ROCE achieved in the first year of the performance period.
The assumptions used to value the conditional share awards granted during the year were as follows: PSP CIP 2006 2005 2006 2005 Number of conditional share awards granted 173,594 129,742 81,196 - Share price at the date of grant pence 801.0 566.5 801.0 - 1 1 Expected dividends per share pence 115.3 110.4 115.3 - Element of awards based on TSR performance: - Expected value % 40.6 44.0 58.3 - - Fair value pence 278.4 200.7 400.0 - Element of awards based on ROCE performance: - Fair value pence 685.7 - 685.7 - 1 The expected dividends per share are calculated based on actual dividends paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2005 and the dividend growth rate during that year.
The expected dividends are indicative only.
iv SIP The all-employee SIP enables eligible UK based employees to buy shares in the Company out of pre tax salary, subject to a limit of 125 per month.
The Company currently awards one free share for every share purchased up to a limit of 50 per month: the fair value of these awards is the cost of purchasing the shares.
During 2005 06 52,863 shares 2005 - 4,471 were purchased by the trustees of the SIP on behalf of 791 employees at a total cost of 433,000 2005 - 33,000.
Pension Commitments Most employees of the Group are members of VGPS.
"This has two sections: ""Options"" which is a money purchase arrangement whereby the Group generally matches members contributions up to a maximum of 6% of salary and ""Focus"" which provides benefits based on pensionable salary at retirement or earlier exit from service."
There is a money purchase arrangement for employees in the RoI known as Choices: its benefits mirror those of the Options section of VGPS.
In addition the CPP provides benefits for salary above HMRCs earnings cap to certain executive directors.
The assets of the schemes are held under trust and invested by the trustees on the advice of professional investment managers.
Hewitt, the actuaries to VGPS, have provided a valuation of Focus and the CPP under IAS 19 at 31 March 2006 based on the following assumptions in nominal terms and using the projected unit method: 2006 2005 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9% per annum 3.9% per annum Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.9% per annum 3.0% per annum Discount rate 5.0% per annum 5.3% per annum Inflation assumption 2.9% per annum 2.9% per annum Life expectancy: Current pensioners at age 60 - males 23.1 years 22.9 years Current pensioners at age 60 - females 25.9 years 25.9 years Future pensioners at age 60 - males 23.9 years 23.8 years Future pensioners at age 60 - females 26.6 years 26.7 years The life expectancy assumptions are based on standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
The valuation under IAS 19 at 31 March 2006 shows a net pension liability before deferred tax of 102.9m 2005 - 168.6m.
A 0.1% increase decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease increase the net pension liability by 15m.
A 0.1% increase decrease in the assumed inflation rate would increase decrease the net pension liability by 15m.
Assets and liabilities The assets and liabilities of Focus and the CPP and the expected rates of return are: Value at Expected Value at Expected 31 March rate of 31 March rate of 2006 return 2005 return m % m % Equities 455.7 7.5 407.2 7.0 Bonds 378.6 4.7 294.4 5.3 Other 3.7 4.3 2.1 4.5 Total market value of assets 838.0 703.7 Actuarial value of liabilities 940.9 872.3 Net pension liability 102.9 168.6 The net pension liability is disclosed as follows: Pension liability - continuing operations 102.9 161.1 Pension liability - discontinued operations - 7.5 Net pension liability 102.9 168.6 80 Notes to the Accounts Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005-2006 32.
Pension Commitments continued The expected rate of return on equities is based on the expected median return over the long-term.
The expected rate of return on bonds is measured directly from actual market yields for UK gilts and corporate bonds.
Other assets include cash balances and net current assets.
The expected rate of return on these assets is measured directly from short-term market interest rates.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the net pension liability recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of 168.6m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since the inception of Focus and the CPP.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense shown before 1 April 2004.

Explanation of Transition to IFRS Overview of IFRS reconciliations For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group prepared its annual report and accounts in accordance with UK GAAP.
For the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group is required to prepare its annual report and accounts in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU.
Accordingly, these accounts have been prepared in compliance with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005: the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in note 2.
In preparing these accounts, the Group has started from a balance sheet at 1 April 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS.
Detailed reconciliations of the Group Income Statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 and Balance Sheets at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 under IFRS to the results and financial position previously reported under UK GAAP are set out on pages 87 to 89.
Exemptions applied The Group has applied the following exemptions as permitted by IFRS 1: IAS 19 Employee Benefits: All cumulative actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in accumulated profits at the transition date: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: IFRS 2 has been applied in respect of all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested on 1 January 2005, the effective date of IFRS 2: IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Business combinations prior to the transition date have not been restated: and IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: The foreign currency translation reserve has been set to zero at the transition date.
The effect of moving from UK GAAP to IFRS had the following impact on the Group for the year ended 31 March 2005: Profit for the year increased by 2.8m.
Basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations increased by 2.1p.
Net assets reduced by 147.6m as at 31 March 2005 mainly as a result of recognition of the deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme and the Groups deferred tax liability no longer being discounted.
IFRS Summary of impact on the Group IFRS adjustments The adjustments that have been made to the Group figures as previously reported under UK GAAP are explained below: IAS 19 Employee Benefits Under UK GAAP, the Group applied the provisions of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs and provided detailed disclosures under Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits in accounting for pensions.
The Groups policy was to recognise a charge for its defined benefit pension arrangements in arriving at operating profit.
This cost comprised the regular cost of providing pensions and a charge or credit relating to the amortisation of actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining service lives of the employees covered by the relevant arrangements.
The difference between the cumulative charge for pensions and the cumulative contributions paid was previously recognised as an asset on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, the Group has applied the provisions of IAS 19.
Under IAS 19, accounting for pensions reflects, at each balance sheet date, the surplus or deficit in relation to defined benefit pension arrangements.
IAS 19 permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Groups accounting policy is to recognise any actuarial gains and losses in full immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The liability recognised under IAS 19 in respect of Focus and the CPP amounted to 168.6m at 31 March 2005 2004 - 168.6m.
Under IAS 19, an accrual of 1.1m 2004 - 1.1m was also recognised in respect of holiday pay.
The related deferred tax asset was 50.9m 2004 - 50.9m.
In addition, under IFRS, the SSAP 24 pension prepayment of 8.9m at 31 March 2005 2004 - 8.9m was removed.
IAS 19 allows separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension arrangements in the income statement.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 on the Groups income statement was to increase operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 3.8m, increase net finance costs by 2.8m and hence increase profit before tax by 1.0m.
The level of costs for pensions will vary depending on, amongst other things, the benefits given to members and assumptions relating to interest rates, the expected return on the pension schemes assets and mortality rates.
As the balance sheet under IFRS reflects the deficit in the Groups pension scheme, changes in the deficit due to, amongst other things, interest rates and actuarial assumptions, will impact reported net assets.
The Group has decided not to adopt the corridor approach under IAS 19 and will continue to show the full pension surplus or deficit on the balance sheet going forward.

Explanation of Transition to IFRS continued IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for its employee share schemes on an intrinsic value basis, except for the Groups Sharesave Scheme which was excluded from these accounting requirements.
Under IFRS, all employee share schemes including the Sharesave Scheme are accounted for using fair value models.
All equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested on 1 January 2005 have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The impact of applying IFRS 2 was to increase operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 0.7m.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 increased by 0.8m 2004 - decrease of 0.3m.
The increase in profit was primarily due to the release of accruals made under UK GAAP: otherwise a charge would have been expected.
IAS 12 Income Taxes IFRS prohibit the discounting of deferred tax which had been the Groups policy under UK GAAP.
This led to an increase in the net deferred tax liability of 46.0m as at 31 March 2005 2004 - 44.3m.
In addition, under IFRS, a provision of 1.5m 2004 - 2.7m was made in respect of temporary timing differences.
The impact of applying IAS 12 was to decrease profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 0.5m.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill was required to be amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill is frozen and no future amortisation is charged.
However, the goodwill is subject to a mandatory impairment test at least annually and otherwise if there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill amortisation of 2.1m for the year ended 31 March 2005 was reversed in the income statement under IFRS.
IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date Under UK GAAP, dividends proposed after the balance sheet date were accrued in the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, final dividends are not recorded until the date they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
This adjustment, which is only a timing difference, increased Group net assets by 33.8m at 31 March 2005 2004 - 32.3m.
IAS 39 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments IAS 39 requires the fair value of derivatives including foreign currency and commodity contracts and interest rate swap agreements to be accounted for as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet.
The application of IAS 39 resulted in the recognition of derivative financial assets of 7.2m 2004 - 3.3m and liabilities of 18.1m 2004 - 16.2m, in both cases before deferred tax, at 31 March 2005.
IAS 39 had no impact on the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 as all derivatives were designated as effective hedges of future cash flows.
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Under UK GAAP, the income statements of foreign subsidiaries were translated to Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, the income statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rates of exchange for the period.
The effect of adopting IAS 21 on the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 was to reduce profit by 0.3m 2004 - nil.
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations The assets and liabilities of Sx3 were classified as held for sale at 31 March 2005 as the result of the criteria for disposal groups being applied.
The results of Sx3 for the years ended 31 March 2006 and 2005 have been included within discontinued operations in the income statement.
Explanation of Transition to IFRS continued IFRS reclassifications In addition to the above adjustments, a number of reclassification adjustments have been made to the income statement and balance sheet.
The principal reclassifications from UK GAAP to IFRS are: IAS 38 Intangible Assets Under UK GAAP, capitalised software was included within tangible fixed assets.
Under IFRS, capitalised software that is not an integral part of the related hardware is recorded as an intangible asset.
This reclassification had no effect on the amortisation of software costs for the year ended 31 March 2005.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Under IFRS, the current and non-current components of trade and other receivables payables, provisions and deferred income are required to be shown separately.
This was not a requirement under UK GAAP.
IAS 12 Income Taxes Under UK GAAP, deferred tax assets were netted against deferred tax liabilities.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are included in non-current assets.
IAS 39 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments Under UK GAAP, accrued interest was presented separately from the financial instrument to which it related.
Under IAS 39 the carrying value of borrowings and derivative financial assets and liabilities includes accrued interest.
IAS 7 Cash Flow Statement The IFRS cash flow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP with cash flows split into three categories - operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
The change in presentation has no net impact on the Groups underlying cash flows or business strategy.
In the cash flow statement under IFRS, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term managed funds with maturity of three months or less.
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Under IFRS, the retranslation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries taken to the accumulated profits reserve for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been reclassified within the foreign currency translation reserve.
