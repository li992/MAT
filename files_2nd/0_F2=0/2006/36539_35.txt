UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAx Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the group can control whether gains crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2006 the total of such gains was 900 million and the potential tax effect 270 million 2005: 490 million, potential tax effect 150 million.
If a UK REIT sells a property within three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply.
When such properties are expected to be retained past the three-year period, provision is not made for the tax that could arise on an early disposal.
The properties concerned had an aggregate value at 31 December 2006 of 1,570 million and the unprovided deferred tax was 130 million.
A deferred tax asset of 8.2 million 2005: nil, for carried forward UK tax losses that may not be utilised, was not recognised because it is uncertain whether appropriate taxable profits will arise.
