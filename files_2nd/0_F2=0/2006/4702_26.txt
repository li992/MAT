iv Material tax provisions Over the past 10 years the group has undergone significant restructuring involving the acquisition and disposal of material businesses and the transfer of businesses intra group.
As a consequence of this restructuring, a number of potential tax exposures have arisen.
The group has a provision of 294 million 2005 318 million for these exposures, which is included in corporate tax payable in current liabilities.
In addition, as the group operates throughout the world it faces a number of potential transfer pricing issues in many jurisdictions relating to goods, services and financing.
The issues are often complex and can take many years to resolve.
The total provision contained in the financial statements in respect of these transfer pricing issues is 99 million 2005 192 million.
Of the remaining tax exposures, the group does not expect material additional losses.
Interest is also provided on tax provisions and included in corporate tax payable in current liabilities.
The UK is party to various double tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions which enable Diageos revenues and capital gains to escape a double tax charge to both UK and foreign jurisdiction tax.
If any of these double tax treaties should be withdrawn or amended, or should any member of the Diageo group become involved in taxation disputes with any tax authority, such withdrawal, amendment or a negative outcome of such disputes could have a material adverse effect on Diageos financial condition and results of operations.
v Corporate tax payable The current corporate tax liability of 681 million 2005 777 million represents the amount of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior periods that exceed payments made.
