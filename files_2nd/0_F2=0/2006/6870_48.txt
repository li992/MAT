The Groups treasury policy has as its principal objective the achievement of the maximum rate of return on cash balances whilst maintaining an acceptable level of risk.
Other than mentioned below there are no financial instruments, derivatives or commodity contracts used.
Financial assets and liabilities The Groups main financial asset comprises cash and cash equivalents.
Other financial assets include trade receivables arising from the Groups activities.
Other than trade and other payables, the Group had no financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 as at 30 December 2006 2005: nil.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 10,000,000 of which 10,000,000 was undrawn at 30 December 2006 2005: 10,000,000 undrawn.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying values.
Interest rate, credit and foreign currency risk The Group has not entered into any hedging transactions during the year and considers interest rate, credit and foreign currency risks not to be significant.

Operating leases Total amounts payable under non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows: 2006 2005 Operating leases which expire: 000 000 In less than one year 898 762 Between one and five years 28,431 23,528 After more than five years 128,014 139,442 157,343 163,732 The Group leases the majority of its shops under operating leases.
The leases typically run for a period of 10 years, with an option to renew the lease after that date.
Lease payments are generally increased every five years to reflect market rentals.
For a small number of the leases the rental is contingent on the level of turnover achieved in the relevant unit.
The inception of the shop leases has taken place over a long period of time and many date back a significant number of years.
They are combined leases of land and buildings.
It is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between land and buildings at inception.
Therefore, in determining lease classification the Group evaluated whether both parts are clearly an operating lease or a finance lease.
Firstly, land title does not pass.
Secondly, because the rent paid to the landlord for the buildings is increased to market rent at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the building it is judged that substantially all the risks and rewards of the building are with the landlord.
Based on these qualitative factors it is concluded that the leases are operating leases.
Capital commitments During the year ended 30 December 2006, the Group entered into contracts to purchase property, plant and equipment for 11,736,000 2005: 8,067,000.
These commitments are expected to be settled in the following financial year.
