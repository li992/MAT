Investments have been revalued to reflect current market values.
Inventories have been revalued to net realisable value.
Receivables and payables have been revalued to reflect the expected timing and amount of settlements.
External fixed rate debt and derivative financial instruments have been revalued to reflect current market terms.
Deferred gains and losses relating to commodity price and foreign currency hedging arrangements have been fide-recognised.
Provisions include the recognition of accumulated unfunded pension liabilities.
Deferred tax asset and liability balances have been adjusted to take into account fair values for book purposes and resetting of tax bases as a result of the acquisition, where applicable.
Decommissioning, site restoration and environmental rehabilitation provisions are measured at the present value of estimated future costs of rehabilitation.
Adoption of BHP Billitons accounting policy for mined ore stocks held underground which are not recorded as inventory until the ore is brought above ground.

BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2006 223 5041 BHPB AR06 Pt2 13 9 06 10:11 PM Page 224 Notes to Financial Statements continued 36 Acquired operations continued d The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired have been finalised during the 12 months post acquisition.
This has resulted in updates to a number of the provisional fair values reported at 30 June 2005.
The main adjustments relate to: Fair values of inventories and other assets acquired have been updated following review.
Valuations of property, plant and equipment were finalised resulting in an increase to the value allocated to property, plant and equipment to reflect the finalisation of replacement costs and estimated remaining useful lives, in particular in relation to the Olympic Dam operations.
The fair value of mineral assets has increased to reflect the updated estimates of the values of the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired.
In addition, the refinement and validation of the detailed valuation models has led to a decrease in the mineral asset value for the Nickel West operations and an increase for the Olympic Dam operations.
Provisions have increased following a review of the level of provisioning, in particular in relation to site restoration and environmental rehabilitation provisions, offset by decreased provisions relating to transaction related costs.
Net deferred tax liabilities have decreased following the increase in provisions and other liabilities, and a reduction in the estimated temporary difference arising from the resetting of tax bases resulting from the acquisition.
Other liabilities have increased for the fair value of fixed price uranium sales contracts with contract prices below market prices at the date of acquisition.
For presentation purposes, these amounts are classified as deferred income as the amount will be released to revenue as the contracts are fulfilled.
e The overall cost of the acquisition has reduced due to the finalisation of the estimates of acquisition related costs.
f Goodwill represents the excess purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
It represents assets that do not meet the recognition criteria and synergies that are expected to be achieved.
