Share Based Payments Share Option Schemes EmployeeSchemes The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002 adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002 is available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months service.
The scheme provides for employees to save up to 250 per month and gives them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved.
The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the Ordinary Shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation.
The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002 is offered to employees in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Employees in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and France are able to participate respectively in the Smith & Nephew Belgian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew Italian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew DutchSharesave Plan 2002 and the Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2002.
Participants in Ireland are able to participate in the Smith & Nephew Irish Employee Share Option Scheme.
These plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002.
Options are no longer issued under the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 14 May 1981 and the Smith & Nephew 1991 Overseas Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 25 May 1990 but options remain to be exercised under these two schemes.
Togetherall of the plans referred to above are termed the Employee Schemes.
Employees in the United States are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount of 15% or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plans quarterly purchase period to the market price, through a regular savings plan.
ExecutiveSchemes The Smith & Nephew 1985 Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 9 May 1985, the Smith & Nephew 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 15 May 1990, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001 and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2004 are together termed the Executive Schemes.
Under the terms of the Executive Schemes, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan are to acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares.
For options granted prior to 2001, the option price was not less than the market value of an Ordinary Share, or the nominal value if higher.
The market value being the quoted price on the business day preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant.
For Executive Schemes adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an Ordinary Share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or, for the US Plan, the average quoted price of an ADS or Ordinary Share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan, the exercise of options granted from 1997 are subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan are not subject to performance conditions but become exercisable up to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
The 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2004 Plan are open to senior managers worldwide.
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan is open to senior managers outside the US and the US Plan is open to seniormanagers inthe US, Canada, Mexicoand Puerto Rico.
The maximum term of options granted, under all schemes, is 10 years from the date of grant.
All share optionschemes except for the Stock AppreciationRights Plan detailed onpage 116 are settled inshares.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of options exercisable at 31 December 2006 was 3.4 years 2005 2.4 years, 2004 4.3 years for Executive Schemes and 0.2 years 2005 0.4 years, 2004 0.3 years for Employee Schemes.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the year to 31 December 2006 was $7m 2005 $9m, 2004 $15m for Executive Schemes and $3m 2005 $5m, 2004 $5m for Employee Schemes.
The total fair value of options which vested during 2006 was $5m 2005 $6m, 2004 $6m for Executive Schemes and $2m 2005 $3m, 2004 $3m for Employee Schemes.
TheGroup issues new shares to satisfy share optionexercises.
Options granted duringthe year were as follows: Weighted average fair value Share per price Weighted Weighted optionat at average average Options grant grant exercise option granted date date price life Thousand Pence Pence Pence Years Employee Schemes................. 1,511 167.0 466.8 350.6 3.9 Executive Schemes.................. 5,166 150.2 509.7 509.7 6.6 Weighted average fair value of options granted under employee schemes during 2005 was 144p 2004 165p and those underexecutive schemes during2005 was 172p 2004 155p.
Options granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004 under the executive schemes were valued using a binomial model.
Options granted under employee schemes were valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management considered that options granted under these schemes are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
Options granted under each scheme are valued separately and a weighted average fair value calculated.
The binomial model was used for executive schemes so that proper allowance is made for the possibility of early exercise.
At the 2006 grant management expected 95% of the options granted under the 2001 Executive Scheme to vest 2005 95%, 2004 95% and 60% of the 2004 Executive Scheme to vest 2005 60%, 2004 60%.
Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are updated to reflect revised expectations of the number of grants that will vest.
This includes the effects of any modifications to the share schemes during the year.
In 2005 the Group announced its intention to report its results in US Dollars with effect from 2006.
For the 2004 and 2005 awards, the Remuneration Committee decided to retain the same performance targets but base them on US Dollar numbers over the life of the award.
In order to reflect the different EPSA growths under US Dollar reporting the estimates of final vesting were amended for schemes with this criteria.
To the extent that this is a modification, there was no effect on the charge in the income statement.
Commencing in 2006 the impact on the share based payment charge in the income statement was an additional charge of approximately $1m.
There was no effect onthe fair value of the share based payments as a result of this change.
Share Based Payments Share Option Schemes continued For all schemes the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used incalculatingthe fair value of optionsgranted: Employee schemes Executive schemes 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 %, except Expected Life inyears Dividendyield............................. 1.5 1.1 1.1 1.5 1.1 1.1 Expected volatility i........................ 25.0 26.0 23.7 25.0 26.0 22.0 Risk free interest rate ii..................... 4.8 4.1 4.8 4.5 4.8 3.3 -5.1 Expected life inyears iii..................... 3.9 3.9 3.5 6.6 6.4 7.0 i Volatilityisassessed on a  based on pastshare price movements over the expected lifeofthe options.

This is based on a mixture of historic experience and generally accepted behavioural traits.

In addition, 50% 2005 50%, 2004 50% of Executive Scheme option holders are assumed to exercise by choice per annum providing the gain available is at least 50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans 2005 50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans, 2004 50% ofthe option price.
Summarised information about options outstanding under the share option schemes at 31 December 2006 is as follows: Options outstanding Options exercisable Weighted average Weighted Weighted remaining average average Exercisable Number contract exercise Number exercise instages outstanding life price exercisable price up to Thousand Years Pence Thousand Pence Employee Schemes: 289.2p to 403.0p...... 3,103 2.7 353.4 55 321.7 2007 421.0p to 526.0p...... 834 2.7 429.2 3,937 55 Executive Schemes: 145.0p to 417.1p...... 3,252 2.6 340.1 2,797 328.8 2010 418.0p to 582.9p...... 13,660 5.9 511.0 2,531 450.2 2013 16,912 5,328 259,054 2005 330,118, 2004 681,255 options remain outstanding under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan and at 31 December 2006 these have a fair value liability of $2m 2005 $2m, 2004 $4m whichis materially the same as intrinsicvalue.
Share Based Payment Long-Term Incentive Plans The Group operated a long-term incentive plan LTIP for executive directors and executive officers from 1997 to 2003.
Vesting of LTIP awards was dependent on the Groups relative performance in a group of 39 UK listed manufacturing companies with substantial international activities, using total shareholder return TSR over a three year period as the prime measure.
In 2004, a new share based incentive plan was introduced for executive directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the LTIP.
The plan includes a Performance Share Plan PSP and a BonusCo-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based onmajor  medical devices industry.
Under the CIP, participants can elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for 3 years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matchingshares for each share purchased.
Share Based Payment Long-Term Incentive Plans continued The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
The exercise price for all awards granted under the long-term incentive plans is nil.
The LTIP and PSP contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
Given the wide range of companies within the FTSE 100 a correlation of 20% 2005 20%, 2004 20% has been assumed with the constituents of the group.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at 31 December 2006 was $39m.
Thefair value of LTIP awards vesting during2006 was $1m.
26 c. Share Based Payments Charge to Income Statement Theexpense charged to the incomestatement for share based payments is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 $ million Granted incurrentyear.............................................. 5 4 5 Granted inprioryears............................................... 9 9 6 Total share based expense for the year................................. 14 13 11 Under the Executive Schemes, PSP and CIP the number of Ordinary Shares over which options may be granted is limited so that the number of shares issued or that may be issued during the ten years preceding the date of grant shall not exceed 5% of the Ordinary Share capital at the date of grant.
The total number of Ordinary Shares which may be issuable in any ten-year period under all share schemes operated by the Companymay not exceed 10% of the OrdinaryShare capital at the date of grant.
As of 31 December 2006, total unrecognised compensation cost relating to unvested share based payments totalled $26m whichis expected to be recognisedover a weighted average period of 2.1 years.
