Those calculations use cash ow projections based on actual operating results and management projections for a further six years.
Cash ows for further periods are extrapolated using a growth rate which is appropriate for the long-term nature of the business.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9% has been used in discounting the projected cash ows.
The key assumption used is the sales growth rate.
This is based upon historical growth rates and future plans in the medium term.
Long term growth rates are based upon expected GDP growth, in line with IFRS 36: Impairment of Assets, rather than management expectations.
The recoverable amount of the unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.
