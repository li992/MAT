116 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 RESERVES CONTINUED In India and Bangladesh absolute title to any hydrocarbon reserves is vested in the host government.
However, under the terms of the PSCs, Cairn is entitled to receive a share of the hydrocarbon production and associated revenues.
Group reserves have therefore been presented both on a direct entitlement basis and a direct working interest basis.
The direct entitlement basis takes into account projections of government share of production calculated in accordance with certain price and expenditure assumptions.
Entitlement interest reserves are utilised for unit of production basis calculations in the financial statements.
Direct working interest basis is Cairns share of production calculated by reference to our JV participating interest as shown in the Principal Licence Interests on page 70.
For details of the booking of new reserves and the revision to existing reserves during the year, see the Operating and Financial Review on page 21.
Group reserves on an entitlement interest basis are calculated on the Groups long term oil price assumption of $30 bbl 2005: $20 bbl.
If the Groups long term oil price assumption was $40 bbl, the addition of reserves in place in the year would be 107 mbbls and the Groups total entitlement reserves at 31 December 2006 would be 180,686 mboe.
