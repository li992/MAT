Future minimum sublease payments of 16 million are expected to be received.
Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and services.
They do not include commitments for capital expenditure, which are reported in note 10 on page 90.
The increase in other commitments as at 31 December 2006 is due to outsourcing initiatives.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benets, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benets.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will turn into an obligation in the future.
The Group believes that incurred losses in any of these matters would not have a material effect.
Examples of the first type of contingent liability arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and scal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2006 was some 439 million 2005: 349 million.
This includes amounts relating to some of the legal proceedings mentioned on page 8.
Examples of the second type of contingent liability are guarantees issued by group companies.
At 31 December 2006 these amounted to some 105 million 2005: 113 million.
Included in this are discounted trade bills with a value of 23 million 2005: 25 million.
We believe that any loss arising in connection with these would not have a material effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations.
Guarantees given by parent or group companies that relate to liabilities already included in these consolidated accounts are excluded from this total.
The total value of guarantees which arose or were revised in 2006 was 41 million 2005: 39 million.
The fair value of guarantees is not material in either 2005 or 2006.
