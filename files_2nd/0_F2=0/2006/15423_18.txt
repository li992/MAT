62 TNS annual report 2006 Notes to the financial statements 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share of 8.4p 2005 11.8p have been calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent company of 37.1m 2005 52.1m and on 442.4 million shares 2005 441.6 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the EBT, which are treated as cancelled.
The diluted earnings per share of 8.2p 2005 11.6p have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of IAS 33, Earnings Per Share, with the weighted average number of shares in issue being adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares for the period they were outstanding.
Shares held by the ESOP and the EBT, which are under performance-based options, are included in the diluted weighted average number of shares, as the performance conditions are deemed to have been met for the purposes of this calculation.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the purpose of these calculations is as follows: 2006 2005 millions millions Share capital 450.7 447.4 Shares held in Treasury 3.5 Shares held by ESOP 0.2 0.4 Shares held by EBT 4.6 5.4 Basic earnings per share denominator 442.4 441.6 Dilutive effect of share options 10.4 8.3 Diluted earnings per share denominator 452.8 449.9 An adjusted earnings per share using an adjusted profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent company is also presented, as the directors believe that this assists in understanding the underlying performance of the group.

A.
On 21 December 2006 the group acquired the UK Media Intelligence business Presswatch Media Limited.
These acquisitions contributed revenues of 0.3m and operating profit of 0.1m to the group for the year to 31 December 2006.
On 31 March 2006, the group acquired a further 8% of its AISA subsidiary in the Czech Republic and on 11 July 2006 a further 12% of its subsidiaries in Russia, TNS Gallup Media and TNS MIC.
On 15 December 2006, the group acquired the remaining 25% of its subsidiary in South Africa, CEC SA.
On 15 December 2006, the group acquired control of its joint venture in Japan, TNS NRC, when that company merged with another Japanese market research business, Infoplan.
The group has a 59% interest in the combined entity, TNS Infoplan, which has been fully consolidated from the acquisition date.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2006, group revenue would have been 1,016.1m and operating profit 75.4m.
The assets and liabilities arising from the acquisitions are as follows: Carrying Provisional values pre fair value acquisition adjustments Total m m m Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 0.6 0.4 0.2 Intangible assets 0.4 0.1 0.5 1.0 0.3 0.7 Current assets Inventories 0.4 0.4 Trade and other receivables 3.9 3.9 Cash and cash equivalents 0.9 0.9 5.2 5.2 Total assets 6.2 0.3 5.9 Liabilities Trade and other payables 4.0 4.0 Minority interest in acquired net assets 0.6 0.6 Fair value of net assets acquired 1.6 0.3 1.3 Minority interests purchased 2.6 2.6 Goodwill 17.6 0.3 17.9 Consideration 21.8 21.8 Consideration satisfied by: Cash 17.0 Deferred consideration contingent 4.8 21.8 Goodwill arising on the acquisitions represents the value of assembled workforces and synergies available to the group.
All intangible assets acquired with the businesses have been recognised at their respective fair values separately from goodwill.
Each 2006 acquisition is considered to be a separate cash generating unit for the purpose of future impairment reviews except for Presswatch, which will be combined with the groups other UK Media Intelligence businesses.
Contingent deferred consideration previously recognised has been released during the year, reducing goodwill by 2.1m.
64 TNS annual report 2006 Notes to the financial statements 11 Goodwill 2006 2005 m m Cost At 1 January 407.4 386.3 Additions 15.8 5.8 Exchange adjustments 25.4 15.3 At 31 December 397.8 407.4 Aggregate impairment At 1 January 13.8 3.5 Impairment for the year 6.4 10.3 Exchange adjustments 0.5 At 31 December 19.7 13.8 Net book amount at 31 December 378.1 393.6 Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
During the year the carrying value of goodwill was tested for impairment against its value in use, based on discounted cash flow projections.
Cash flows were projected to 2009, using budgets approved by management and then extrapolated using an annual growth rate of 5% until 2011.
The following regional assumptions were used, the discount rates being based on the groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted by market-based regional risk premiums.
Pre tax Tax rate discount rate Book value %% m Germany 40.0 15.3 79.6 Rest of Europe 33.0 13.7 125.5 Americas 40.0 15.0 139.1 Other 33.9 378.1 As a result of the review, goodwill allocated to TES, a Media Intelligence business in the US, was further written down by 6.4m 2005 10.0m to nil 2005 7.4m.
This impairment arose as a result of structural changes in cinema market research and a resulting reduction in trading volume.
The pre-tax discount rate of 15.0% used in this impairment calculation was also used in the prior year estimate of value in use.
Had the tax rate or growth rate assumptions been varied within a range considered reasonably possible by management, no additional impairments would have arisen.
Had the discount rate assumption for the groups US operations been increased by 0.5%, goodwill associated with the US custom business would have been impaired by 5.1m.
The projected cash flows used in the impairment calculations are managements best estimates, but are dependent on uncertain future events.

Deferred consideration represents amounts that the group is contractually bound to pay in the future for acquisitions.
The amounts are determined by future results of the acquired businesses.
The provisions are determined with reference to the latest information available and are expected to be paid within one to three years of the balance sheet date.
Vacant property and onerous lease provisions represent the net rental cost to the group of empty leasehold properties and the net rent in excess of market rents for properties acquired with acquisitions to the end of the relevant lease periods.
The provisions are expected to be utilised by 2013.
Panel incentives represent best estimates of rewards payable in the future to panellists for their participation in panels research.
Amounts are estimated based on the value of incentives earned and are expected to be satisfied within one to two years.
Other provisions consist of liabilities arising as a result of ongoing litigation or claims, restructuring provisions excluding property of 6.8m 2005 nil and other amounts that are not individually material to the group.
The amounts are expected to be paid within one to five years.
No provisions were held by the company as at 31 December 2006 2005 nil.
22 Financial risk management and financial instruments The groups international operations and significant debt financing expose it to a range of financial risks that include changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and bank solvency credit ratings.
The group has a risk management policy to manage these financial risks over the short and medium term, to reduce volatility to earnings and shareholders funds and to aid future planning, by seeking to limit the impact of adverse movements in these variables.
The group holds foreign currency debt and uses interest rate and currency exchange rate financial instruments as part of this policy.
The board has delegated to a Financing Committee, chaired by the Finance Director, the responsibility for ensuring compliance with the groups financial risk management policy and on a semi-annual basis formally reviews this policy and its performance in delivering the boards objectives.
The group has a centralised treasury and financial risk function, which implements the risk management policy and it formally reports, on a monthly basis, the results of its activities and its compliance with the policy to the Financing Committee.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and no speculative trades are permitted or executed.
Interest rate risk On 31 December 2006, the group had liquid resources of 61.8m 2005 45.8m held at floating rates and bank borrowings of 340.2m 2005 341.2m at floating rates.
It is therefore exposed to variations in primarily UK, US and Eurozone interest rates on these financial assets and liabilities.
The group has a policy of using financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements, to ensure that the level of effective fixed rate debt after the effect of these instruments is between 55% and 75% of total net debt.
At the year end 68.0% 2005 72.7% of net debt was at effective fixed rates.
Based on debt, interest rates and hedge levels existing at 31 December 2006, a 1% rise in interest rates before the effect of the interest rate hedge would increase the future annual interest charge as follows: on USD loans 1.6m 2005 2.1m, EUR 1.5m 2005 1.2m and GBP 0.1m 72 TNS annual report 2006 Notes to the financial statements 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued 2005 0.2m.
A 1% rise in interest rates on a hedged basis would increase the annual interest charge as follows: USD 0.6m 2005 0.7m, EUR 0.5m 2005 0.6m and GBP 0.1m 2005 nil.
A 1% decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect in each case.
Currency risk The groups principal exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas earnings and net assets into sterling for accounting purposes and the sterling value of dividends paid up to the group.
The material foreign currencies in terms of earnings and net assets are the US dollar and Euro.
The group has a policy of holding a substantial amount of its bank debt in these currencies, to provide a natural hedge for currency earnings by currency interest payments and for currency net assets by the currency loan principal.
The policy ensures that the level of currency hedge debt and currency forwards where used should be greater than 75% and less than 100% of net assets for all currencies where net assets are greater than 10.0m.
The group uses forward currency contracts for hedging future certain and material dividend flows to the group.
The group does have transactional foreign exchange exposure from sales and purchases of services between members of the group.
This is hedged initially by matching cash flows through a netting process, and finally by using forward currency contracts where material.
The level of net transactional exposure is currently not considered material.
Liquidity risk The group maintains sufficient facilities, both committed and uncommitted, to finance projected working capital and general corporate needs over the medium term.
The policy ensures that total drawings from all facilities is at all times less than 80% of total committed facilities and that the average maturity profile of committed facilities is greater than 18 months at any time.
At 31 December 2006, the average maturity profile of committed facilities was 2.6 years 2005 3.6 years, and 183.8m 2005 158.7m of these facilities and 41.2m 2005 37.8m of uncommitted facilities were undrawn and available to the group.
Credit and counterparty risk The group has liquid resources deposited and financial instruments with a range of financial institutions and is therefore exposed to credit solvency risk from these institutions.
The group has a policy that defines at which institutions funds can be placed and instruments dealt, and defines credit limits based on those institutions credit ratings.
The Financing Committee is responsible for approving new counterparties on a global basis and defining these limits.
Embedded derivatives Management has a policy of not entering into contracts that involve embedded derivatives.
The group has performed a review of contracts and has concluded that no embedded derivatives exist.
Hedge accounting and hedging gains and losses Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement, except where the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The accounting treatment of derivatives classified as hedges depends on their designation.
The group designates derivatives either as a hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or commitment cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end, to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Unrealised gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Where the group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
If the group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument for net investments, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of interest rate financial instruments is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on market forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2006, there were net unrealised gains on interest rate cash flow hedges of 0.5m 2005 0.5m.
During 2006, 0.3m of losses 2005 0.6m gains on interest rate cash flow hedges were released from the cash flow hedge reserve and recognised in the interest charge.
All gains or losses on cash flow hedges were accounted for using hedge accounting.
The decrease in the fair value relating to existing and new hedges during the year was 0.1m 2005 1.1m increase.
Of the 0.5m 2005 0.5m of unrecognised gains on interest rate cash flow hedges at the end of the year, a 0.5m loss 2005 0.1m is expected to be recognised in the 2007 income statement and a 1.0m gain 2005 0.6m will be recognised in 2007.
As a central element of its risk management policy the group uses foreign currency debt to hedge its currency net assets, taking gains and losses on any residual net investment directly to reserves.
In 2006, this totalled a net loss of 10.6m 2005 6.0m gain.
All gains or losses on currency borrowings used as net investment hedges were accounted for using hedge accounting.
Net exchange gains on foreign currency debt of 26.0m 2005 13.5m losses have been taken to reserves to offset exchange losses 2005 gains on the equivalent net investment.

The assets of all funded pension plans are held separately from those of the group, and full actuarial valuations are performed at least every three years.
Contributions in 2007 are expected to be consistent with 2006 levels.
UK The pension plans in the UK are primarily defined contribution plans and the groups contribution to such plans ranges from 4% to 8% of salary, rising with the age of employees.
At 31 December there were 0.1m 2005 0.2m of outstanding contributions.
There are also two defined benefit final salary plans, which are closed to new members and future accruals.
Independent qualified actuaries performed valuations for these in 2006 and 2005 using the projected unit method, details of which are given below.
France Companies in France participate in compulsory state arrangements.
Regulations in France require that a lump sum be paid to employees on retirement, based on their final salary and the number of years service.
The provisions required to meet these amounts were assessed by independent qualified actuaries in 2006 and details of their valuations are provided below.
US The group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit final salary pension plans in the US.
At 31 December there were 0.1m 2005 0.1m of outstanding contributions in relation to the defined contribution plans.
Unfunded post retirement healthcare and life assurance plans are also operated, which at 31 December contributed 1.1m 2005 1.5m to the total US defined benefit pension obligation disclosed below.
During 2005, plan rules were changed to reduce the level of benefits available under these plans, resulting in an exceptional curtailment gain in the income statement.
All defined benefit plans, and the healthcare and life assurances plans, have been valued by independent qualified actuaries in 2006 and 2005 and details are given in aggregate below.
Netherlands The Dutch defined benefit final salary plan operated by the group is insured, although indexation increases to pensions in payment remain the responsibility of the company.
Provision for these indexation increases is made based on actuarial assessments made by independent qualified actuaries in 2006 and 2005, using the projected unit method.
An early retirement plan was also available to employees in prior years but was discontinued in 2005 following regulatory changes, resulting in another exceptional curtailment credit to the income statement.
Other countries Where there are local requirements to provide lump sum payments and other post employments benefits, provision has been made for the liabilities identified based on local actuarial assessments.
Details of these arrangements are given in aggregate in the following pages.

Additionally, all employees can elect to participate in the Worldwide Employee Share Plan WESP, which operates on a Save as You Earn basis.
For grants during 2006, the fair value was estimated using either the BlackScholes-Merton model or the Monte Carlo model and is charged to the income statement over the minimum life of the grants.
The Black-Scholes-Merton model was selected to value options and to value performance shares granted with EPS performance criteria because the grants are not complex in nature and the method is straightforward to use.
This model values such grants as if they were tradeable options and generates a single outcome using the assumptions noted below, which can then be adjusted to reflect estimates of lapsing due to non-achievement of performance criteria or employee decisions.
The Monte Carlo model was selected to value shares granted with performance criteria based on the Total Shareholder Return of TNS relative to other companies because these are market based criteria and require simulation of multiple possible outcomes to derive an estimated value.
This model values such options by simulating tens of thousands of possible outcomes for TNS and each company in the comparator group, calculating the expected gain for each simulated outcome and discounting the average of these gains to give a present value.
This valuation already includes the probability of lapsing due to non-achievement of performance criteria.
The fair values per option granted during the year and the key assumptions used are as follows: 2005 LTIP 2005 LTIP ESP KEEP WESP KEEP EPS TSR Grant date April April May October October October Valuation model BSM BSM BSM BSM BSM Monte Carlo Share price at grant date 257.0p 259.0p 261.0p 212.8p 212.8p 212.8p Exercise price 261.0p 222.2p Expected volatility based on 3 or 5 year historical volatility 32.3% 32.3% 32.3% 32.3% 32.3% 32.3% Average expected period to exercise years 4 3 5 3 3 3 Risk free rate yield on zero-coupon government bonds 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 1.6% 1.5% 1.6% 1.9% 1.9% 1.9% Fair value per share option 69.2p 247.6p 76.1p 201.0p 201.0p Monte Carlo fair value per share including probability of lapsing 91.5p The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payment plans was 5.0m 2005 4.5m, all of which related to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
