i Issued on 18 November 1996 and guaranteed by Friends Provident Life Office FPLO.
Redemption is at the option of FP Finance PLC and this was exercised on 27 November 2006.
The bonds were guaranteed on a subordinated basis by FPLO after the claims of its senior creditors, including all policyholder liabilities.
On 9 July 2001, under the Demutualisation Scheme, FPLP replaced FPLO as the guarantor.
The fair value of the bonds at 31 December 2005 was 223m.
ii Subordinated loan notes issued in December 2006 and stated net of issue costs of 2m.
The loan notes are redeemable in 2026.
For the period 20 December 2006 to 19 December 2016, interest accrues at a rate of 6.75% per annum, payable annually in arrears.
For the period 20 December 2016 to 20 December 2026, interest accrues at a rate of 2.69% above 3m LIBOR per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.
iii On 16 December 2004 FPLP raised 380m of core regulatory capital in the form of floating rate secured notes through a securitisation of the cash flows expected to emerge from a book of life insurance policies.
The total cost of funds is approximately 5.5% per annum.
The repayment of principal on the notes started on the 15 April 2006 and every year thereafter, dependent on the surplus emerging from the book of life insurance policies.
For the purpose of securitisation, two special purpose vehicles were established, namely Box Hill Life Finance plc and Box Hill Loan Finance Limited.
Both companies have been treated as Group companies for the purposes of the consolidated accounts.
On 16 December 2004 Box Hill Life Finance plc issued the two classes of floating rate secured notes.
The notes benefit from a financial guarantee provided by Ambac Assurance UK.
Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on 15 January, April, July and October each year.
In 2006, 82m of the notes were repaid.
Of the remaining 198m notes outstanding, 144m is expected to be repaid in April 2007. iv Issued in February 2005.
The carrying value is stated net of issue costs of 1m.
Convertible at the option of the holder of ordinary shares at any time on or after 21 January 2003 and up to 5 December 2007.
The number of ordinary shares to be issued on conversion will be determined by dividing the principal amount of the relevant bonds by the conversion price in effect on the relevant conversion date.
The conversion price is 1.71 per ordinary share.
Unless previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, the bonds will be redeemed on 11 December 2007 at their principal amount.
The Company may, at its option, redeem all but not some of the bonds outstanding at any time on or after 27 December 2005 and up to the final maturity date of 11 December 2007 if certain conditions are met.
Interest is payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on 11 June and December each year.
The convertible bonds are separated into a liability component, measured at amortised cost, and an embedded derivative being the option to convert to equity.
A deed poll election, effective May 2005, eliminated the Groups ability to settle conversion consideration in cash.
The embedded derivative is classified as equity and held at its fair value at May 2005.
The liability component is carried at 283m 2005: 276m.
The embedded derivative is valued at 51m and included in note 38.
