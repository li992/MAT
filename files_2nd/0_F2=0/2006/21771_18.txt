For other share schemes a Black-Scholes methodology is used to value options.
The expected volatility of share price applied in the option pricing models is based on historic Bradford & Bingley plc share price data over a period equivalent to the expected life of the scheme or since the date of flotation 4 December 2000 if shorter.
Awards granted under the Executive Incentive Plan are granted based on performance in the preceding financial year.
The performance criteria include qualitative elements which are not determined until the award date, that is, after the end of the relevant financial year.
The grant date therefore occurs after the employees to whom the award is made have begun providing services.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the grant date fair value is initially estimated for the purposes of recognising the services received during the period between service commencement date and grant date.
The fair value is then revised once the actual grant date has been established.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 4.8157 2005: 3.2722.

Issuance of these additional shares would have no material impact on the Groups earnings.
Shares acquired by employee share trusts, which are deducted from retained earnings, have been excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as they are treated as if they are cancelled until such time as they vest unconditionally to the employee.

Post-retirement benefit obligations a Pension schemes The Group operates a closed defined benefit staff pension scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Staff Pension Scheme the principal scheme, which is administered by trustees.
The funds are independent from those of the Group.
The normal pension age of employees in the schemes is 65.
The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Group Pension Plan.
The funds of this scheme are independent from those of the Group.
The Group and Company had no liabilities or prepayments associated with the defined contribution scheme at 31 December 2006 2005: nil.
The cost to the Group of the defined contribution scheme was 1.2m 2005: 1.4m and the cost to the Company was 0.9m 2005: 1.1m.
b Other post-retirement benefits The Group provides healthcare benefits to some of its pensioners.
The healthcare benefits are provided through a post-retirement medical scheme into which the Company contributes 100% towards the cost of providing medical expense benefits for members who retired before 1 January 1996 and 50% for members who retired after this date.
The total number of members of the scheme as at 31 December 2006 was 557 2005: 579.
Private medical costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
c Accounting treatment The Group accounts for post-retirement benefit costs in accordance with IAS 19 amended issued in December 2004.
The full net actuarial deficit is carried on the Group and Company Balance Sheets, and actuarial gains and losses are taken to Group and Company retained earnings rather than being charged or credited in the Income Statement.
The actuarial gain recognised in Group and Company retained earnings during the year was 20.1m 2005: loss 26.0m.
More than one employing Group entity contributes to the pension schemes.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost to individual Group entities the net defined benefit cost is recognised in the Financial Statements of the Company being the sponsoring entity while other individual Group entities, in their individual Financial Statements, recognise a cost equal to their contributions payable for the period.

Post-retirement benefit obligations continued d Employee benefit obligations continued The principal actuarial assumptions expressed as weighted averages were as follows: 2006 2005 To determine benefit obligations Discount rate at 31 December 5.1% 4.7% Future pension increases 3.1% 2.8% Rate of salary increase 5.1% 4.8% To determine the net pension cost Expected return on plan assets 5.8% 6.2% Discount rate 4.7% 5.3% Rate of salary increase 4.8% 4.8% For post-retirement medical plan Discount rate 5.1% 4.7% Inflation 3.1% 2.8% Medical cost trend for 2006 7.3% 8.0% Medical cost trend falling linearly for 2007 - 2011 7.3% to 4.5% 8.0% to 4.5% Medical cost trend from 2012 4.5% 4.5% In determining the expected long-term return on plan assets the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term return for the portfolio.
The principal assumptions made on life expectancy were for both active members and retired members to use PA92 YOB base rated up by 2 years.
As an illustration of the mortality rates used, the future life expectancies from age 60 are shown below: Male Female Non-retired members life mortality 25.9 28.7 Retired members life expectancy 23.8 26.8 based on 1965 year of birth.
Sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the pension scheme defined benefit obligation to four key assumptions: the discount rate, the rate of inflation, the rate of salary growth and the mortality assumption.
Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on Benefit Obligation Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 12.5% Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 10.9% Salary growth above inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 1.8% Mortality Decrease by 1 year Increase by 2.4% If the assumptions were to change by the same amount in the opposite direction to those illustrated, the benefit obligation would decrease by a similar percentage to those shown in the table in each case.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts recognised in staff costs.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects: 2006 2005 m m Effect on the aggregate of service cost and interest cost 0.1 0.1 Effect on defined benefit obligations 1.9 1.8 2006 2005 m m Experience adjustments on post-retirement medical plan liabilities 0.1 0.1 27.

Provisions continued Empty leasehold premises The empty leasehold premises provision relates to properties which as at the Balance Sheet date were no longer used for trading but were subject to a lease agreement.
The provision is based on either known or forecast future rental expenditure: the rental payments are due to be made during the period 2007 to 2015.
Compensation claims Compensation claims relate to potential payments to customers for business written in the past by the Groups independent advisory business.
The provision is calculated on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the size and expected timing of claims.
Notwithstanding this, external factors such as the performance of the stock market and market agitation could influence both the size and timing of payments.
Restructuring costs Other restructuring costs relate to redundancies and contract terminations which had occurred by the Balance Sheet date.
The provision represents amounts expected to be paid in 2007.
It also includes a provision for an insurance premium to cover the professional indemnity liability associated with businesses disposed of during 2004: the liability will run off over the next four years.
Pension review The pension review provision has been established to cover compensation payable in connection with phases one and two of the pension review and also a review of free-standing additional voluntary contributions.
The provision represents an estimate of the amount to be expended during 2007.

At the year end there were options outstanding over 772,222 2005: 1,463,332 shares.
Sharesave Scheme The Company operates the Bradford & Bingley 2000 Sharesave Scheme, an Inland Revenue approved, all-employee Save As You Earn share option scheme.
Grants of share options under this scheme were made as detailed in note 6.
The option prices represent a 20% discount to the market price on the date of the grant.
There were 1,406 three year and 479 five year savings contracts in place at the end of 2006 represented by a total of 2,355,725 shares under option 2005: 3,273,764.
A further invitation to participate in the scheme will be issued in February 2007.
On 8 December 2000 the Bradford & Bingley Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust was established to acquire shares for employees, including Directors, to satisfy options exercised under the Sharesave Scheme.
At 31 December 2006 the Trust held a total of 227,509 shares 2005: 1,640,490 to satisfy options which are expected to be exercised under the Sharesave Scheme.
In respect of dividends arising on the shares held, the Trust has waived its rights to all but 0.0001 pence per share.
No funds to acquire shares were provided by the Company to the Trust during 2006 2005: nil.
Employees Restricted Share Bonus Plan In April 2002 the Employees Restricted Share Bonus Plan was established to allocate shares to employees following the achievement of specified performance measures.
The shares will be released to the individuals in tranches annually in the three years following the allocation or on the third anniversary of the award, depending on the conditions under which they were awarded, and subject to them remaining employed by the Company on the anniversary dates.
At the year end there were 126,080 share allocations outstanding 2005: 223,145.
Performance Share Plan Shares were awarded under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley 2000 Performance Share Plan as detailed in note 6.
The shares will be released to the individuals after the end of the performance period subject to the achievement of a performance criterion which measures the performance of the Company against a peer group of companies.
The number of outstanding share awards at the year end was 1,034,950 2005: 2,084,082.
Executive Incentive Plan The Executive Incentive Plan 2004 was established to provide a replacement to the short and long term incentive plans for senior executives.
The short term element consists of a cash payment based on the achievement of pre-determined short term performance measures and an equivalent amount of deferred shares that are held in trust for three years.
Dividends receivable on the deferred shares are paid to the underlying beneficial owners of the shares.
After three years the long term element of the scheme may be applied in the form of an additional award of matching shares subject to earnings per share growth.
Matching share awards will be made when compound earnings per share growth is between RPI plus 3% and RPI plus 8%.
The maximum number of matching shares will be three matching shares for each deferred share.
At 31 December 2006 there were 586,088 deferred shares held in trust 2005: 341,990.

The Directors do not expect any claims to be made against the Company under these guarantees and hence no provision has been made.
Critical accounting estimates In preparation of the Groups and Companys Financial Statements, estimates are made which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities: estimates are kept under continuous evaluation.
Estimates and judgements are based on historical experience, expectations of future events and other factors.
Post-retirement benefit obligations The net deficit in respect of post-retirement benefit obligations is carried on the Balance Sheet.
The value of this obligation is calculated by the Groups actuaries using the assumptions set out in note 26.
Note 26 also discloses the sensitivity of the benefit obligations to changes in certain key assumptions.
Effective interest rate Loans and advances to customers are accounted for on an effective interest rate basis, under which the income is spread over the loans expected life.
On a quarterly basis, models are reviewed to re-assess expected life by portfolio of products, based upon actual redemptions by product.
If the estimated average life of a loan were increased or reduced by one month the Balance Sheet amount of loans and advances to customers at 31 December 2006 would be higher by 4.0m or lower by 4.0m respectively.

Critical accounting estimates continued Loan impairment The Group reviews its loan impairment on a quarterly basis.
Impairment models use historical loss experience to provide both probabilities of defaults and property forced sale discounts across a portfolio of products.
In addition, management applies a risk weighted view on additional factors, such as specific fraud cases.
If average house prices were to increase or decrease by 5% the reported impairment at 31 December 2006 would be 11.1m lower or 11.9m higher respectively.

For those transactions which qualify and are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, hedge accounting treatment is applied.
Fair value hedges are primarily used to hedge against changes in fair value of fixed rate products due to movements in market interest rates.
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group recognised fair value gains of 0.4m 2005: 1.1m, representing the ineffective portion of the fair value hedges.
Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the risk of exposure to variability of cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a forecast transaction.
The cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are closely matched by those of the cash flow hedges.
Any gains or losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in equity until the hedged cash flow occurs, whereupon they are transferred to profit or loss for the period.
As at 31 December 2006, net gains accumulated in equity were 20.6m 2005: 15.8m net of tax and the ineffective portion of those hedges was nil 2005: nil.
Hedge effectiveness is measured and assessed on an ongoing basis and was determined to be effective throughout the year and previous year.
Changes in fair values and cash flows of the hedged items were almost fully offset by changes in fair values and cash flows of the hedging instruments, and actual effectiveness was within a range of 80% to 125%.
The Group has recognised embedded derivatives within certain of its products and has classified them with derivatives in accordance with IAS 39.
Other derivatives are effective economic hedges but are not classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges under IAS 32. e Collateral The Group and Company pledge and receive collateral for repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and some derivative contracts.

f Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments The risks that the Group is exposed to and the Groups approach to risk management, are discussed in the Business Review on pages 18 to 21.
Risks are managed on a Group basis, and hence a description of risk management policies is not provided separately for the Company.
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include derivative instruments.
Such instruments are used only to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
As part of its responsibilities, the Groups Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO approves the use of specified derivative instruments within approved limits and business activities.
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes and all of the Groups derivative instruments are for commercial hedging purposes.
Hedge accounting is applied as appropriate, as detailed in the accounting policies note 1 n. The principal derivative instruments used by the Group in managing its Balance Sheet exposures are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, interest rate futures, cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures arising principally from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, fixed rate savings products, deposit funding, foreign currency exposures and investment activities.
The duration of derivative instruments is generally short-to medium-term and their maturity profile reflects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business activities.
Substantially all of the Groups derivatives activity is contracted with financial institutions.

Loans and advances to customers are secured on property.
ii Liquidity risk It should be noted that many financial instruments are settled earlier than their contractual maturity dates: in particular, many mortgage loans are repaid early.
The Group regularly measures its exposures to a range of interest rate scenarios.
Based on detailed underlying assumptions, at the end of 2006 the Group estimated the impact of a 1% fall in interest rates as an improvement in its forecast net interest income of 4.0m over the course of the following 12 months.

Financial instruments continued f Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued iii Market risk continued Interest rate risk continued A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities re-price during a given period.
Although net interest income tends to benefit from a positive gap when interest rates are rising and suffer a negative gap when rates are falling, the actual effect will depend upon a number of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date.
The carrying amounts of derivative financial instruments, which are principally used to reduce the Groups exposure to interest movements, are included under the heading non-interest bearing.
