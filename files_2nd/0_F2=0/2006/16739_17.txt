23 May 2006 Pro-forma earnings per share from continuing operations based on regulated entitlement and pre deferred tax increased by 24% to 68.2p 2005 - 55.0p, reflecting the increase in pro-forma operating profit, a lower net finance charge and a higher tax charge as well as the effect of the 9 for 10 share consolidation implemented with the return of capital.
In line with the treatment adopted in previous years and as further explained in the Summary Financial Review, pro-forma operating profit and earnings per share exclude the effect of either overor under-recovery of NIEs regulated entitlement.

This is opening costs, offset by lower price control revenues.
Based on subject to some specific reductions in 2007 08 and 2008 09 and regulated entitlement, T&D reported profits of 83.2m compared to also a small disallowance in respect of early retirement pension 73.9m last year.

This change 326m in RP4 compared to 257m in the current price control resulted in a reduction of 4.5m in T&Ds depreciation charge from period both figures in 2004 05 prices.
This investment is driven by what it otherwise would have been.
Profits also benefited from the need to replace worn assets and to meet continued growth in reductions in operating costs and the absence of certain customer demand.
These proposals have been the subject of review restructuring and reorganisation costs incurred last year.
In during the early part of 2006 by consultants appointed by NIAER.
particular, cost savings were achieved as a result of centralising customer call handling at our distribution control centre in Craigavon: this included the transfer to T&D of some services previously provided by Sx3.
Cost efficiencies also resulted from a lower headcount.

Energia is growing its customer base to absorb the future output of Huntstown 2.
Powerteam Powerteam made steady progress during the year increasing its As indicated in the interim results, Energia has experienced pressure profits to 4.6m 2005 - 3.8m due to an increase in internal on operating margins following the setting of electricity tariffs by CER income and improved margins: its main focus continues to be on in the RoI for calendar year 2006, against a background of high gas costs to T&D.

and overhead line and substation contracts in Great Britain.
Group Chief Executives Review 5 We are making an active input into CERs current consultations on the appropriate level of RoI tariffs for calendar year 2007.
These tariffs, which are published by ESB following agreement with CER, set the benchmark for contracts between suppliers such as Energia and customers participating in the competitive market.
We expect the process to be challenging, given the level of forward gas prices for winter 2006 07 and the planned introduction of the SEM halfway through the tariff year.
We expect tariff proposals for the first six months of 2007 to be issued at the beginning of September followed by a final announcement in early October.
During the year, Energia started to supply a number of large customers in the RoI with gas, generating revenues of 11m 14m therms : annualised volume is c23m therms.
Renewable energy Since 1 April 2005, suppliers in Northern Ireland have been required to source a proportion of their supply from renewable generation.
Energia currently has 33MW of windfarm capacity under contract and is aiming to negotiate further contracts with windfarm developers, either as offtake arrangements, or through direct investment where projected returns are appropriate.
Windfarm development in Northern Ireland has been slower than expected as a result of planning delays.
In April 2005 the RoI government announced details of a new support mechanism for renewable energy.
Under the mechanism, renewable generators will contract with suppliers at a fixed price and suppliers will benefit from support payments levied across all customers.
Energia is assessing offtake contracts with windfarm developers under this scheme, which only received final approval on 2 May 2006.
Other Activities Other profits of 3.9m 2005 - 2.5m benefited from the disposal of property.
We do not anticipate any further significant property disposals.

Summary Financial Review 7 Net Pension Liability The net pension liability, net of deferred tax, in the Groups defined benefit scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, decreased to 72.0m at 31 March 2006 from 112.8m at 31 March 2005 reflecting the special pension contribution of 25.0m 17.5m net of tax made in July 2005 and a net actuarial gain of 31.5m 22.0m net of tax.
Notwithstanding the improvement in the net pension liability under IAS 19, the Group has decided to increase its cash contributions in respect of the past service liability from 6m per annum to 10m per annum.
It also intends to make an additional special contribution of 10m during 2006 07.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme at 31 March 2006 is underway and final results will be available later in the year.
Return of Capital The return of capital to shareholders and the associated 9 for 10 share capital consolidation, announced in conjunction with the disposal of Sx3, were successfully effected through a B share scheme in August 2005.
