Foodservice Group Notes to the accounts The directors report is on pages 20 to 23 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and the Companies Act 1985.
A consolidated Group cash flow statement has been included in the Aga Foodservice Group plc consolidated accounts: the Company has therefore taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 not to produce a cash flow statement.
Pension costs The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the periods benefiting from the employees services in accordance with FRS 17.
Financial instruments Financial assets are recognised when the company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity investments: or as available-forsale financial assets, as appropriate.
Derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the company becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance revenue and finance cost.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging Where appropriate, the Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective at inception.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, a hedge is classified as: a fair value hedge, i. e. a hedge of the fair value of an asset or a liability, a cash flow hedge, i. e. a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Annual Report and Accounts 2006 74 75 1.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued profit and loss account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges such as forward currency contracts are recognised in equity, to the extent that the hedges are effective.
Any ineffective portion is recognised as a profit or loss.
Amounts deferred in equity are released when the forecast hedged transaction impacts profit and loss.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies The Companys functional currency and the presentation currency is pounds sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account, except when hedge accounting is applied.
These are taken directly to reserves until the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss, at which time they are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences, using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Income tax is provided for using current rates.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost and reviewed for impairment annually and when there are indicators that suggest the amount might not be recoverable.
Provisions The Companys other provisions relate to the remaining costs in respect of the disposal of Pipe Systems, including probable warranty and indemnity claims, other claims and other costs from third parties in relation to divested businesses.
