The directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps sufficient accounting records to disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and, in that context, to have proper regard to the establishment of appropriate systems of internal control with a view to the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are required to prepare financial statements and to provide the auditors with every opportunity to take whatever steps and undertake whatever inspections the auditors consider to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit report.
The directors consider that they have pursued the actions necessary to meet their responsibilities as set out in this statement.
