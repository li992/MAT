NOTES 35-48 RELATE TO THE COMPANY Notes to 35.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES the Accounts The Company accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards.
The accounting continued policies are in line with the relevant Group accounting policies detailed in note 1 except for the following: A.
INCOME TAX Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided, without discounting, on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except for those which should not be recognised under FRS 19, calculated at the enacted rates at which it is estimated that tax will be payable.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at year-end rates of exchange.
C. RETIREMENT BENEFITS The defined benefit scheme covers several companies in the Group and it is not possible to identify the share of assets and liabilities relating to individual companies.
Consequently in the Company the pension scheme is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
Amounts charged to profits represent the contribution payable to the scheme in the period.
