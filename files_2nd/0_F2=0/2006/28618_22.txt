Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies Rathbone Brothers Plc is a public company incorporated in the UK.
The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its individual accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UK UK GAAP : these are presented on pages 96 to 105.
At the date of approval of these accounts, IFRS 7: Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures, which have been endorsed by the EU and which are relevant to the Groups operations but which have not been applied in preparing these accounts, were in issue but not yet effective.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of this Standard and the related amendment to IAS 1, which come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007, will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments.
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006 or later periods but that the Group has not early adopted: IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
IFRIC 8 requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
The Group will apply IFRIC 8 from 1 January 2007, but it is not expected to have any material impact on the Groups accounts: and IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
IFRIC 10 prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill, investments in equity instruments and investments in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date.
The Group will apply IFRIC 10 from 1 January 2007, but it is not expected to have any material impact on the Groups accounts.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures During the year, the Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that relate to financial guarantees.
In accordance with IAS 39, financial guarantees issued by the Group are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the contract.
Adoption of the amendments did not have a material impact on the reported results or position of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2006.
Comparative figures have therefore not been restated.
The comparative figures in the cash flow statement have been restated to show separately interest paid and received.
Basis of presentation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below, and, unless otherwise stated, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated accounts.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefit from the entities activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Rathbone International Finance BV, which is effectively controlled by the Company, although the Company does not own any of the entitys share capital.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
62 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group considers the carrying amounts of its assets with finite lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the higher of fair value less any cost to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
The recoverable amount of held to maturity investment securities and loans and receivables is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset on recognition.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss excluding goodwill subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
An impairment loss in respect of a held to maturity security or loans and receivables is reversed if the subsequent increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in equity instruments classified as available for sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment is reversed through profit or loss.
Interest income and expenses Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost and for available for sale financial instruments using the effective interest method.
Interest payable and receivable on derivative financial instruments is included within net interest income.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and interest paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
63 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Fees and commissions Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised over the period the service is provided.
Asset management fees are recognised rateably over the period the service is provided.
Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned.
To the extent that retained initial charge income received on the sale of units arises from an identifiable brokerage service, the income is recognised on the performance of that service.
Other retained initial charges are deferred and recognised as income on a straight line basis over the estimated average life of the unit holding.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: Leasehold land and buildings: over the lease term Plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to five years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when other occasions or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to groups of cash generating units that correspond with the Groups segments, as these represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitor goodwill for purposes of impairment testing.
Cash generating units are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of unamortised goodwill, which has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
b Computer software and software development costs Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised on the basis of the expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
c Client relationships Client lists acquired are shown at historical cost.
Those in respect of business combinations are initially recognised at fair value.
Client relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the client relationships over their estimated useful lives 7 15 years.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification of financial assets is determined at initial recognition.
64 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan with no intention of trading the receivable.
c Held-to-maturity Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than those that meet the definition of loans and receivables or that the Group has classified as available for sale or fair value through profit or loss.
d Available-for-sale Available-for-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are recognised on trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or been effectively transferred, or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity except for changes arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which are recognised as income or expenditure in the income statement for monetary assets and directly in equity for non-monetary assets, until the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity should be recognised in the income statement.
However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Work in progress Trust work in progress is included within other assets and is valued at the expected recoverable amount, including an appropriate portion of profit, calculated by reference to the stage of completion of the service rendered.
The corresponding income is recognised within fees and commissions receivable.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring which has been notified to affected parties.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the relevant group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary financial assets carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
65 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Foreign currencies continued Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the Groups presentational currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in equity within the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the Groups translation reserve.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments denominated in a currency other than the Groups functional currency arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as non-monetary foreign currency items and they are translated using the exchange rate applied on the date of acquisition.
Retirement benefit costs The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of profit and loss and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the amended benefits become vested.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or negative goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
66 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI Cash and cash equivalents continued For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees.
The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
Except for those which include terms related to market conditions, vesting conditions included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or share options.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market related vesting condition is met, provided that the non-market vesting conditions are met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Direct costs are allocated to the segment that generated the cost.
Indirect costs are allocated to reporting segments so as to reflect the proportion of the cost that each segment has generated, on a pro rata basis.
Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Such monies and the corresponding liability to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group makes estimates about a range of long term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the Groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 10,763,000 are given in note 27.
Long term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be significantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the Group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The history of experience adjustments is set out in note 27.
Income recognition Revenue in the Trust and Tax business is calculated by reference to the estimated stage of completion of the service rendered.
Estimates are also made as to the recoverability of work in progress and debtors in relation to this income.
At the year end, total work in progress and debtors for trust and pension services amounted to 11,372,000 2005: 10,753,000.
Conversely, very little judgement is required in the recognition of income arising from the Investment Management and Unit Trusts businesses, due to the close proximity of billing dates to the year end and the inherently non-judgmental nature of interest accrual calculations.
67 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued Share based payments In determining the fair value of equity settled share based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes assumptions about future events and market conditions.
In particular, judgements must be formed as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the fair value of each award granted.
The fair value of awards is determined using a valuation model which is dependent on further estimates, including the Groups future dividend policy, employee turnover, the timing with which options will be exercised and future volatility in the price of the Groups shares.
Such assumptions are based on publicly available information where available and reflect market expectations and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
Different assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could materially affect the reported value of share based payments.
The assumptions used at the year end are set out in note 28.
Impairment of goodwill The Group makes estimates in relation to the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated in determining whether goodwill is impaired.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 69,965,000.
The assumptions underlying the value in use calculation are set out in note 18.
There has been no impairment of goodwill in prior years.
3 Segmental information a Business segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions: Investment Management, Unit Trusts and Trust and Tax.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Transactions between the business segments are on normal commercial terms and conditions.
Intra-segment income constitutes trail commission.
Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction.
Centrally incurred expenses are allocated to business segments on an appropriate pro-rata basis.
Segment assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and liabilities, being the majority of the balance sheet, but exclude items such as taxation and borrowings.

A. London Branch.
The business was transferred to Rathbone Investment Management Limited, a principal subsidiary of the Company, by way of a Court order sanctioning a banking business transfer scheme pursuant to Part VII of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

27 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to this scheme during the year was 594,000 2005: 370,000.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 517,000 2005: 450,000.
The Group operates two pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for executive directors and staff employed by the Company the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management Limited, with investments managed on a discretionary basis.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The scheme operated by Rathbone Stockbrokers Limited the Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future pension accrual for the current membership with effect from 1 October 1999.
As from that date all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
Both schemes continue on a closed basis with the existing assets remaining invested thereunder.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries every three years using the projected unit credit method which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to date of termination of services.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at: Last full actuarial valuation as at: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2004 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2002 The actuarial valuation of the Laurence Keen Scheme as at 31 December 2005 is in progress but has not yet been completed.
Consideration has been given to the preliminary results of that valuation in preparing these financial statements.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Laurence Laurence Rathbone Rathbone Keen Keen 1987 1987 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Rate of increase in salaries 4.15% 4.05% 4.15% 4.05% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.50% 2.80% 2.90% 2.80% Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.90% 2.80% 2.90% 2.80% Discount rate 5.20% 4.90% 5.20% 4.90% Expected return on scheme assets 6.21% 5.99% 7.09% 7.06% Inflation assumption 2.90% 2.80% 2.90% 2.80% 5% for service prior to April 2001 The overall expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average of the returns expected on each class of asset held by the scheme, as disclosed below.
Normal retirement age is 65 for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme and 60 for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.

The Group enters into contracts involving financial instruments during the normal course of its business.
Such financial instruments, which are primarily term deposits and certificates of deposit, are not held for trading purposes.
In addition, certain financial instruments such as settlement debtors and creditors arise directly from the Groups operations.
The Group also makes use of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk see note 23.
The Groups overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the board of directors.
The Treasury Department, reporting through the Banking Committee to the Board, has principal responsibility for investing surplus liquidity and for monitoring exposure to market risk which includes interest rate risk and currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
All procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group Treasury Manual, and policy documents are in place to cover the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
Operational, reputational and legal risks are actively monitored by the Risk Management Committee which works with divisional management to identify and grade the different risks to which the business and support areas are exposed.
Active steps are taken to mitigate or control risks wherever practicable.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk is addressed by managing the mismatch between the Groups interest bearing and non-interest bearing assets and liabilities.
The Groups interest rate exposure is broadly reflected in the interest rate repricing table below.
The table shows the consolidated repricing profile of the Groups assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, as at the year end and therefore provides an indication of the sensitivity of the Groups earnings to interest rate movements.
Also shown are the weighted average effective interest rates for interest bearing monetary financial instruments at the year end.
The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to 88 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI repricing of the interest bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest bearing assets.
At 31 December 2006, Rathbone Investment Management Limited had 626 million 2005: 464.9 million of sterling liabilities averaging 4 days 2005: 8 days to repricing which were matched by sterling assets averaging 96 days 2005: 65 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 92 days 2005: 57 days.
This represented a total potential profit or loss of 1,579,000 2005: 726,000 at 31 December for a 1% decrease or increase in interest rates.
The impact of the groups forward rate agreements is to reduce this exposure by 275,000 2005: 25,000.
Currency risk The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The Group is also subject to a structural currency exposure on its net investments in overseas subsidiaries primarily in Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange risk at 31 December.
Included in the table are the Groups assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.

Significant changes in the economy or in the health of a particular sector could result in losses that are different from those that the Group has provided for at the balance sheet date.
The Group structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to borrowers or groups of borrowers and to geographical and industry segments.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from banking clients with a range of high quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are fully secured against clients assets that are held by Group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through regular analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations and by changing the lending limits where appropriate.
Liquidity risk The Treasury Department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Groups liquidity policy, which requires that the Bank maintains a surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met.
Liquidity mismatches are monitored on a daily basis against the liquidity limits set by the Banking Committee and the FSAs liquidity mismatch guidelines.
Liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to contractual maturity date.

31 Contingent liabilities and commitments a The Group is currently carrying out a review of its Rathbone Self Invested Personal Pension Rathbone SIPP business.
The principal aim of the review is to ascertain whether any of the Rathbone SIPPs arranged for clients were unsuitable.

To date, the review has identified a small number of cases involving the transfer of clients existing pension policies into Rathbone SIPPs where the case files do not contain conclusive evidence of suitability and a provision has been made in relation to these see note 26.
There remains 1 case requiring further investigation and, at this stage, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, financial effect there will be for the Group in respect of that remaining case.
