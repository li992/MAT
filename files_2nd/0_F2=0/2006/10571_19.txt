The directors consider the fair value not to be materially different to the carrying value for financial instruments.
The Company holds part of its cash as sterling deposits with counterparties, which are at a fixed rate based on LIBOR and for periods not exceeding three months.
The objective of placing these deposits with financial institutions approved by the Board is to maximise interest received.
By placing surplus funds with approved counterparties the Companys risk profile is not significantly changed from maintaining funds with the Companys clearing bank.
There are no amounts included within cash at bank and in hand 2005: nil which is not accessible within 24 hours without penalty.
During the year under review the Company did not enter into derivative transactions and has not undertaken trading in any financial instruments.

8 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution scheme The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefits Plan the Plan was established on 31 May 1995 and operates on defined contribution principles for employees of the Group.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the Trustees of the Plan.
The total cost charged to income of 4.8m 2005: 4.7m represents contributions payable to the defined contribution section of the Plan by the Group at rates specified in the Plan rules.
As at 31 December 2006, contributions of 0.4m 2005: 0.4m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the Plan.
Defined benefits scheme The Plan includes some defined benefit liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued benefit rights of former active and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group.
These include final salary related benefits for members in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995.
No further defined benefit membership rights can accrue after that date.
Under the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits at a retirement age of 65.
No other retirement benefits are provided.
The Plan is currently being funded.
The last triennial valuation of the Plan was undertaken on 5 April 2004 and was prepared using assumptions of a rate of investment return of 6.0% per annum, a rate of earnings escalation of 4.0% per annum and rate of inflation of 2.5% per annum.
The ongoing liabilities of the Plan were assessed using the projected unit method whereas the assets were taken at realisable market value.
The actuarial valuation referred to showed that the defined benefit liabilities were partly funded and, on an ongoing basis, the value of the assets of 3.9m represented 64% of the value of these liabilities.
The actuarial valuation also showed that the realisable market value of the Plans assets was 81% of its minimum liabilities when assessed on the Minimum Funding Requirement basis as defined in the Pensions Act 1995.
The next triennial valuation will be carried out as at 5 April 2007 when the funding position will be re-appraised.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liabilities was as at 31 December 2006.
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit method.
