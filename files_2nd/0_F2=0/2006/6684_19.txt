NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
They have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice.
The company prepares its financial statements on the historic cost basis of accounting as modied by the revaluation of certain tangible xed assets.
No profit and loss account is presented by the company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the company has taken the exemptions under FRS1 to not present a cash ow statement.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption for disclosure available to parent companies under FRS25 Financial Instruments and FRS13 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments for 2006 and 2005 respectively.
Changes in accounting policy Post balance sheet events In accordance with FRS21, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the company now recognises dividends in the period they are declared.
The prior year comparatives have been restated to comply with FRS21 resulting in an increase in net assets and reserves of 13.7m at 3 July 2004 and a further 2.9m at 2 July 2005.
Share based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions in the standard, FRS20, Share-based Payments, has been applied to all grants made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 3 July 2005.
This has not had a significant impact on the operating profits in the current or prior year.
Financial instruments In accordance with the transitional provisions in the standards, FRS25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS26, Financial Instruments: Measurement, have been adopted from 3 July 2005.
Under the previous UK GAAP accounting policies, gains and losses from derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes were not recognised in earnings or as adjustments to carrying value until the underlying hedged transaction matured or occurred.
FRS26 requires all derivatives to be fair valued in the balance sheet.
As a result, net assets and reserves have been increased by 0.3m at 3 July 2005.
Pensions The company has adopted FRS17, Retirement Benets, in the year.
With the exception of the removal of SSAP24 accounting balances, this has had no impact on the company which treats both its pension schemes as dened contribution schemes see note 7.
The removal of the SSAP24 prepayment and the related deferred tax has decreased net assets and reserves at 2 July 2005 by 23.6m and decreased profit for the prior year by 18.1m 2004 decrease in net assets 5.5m.
Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
The transitional arrangements of FRS15 have been adopted for properties which permit the previous valuation performed as at 27 June 1998 to be retained.
Other xed assets are shown at historic cost.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost or valuation of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings over 10 to 100 years Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease Plant and equipment over 3 to 15 years Land is not depreciated.
The maximum estimated useful economic life in respect of freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings was increased from 50 to 100 years in the current year.
The effect of this change was immaterial.
At each balance sheet date the company reviews the carrying amount of its tangible assets to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
If indicators of impairment exist then the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the difference is recognised in the profit and loss account as an impairment loss.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension benets The company is a member of the Go-Ahead Group Pension Scheme operated by The Go-Ahead Group plc for the majority of its employees.
The schemes are multi-employer schemes for which individual employer asset shares cannot be identied and accordingly the company accounts for them as dened contribution schemes.
For the dened contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benets is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share-based payments The company operates equity-settled share option schemes under which options have been granted to employees including directors.
The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS20 and has applied FRS20 only to options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 3 July 2005.
The cost of options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, determined by an external valuation using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled options, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc market conditions.
The cost of options is recognised in the income statement over the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised, at each reporting date, reects the extent to which the period to vesting has expired and the directors best estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
64 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 1 PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, no timing differences are recognised in respect of: property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to sell the asset: gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into replacement assets: deferred tax assets except to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted rates at which it is estimated the tax will be payable.
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
Uninsured liabilities The group limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties.
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits.
An accrual is made within current liabilities for the estimated cost to the company to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
On the basis that the group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date, these uninsured liabilities are classied as current.
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is made after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the group.
Treasury shares Reacquired shares in the company, which remain uncancelled, are deducted from equity.
Consideration paid and the associated costs are also recognised in shareholders funds as a separate reserve for own shares.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the groups shares is transferred from the reserve for own shares to revenue reserves.
Financial assets Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with FRS26.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The company has not restated comparative amounts on first applying FRS25 and FRS26.
The company uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated with fuel price uctuations.
Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments, and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows, are recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
When the cash ow hedge results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-financial asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the profit and loss account as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or otherwise no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the profit and loss account or included in the initial carrying amount of the related non-financial asset as described above.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss account.
Prior to 3 July 2005, the accounting policy was that any energy derivatives were not revalued to fair value or included in the companys balance sheet at the year end.
Leasing commitments Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortisation of liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or other derecognition of debt, are recognised directly in the profit and loss account.

Some of the freehold and leasehold properties occupied by the company were valued by Knight Frank external valuers, as at 27 June 1998, on the basis of existing use value.
Whilst the group accounting policy under IFRS is to carry their xed assets at valuation, the company continues to carry land and buildings at historic revalued amounts or cost.
If the valuation had not taken place the historic cost and accumulated depreciation would have been: 2006 2005 m m Cost Freehold land and buildings 63.9 52.0 Leasehold property 3.4 1.8 67.3 53.8 Accumulated depreciation Freehold land and buildings 4.4 3.9 Leasehold property 0.8 0.7 5.2 4.6 The net book value of leasehold properties comprises: 2006 2005 m m Leases with 50 or more years unexpired 0.4 0.5 3 FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS Shares in group Loans to group companies companies Total m m m Cost or valuation: At 2 July 2005 171.1 82.2 253.3 Additions 2.5 2.5 At 1 July 2006 173.6 82.2 255.8 Provisions: At 2 July 2005 At 1 July 2006 Net carrying amount: At 1 July 2006 173.6 82.2 255.8 At 2 July 2005 171.1 82.2 253.3 For details of the principal operating subsidiary undertakings as at 1 July 2006, refer to note 21 of The Go-Ahead Group plc consolidated financial statements.

The company has no security over its liabilities.
Certain of the companys borrowings are 364 day revolving facilities with a one year term out option in favour of the company.
The classication of these borrowings as due in more than one year assumes that the term out options will be exercised.
The prior year balances have been similarly reclassied from current liabilities to non current liabilities.
6 DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred tax m At 2 July 2005 restated 4.7 Provided during the year 2.5 At 1 July 2006 2.2 Deferred taxation provided at 30% is as follows: 2005 2006 restated m m Capital allowances in advance of depreciation 1.6 1.2 Other timing differences 3.8 5.9 2.2 4.7 67 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 7 PENSION COMMITMENTS The company participates in The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan The Go-Ahead Plan, which consists of a funded dened benefit section and a dened contribution section as follows: The dened contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants.
The expense recognised for the dened contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is the contributions paid.
The dened benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benets based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
The last formal valuation of the Plan was performed at 5 April 2003 by a professionally qualied actuary.
The next formal valuation is due to be made as at 5 April 2006.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The company has paid contributions to its pension arrangements in line with the contribution schedules in force over the accounting year.
The contributions paid to the dened benefit scheme were 7% and 6% of Pensionable Salaries to the Upper and Lower tier sections respectively.
Employer contributions to The Go-Ahead Plan are affected by any surplus or deficit in the scheme.
However, as all the participating companies, including the parent company, pay the same net rate of contributions, the actuarial risks are shared and no participating company is able to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Accordingly, the company accounts for its participation in the plan as contributions are payable and provides the following information on the deficit for the scheme as a whole.
