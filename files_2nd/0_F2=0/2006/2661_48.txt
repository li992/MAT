At the year end there were Group companies registered in Gibraltar, India, the UK, Alderney, Bulgaria, Bermuda and Antigua.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of e-commerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in these financial statements.
In calculating the tax provision, in addition to any amounts due in respect of jurisdictions in which Group companies are currently incorporated or domiciled, a provision has been made to cover the Directors best estimate of additional taxation exposures which may arise.
Where the actual outcome differs from the amounts originally recorded, the tax and deferred tax provisions will be affected in the period s in which the determination is made.
The Group has received indemnities from the Principal Shareholders in connection with certain potential historic corporate taxation liabilities.
The Directors consider the likelihood of any such liability arising to be remote.
Accordingly, neither has a provision for any such potential taxation been made, nor has an asset been recognised in respect of the indemnity.
c Factors that may affect future tax charges In Gibraltar, the Group benefits from the exempt company regime.
The Gibraltar exempt company regime will be phased out between 1 July 2006 and 31 December 2010: under current rules, assessable income is taxed in Gibraltar at 35.0%.
In India, the Group benefits from a tax holiday on income from qualifying activities until March 2009: under current rules assessable income is taxed in India at approximately 36.7%.
