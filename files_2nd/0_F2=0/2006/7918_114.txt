The expected 471m contribution to the defined benefit pension plans includes 274m to the ICI UK Pension Fund and 110m to the ICI UK Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
Investment policies and strategies ICI has established a set of best practice principles for pension fund investment so as to ensure a globally consistent approach.
These principles, which have been determined and adopted by the fiduciaries of ICIs pension funds worldwide, include guidelines in the areas of governance, risk budgeting, strategic asset allocation and benchmarks, manager structure and selection, monitoring and other investment issues such as derivatives and self investment.
The over-arching principle clearly states that strategic asset allocation should be determined through explicit consideration of each plans specific liability profile and funding level and not by local common practice.
Furthermore, all plans must establish a strategic asset allocation benchmark, a relevant total plan performance benchmark and a process for controlling deviations from the strategic asset allocation benchmark.
Pension funds are expected to invest in a diversified range of asset classes and investment managers.
These assets may include derivatives up to a maximum of 10% of the individual fund unless a higher percentage is agreed after consultation with the Company.
However, no self-investment is permitted.
Whilst the Company expects to be consulted on these strategic and other matters, it recognises that final responsibility for establishing investment strategy often rests with local fiduciaries, who do not publish target allocations to asset classes.

com Accounts 27 Reconciliation of changes in equity continued As noted in the basis of presentation on page 69, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease came into effect from 1 January 2006.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, this has resulted in additional assets of 15m being recognised on the balance sheet at 1 January 2004, offset by the recognition of associated finance lease creditors of 19m.
As a result, equity as at 1 January 2004 was restated from 572 m to 576 m. As noted in the basis of preparation on page 70, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement came into effect on 1 January 2005 and the Group took the exemption not to restate comparatives.
As a result of these standards, a number of financial instruments were recognised or revalued in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005 decreasing reserves by 63m.
The own shares that the Group had acquired, or was committed to acquire under forward contracts, to hedge its obligations under various share option schemes, were included in treasury stock under IAS 32 and debited to reserves on transition.
This was partly offset by the release of a provision held under UK GAAP relating to the same liability, resulting in a debit of 56m to reserves.
Interest rate swaps and loans previously held at carrying value were restated to fair value on transition resulting in an additional net debit to reserves of 6m.
There was also a further 1m debit arising from the inclusion of corn futures in the National Starch business.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Associate reserve The associate reserve comprises profits less losses of the Groups associated undertakings see note 15.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include net profit and loss for the year and the reserves relating to own shares.
Own shares relate to 2.5 million 2005 4.3 million shares of the Company held by the Imperial Chemical Industries PLC Employee Benefit Trust which are under option to, or conditionally gifted to, employees under the arrangements described in note 7.
The deduction in reserves is 14m 2005 27m and the shares have a market value at 31 December 2006 of 11m 2005 14m.

Limitation of borrowings The Articles of Association of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC state that borrowings after deducting cash, current asset investments and short-term deposits must not exceed two and a half times the shareholders equity after adding back sums, calculated in accordance with US GAAP, equivalent to the unamortised balance of goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 January 1985, which had been written off against reserves under UK accounting practice.
Any borrowings, cash or short-term investments held by subsidiaries in their capacity as trustee of a Group pension fund are excluded from the calculation.
For the purposes of calculating the basis of the borrowings limits, in accordance with the Articles of Association, the total of the sums standing to the credit of capital and revenue reserves of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, to be added to the nominal amount of the share capital of the Company, was 1,245m at 31 December 2006 2005 930m.
The Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire under forward contracts, 25.6 million shares or ADSs of the Company to hedge its obligations under the Senior Staff and Executive Share Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the Performance Growth Plan and the Performance Share Plan.
2.5 million shares purchased in the market are held by a trust.
In addition, the trust has entered into forward commitments to purchase 23.1 million shares at a weighted average cost of 4.43 per share total balance sheet liability of 102m in 2007, although the trust has the option to roll forward these commitments for further periods if required.
These forward commitments include collateral requirements related to the prevailing share price of the Company.
At 31 December 2006, no collateral is posted with the counterparties to these transactions.
The contracts include the right to either take delivery of shares or to net settle the contracts in cash.
On 19 January 2007, the Group settled its forward commitments and took delivery of 23.1m shares with a total cash outflow of 126m 102m relating to the cost and 24m relating to the accrued finance charges.
These shares are intended to satisfy requirements for share awards and share options exercisable in the period 2007 to 2016. www.
