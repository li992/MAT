Fair values are determined according to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, except in the case of share awards under the PRP and ESOP schemes which contain performance conditions based on total shareholder return compared to other entities in the Media and Entertainment sector.
These schemes are valued by external experts using a Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model.
