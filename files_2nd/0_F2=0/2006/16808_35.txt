At 31 March 2006, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring within 5 years Unlimited Total m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 11,451 1,452 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 172 31,331 31,503 173 32,782 32,955 Included above are losses amounting to 1,939 million 2005: 1,870 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The losses above also include 27,545 million 2005 20,898 million that have arisen in overseas holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
Since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
In addition to the losses described above, the Group has potential tax losses of 35,250 million 2005: 34,674 million in respect of a write down in the value of investments in Germany.
These losses have to date been denied by the German tax authorities.
Vodafone is in continuing discussions with them regarding the availability of the losses, however the outcome of these discussions and the timing of the resolution are not yet known.
The Group has not recognised the availability of the losses, nor the income statement benefit arising from them, due to this uncertainty.
If upon resolution a benefit is recognised, it may impact both the amount of current income taxes provided since the date of initial deduction and the amount of the benefit from tax losses the Group will recognise.
The recognition of these benefits could affect the overall profitability of the Group in future periods.
The Group holds provisions in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 23,038 million 2005: 15,060 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
