48 Smiths Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Statement of directors responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at the end of the year, and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those accounts, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state that the consolidated financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards, and the Parent Company Financial Statements comply with UK GAAP: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts: and prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention of fraud and other irregularities.
