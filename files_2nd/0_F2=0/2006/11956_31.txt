17 Financial instruments and derivatives Financial risk management Treasury policy and procedures Group treasury matters are managed within policy guidelines set by the Board with prime areas of focus being liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange exposure.
Management of these areas is the responsibility of the groups central treasury function.
Derivative financial instruments are utilised to reduce exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The Board does not permit the speculative use of derivatives.
Funding and liquidity management The group is financed primarily by loan notes, bank loans, vehicle stocking credit lines and operating cash flow.
Committed facilities have a range of maturities, are maintained at levels in excess of planned requirements and are in addition to short term uncommitted facilities that are also available to the group.
Each business within the group is responsible for its own day to day cash management and the overall cash position is monitored on a daily basis by the group treasury department.
Where our overseas subsidiaries borrow to fund their businesses they do so independently of and without recourse to the UK parent company.
Interest rate risk management The objective of the groups interest rate policy is to minimise interest costs whilst protecting the group from adverse movements in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash-flow interest rate risk whereas borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
The group does not actively manage cash flow interest rate risk as the Board believes that the retail sector in which the group operates provides a natural hedge against interest rate movements.
Consequently, it is group policy to borrow on a floating rate basis and all fair value interest rate risk arising from fixed rate borrowings entered into by the group are managed by swaps into floating rate.
60 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17 Financial instruments and derivatives continued Foreign exchange risk management The group faces currency risk in respect of its net assets denominated in currencies other than sterling.
On translation into sterling movements in currency will affect the value of these assets.
The groups policy is therefore to match, where possible, net assets in overseas subsidiaries which are denominated in a foreign currency with borrowings in the same currency.
Similarly, where the group borrows in a foreign currency to finance assets denominated in sterling the borrowings are swapped into sterling.
In line with these policies the group has swapped all of its fixed rate loan notes denominated in US dollars into floating rate sterling and has borrowed Euro 10.0m 2005 : Euro 17.0m and USD 49.0m 2005 : USD 46.0m against its net assets held in overseas subsidiaries.
Credit risk management The group is exposed to credit risk primarily in respect of its trade receivables and financial assets.
Trade receivables are stated net of provision for estimated doubtful receivables.
Exposure to credit risk in respect of trade receivables is mitigated by the group's policy of only granting credit to certain customers after an appropiate evaluation of credit risk.
Credit risk arises in respect of amounts due from manufacturers in relation to bonuses and warranty receivables.
This risk is mitigated by the range of manufacturers dealt with, the group's procedures in effecting timely collection of amounts due and management's belief that it does not expect any manufacturer to fail to meet its obligations.
Financial assets comprise cash balances and assets arising from transactions involving derivative financial instruments.
The counterparties are banks with sound credit ratings and management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge currency and interest risks arising from its activities.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities, any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is also stated, separately from the derivative, at fair value in respect of the risk being hedged with any gain or loss also recognised in the income statement.
This will result in variations in the balance sheet values of the hedged item and the offsetting derivatives as the market value fluctuates.
The fair value of derivatives and hedged items is the estimated amount receivable or payable to terminate the contract determined by reference to calculations provided by financial institutions utilising market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Hedges Fair value hedges of interest rate and currency risk The group classifies its interest rate and currency swaps as fair value hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps at 1 January 2005 was adjusted against opening retained earnings.
The net fair value of swaps used as hedges of the group's USD and GBP loan notes is set out below: Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities carrying carrying carrying carrying value & value & value & value & fair value fair value fair value fair value 2006 2006 2005 2005 Fair value hedge m m m m Currency and interest swap USD 110m GBP : fixed rate to floating rate expiring 2011 - 4.8 3.4 - Currency and interest swap USD 67m GBP : fixed rate to floating rate expiring 2014 - 2.9 2.5 - Interest swap GBP 17m : fixed rate to floating rate expiring 2014 - 0.3 0.6 - Total - 8.0 6.5 - All derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities are non-current.
The critical terms of the derivative financial instrument and the hedged item match i. e. currency, notional amount, and timing of rate resets and payments and therefore changes in the fair value attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to be offset by the hedging derivative financial instrument.
61 17 Financial instruments and derivatives continued Hedges of net investments in overseas operations Included within bank borrowings are balances denominated in US dollar and euro which are each designated as hedges of the net investment in the group's US and German subsidiaries respectively.
The aggregate fair value of these borrowings was 31.8m at 31 December 2006.
Foreign exchange gains of 3.2m on translation of the borrowings to sterling at the balance sheet date are recognised within the translation differences reserve in equity, net of exchange losses of 3.4m in respect of the net investments being hedged.
