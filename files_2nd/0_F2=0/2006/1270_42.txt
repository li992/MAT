All embedded derivatives were found to be closely related to their host contracts, and therefore no fair value exercise was required to be undertaken.
Net fair values of derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges were: 2006 2005 m m Contracts with positive fair values: - Interest rate swaps 1.7 0.8 - Forward foreign currency contracts 0.6 0.1 - Fuel derivatives 8.4 19.2 Contracts with negative fair values: - Fuel derivatives 14.6 - The fair values of derivatives have been supplied externally by the respective counterparties to the derivative and by banks using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Retirement benefit obligations At 31 December 2006 the group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their representative independent actuaries.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Merseyside Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2004.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Wales Limited participate in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
Total pension cost The total pension cost for the group was 39.7 million 2005: 39.7 million.
The pension costs in respect of the group's defined contribution schemes were 19.5 million 2005: 17.1 million.
Defined benefit plans The directors believe that separate consideration should be given to the RPS under IAS19 as the group has no rights or obligations in respect of sections of this scheme following the expiry of the franchises.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are therefore shown separately and relate to sections in respect of Arriva Trains Wales Limited only.
The calculations used to assess the IAS19 liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to 31 December 2006 by qualified independent actuaries.
The schemes' assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2006.

The directors assessment of the expected returns is based on historical return trends, the forward looking views of financial markets suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
The actual return on plan assets was 80.3 million 2005: 103.2 million.
