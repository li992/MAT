Notes to the Company Accounts A Accounting policies i Accounting convention The Company accounts are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP using the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of properties and financial instruments.
ii Investment properties Properties are valued at the balance sheet date by the Groups external valuers.
The basis of valuation of properties is described in note D. Any surplus or deficit arising from revaluation is transferred to the revaluation reserve unless a deficit on an individual property is expected to become permanent in which case it is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year.
Interest and outgoings less rental income are capitalised on development properties during the course of development.
A property ceases to be treated as being in the course of development at the earliest of the date when the property is physically complete and becomes available for occupation or the date when the development becomes fully let and income producing.
Leasehold properties where the lease has more than 150 years to expiry are classified as freehold.
iii Depreciation In accordance with SSAP 19: Accounting for Investment Properties, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold properties or leasehold properties with more than 20 years to run as the properties are held for investment and not for consumption.
Depreciation is provided on other fixed assets so as to write off the cost less residual value of each asset over the anticipated useful life.
iv Deferred tax In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
As all of the Companys investment properties are held as long-term investments, deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of those assets.
Following the sale of a property any deferred tax provision not required will be released to the profit and loss account.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability is settled.
v Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps in order to manage the risks arising from its activities as described in more detail in the Financial Review on pages 8 to 10 and in note 19.
Derivatives are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices.
The Company does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments and hence any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the income statement as a finance cost.
vi Pensions The obligations of defined benefit pension schemes, representing benefits accruing to employees, are measured at discounted present value while scheme assets are measured at their fair value.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the profit and loss account: service costs are spread systematically over the working lives of the employees concerned and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions or changes to those assumptions are recognised immediately in equity.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
vii Share and share-based remuneration The cost of equity settled transactions with employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised in the profit and loss account as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the individuals concerned become fully entitled to the award.
The charge is reversed if it appears likely that the performance criteria will not be met.
The Company has used a stochastic option valuation model in calculating the fair value of share options awarded.
B Profit and loss Brixton plc has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The profit for year attributable to shareholders dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 27.2m 2005: 24.1m.
C Cash flow The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to it under FRS 1: Cash Flow Statements and has not prepared a statement of cash flows.
