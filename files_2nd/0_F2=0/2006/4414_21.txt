Notes to the Company financial statements for the financial year ended 31 January 2006 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial information set out on pages 106 to 111 comprises the financial statements of Kesa Electricals plc for the year ended 31 January 2006 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
The financial statements of the Company are prepared under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP using the historical cost convention and are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
New accounting policies The Accounting Standards Board ASB issued Financial Reporting Standard FRS 20 Share-Based Payments in April 2004.
The issue of a grant over the Companys options to its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions by the Company in its subsidiaries.
An additional investment in subsidiaries results with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity.
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the grant issued allocated over the underlying grants vesting period.
The ASB issued FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date in May 2004.
This standard replaced Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 17 Accounting for post-balance-sheet events and the main effect of this change is to prohibit the recording of a provision for a proposed dividend where the dividend is declared after the balance sheet date.
FRS 21 is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
Therefore final dividends are now only recognised in the profit and loss account when shareholders have approved such amounts and interim dividends are only recognised when paid.
During the year the Company also adopted FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement, and FRS 28 Corresponding Amounts.
The adoption of these standards has not had a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.
The following summarises the key principles applied by the Directors in preparing the financial statements.
Investments In the Company balance sheet, investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost adjusted for capital contributions relating to share-based payments.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the balance sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is charged to reflect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Company.
Tangible fixed assets comprise fixtures, fittings and equipment.
These are depreciated over their estimated useful economic life of five years on a straight-line basis.
Employee share schemes The cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares are recognised over the period of the employees related performance.
Where there are no performance criteria, the cost is recognised when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The cost of awards is measured as the fair value of the award at grant date less employee contributions.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2005 06 107 Notes to the Company financial statements for the financial year ended 31 January 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Company are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of minimum lease payments.
Assets capitalised as tangible fixed assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Payments under such leases are charged against the recognised liability and interest costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the full period of the finance lease on a systematic basis.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any financial incentives received from the lessor are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or period to break clause.
Charges made in respect of operating leases of property are adjusted from time to time to reflect the impact of market rent reviews throughout the life of the lease.
Retirement benefits In accordance with FRS 17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the Comet Pension Scheme on a defined contribution scheme basis.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme covers the Company and a number of its subsidiaries and cannot be split between each subsidiary on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Company has therefore taken advantage of the multi-employer exemption allowed by paragraph 9 b of FRS 17.
The pension rights of the Company are dealt with through a self-administered scheme, the assets of which are held independently of the Companys finances.
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme that is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the Company and its subsidiaries at rates advised by independent professional qualified actuaries.
Auditors remuneration During the year the Company paid audit fees and expenses to the Groups auditor of 0.7m 2005: 0.3m comprising 0.4m related to statutory audit 2005: 0.3m and 0.3m related to other assurance services 2005: nil.
