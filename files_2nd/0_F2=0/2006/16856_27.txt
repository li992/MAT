VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p68-106 13 6 06 14:25 Page 72 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs The groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 15th May 2006 and the balance sheet was signed on the boards behalf by CJ Cundy.
VT Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies as set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1st April 2004 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRS.
The principal exception is that financial instrument accounting is determined on different bases in the current year and the comparative year due to the transitional provisions of IAS32 and IAS39.
In preparing this financial information, the group has decided to early adopt the 72 amendment issued in December 2004 to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 120 to 124.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies i Basis of preparation This is the first year in which the group has prepared its financial statements under Adopted IFRS and the comparatives have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP to comply with Adopted IFRS.
The group issued a press release in September 2005 incorporating its preliminary IFRS financial statements for 2005 and the reconciliations to Adopted IFRS from the previously published UK GAAP financial statements are summarised in note 39.
These are the groups first consolidated financial statements and IFRS1 has been applied.
In general, for the first-time adoption of Adopted IFRS, the standards are applied retrospectively.
However, there are a number of exemptions available under IFRS1 and details of the exemptions that the group has applied are shown in the notes to the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
ii Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of VT Group plc and its subsidiaries at each balance sheet date, and include its share of its joint ventures and associates results on the equity method.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
iii Investments in associates and joint ventures Joint ventures are those businesses in which the group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise joint control with its partners under a contractual agreement.
Associates are those businesses in which the group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The post tax results of joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated income statement as an element of profit before tax.
In the consolidated balance sheet the net investment is carried as a fixed asset at the share of the joint ventures or associates equity including any goodwill arising on the groups acquisition of its interest.

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured.
Rendering of services Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction.
Revenue from 73 services provided on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.
The provision of services over a long-term period are treated as construction contracts and the revenue recognised as set out below.
Construction contracts Revenue from construction contracts, including long-term service provision contracts, is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is determined by the costs incurred on the contract to date, to the extent that such costs represent progress made on the project.
A prudent level of profit attributable to the contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Rental income Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
v Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at the lower of fair value of the leased asset and net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long term or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance cost and the reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Rental income is recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis.
vi Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p68-106 13 6 06 14:25 Page 74 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued vii Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Computer equipment 3 to 5 years 74 Fixtures and fittings 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Plant & machinery 5 to 10 years Heavy equipment 20 to 33 years Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
The residual value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
viii Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use.
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
ix Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associated undertaking is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where negative goodwill arises, following re-assessment of fair values, it is credited to the income statement in the period in which the acquisition is made.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill is written down and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the estimated value in use.
Value in use is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 1 April 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts.
No further amortisation charges are incurred following transition to IFRS.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
x Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Following the initial recognition, development expenditure is included in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised over the period of expected future sales from the related project.
The carrying value of development costs is reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use, or more frequently when an indicator of impairment arises during the reporting year indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p68-106 13 6 06 14:25 Page 75 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued xi Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets, excluding development costs, created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are amortised over their remaining useful lives.
75 Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Acquired software licences 2-5 years Trademarks and licences up to 20 years Other intangibles 5-10 years Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
xii Investment properties Land and buildings that are leased to non-group entities are classified as investment properties.
The group applies the cost model to measure investment properties at their cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of investment properties over their estimated useful lives of up to 50 years.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
xiii Impairment The carrying amount of the groups assets are tested for impairment when events occur or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may be impaired.
Goodwill, capitalised development costs and acquired intangibles are subject to annual impairment tests.
Impairments arising are charged to the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
xiv Other investments The group determines the classification of its other investments at initial recognition.
The classification depends upon the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit and loss.
VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p68-106 13 6 06 14:25 Page 76 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risk and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value.
Unrealised gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available-forsale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities.
xv Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 76 ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
xvi Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses.
Appropriate provisions for any losses are made in the year they are first foreseen.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of the contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments.
Other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses.
xvii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts repayable on demand.
xviii Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in foreign operations are taken to a translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the net investment.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS are deemed to be nil under the transitional rules available.
VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p68-106 13 6 06 14:25 Page 77 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued xix Derivative financial instruments From 1 April 2005 The group primarily uses foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to 77 changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for special hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for special hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising in fair value are taken directly to profit or loss for the year.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the year.
Period to 31 March 2005 The group used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments were recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges were recognised on maturity of the underlying transactions.
Gains and losses arising on hedging instruments which were cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure were taken to the income statement immediately.
xx Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
xxi Retirement benefit plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculations, together with the cost of providing benefits under the plans, are performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p68-106 13 6 06 14:25 Page 78 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
xxii Long-term service benefits The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
78 xxiii Share-based payment transactions Share based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the groups share option, incentive and other award schemes.
Share options granted to employees and share based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the vesting period of the scheme, with a corresponding entry recorded within equity.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the vesting period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
The group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2005. xxiv Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work in progress for that portion of the work which has already been completed and as liability provisions for the remainder.
Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts which are updated regularly.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligation under the contract.
xxv Accounting for PFI contracts In determining an appropriate accounting policy for the groups interests in PFI projects under Adopted IFRS, the Group has considered the current status of the project by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC on accounting for service concession arrangements.
IFRIC published three draft interpretations on accounting for service concessions in 2005.
However, the final form of the interpretations and the timetable for IFRIC to finalise and the EU to adopt the interpretations remain uncertain.
In light of this uncertainty, the group considers that until such time as final guidance is issued by IFRIC and adopted by the EU it remains appropriate to apply elements of the approach set out in UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions in accounting for its interests in PFI projects.
This involves applying a risks and rewards test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed.
Once the accounting model has been determined, the recognised assets and liabilities of the PFI projects are measured in accordance with Adopted IFRS: these accounting policies do not differ significantly from those applied previously under UK GAAP.

More specifically the group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Upon adoption of IFRIC 4 the group will have to assess whether any contracts or arrangements convey the right to usage, capacity or output from a specified asset, and hence fall to be accounted for as a lease.
The group have not yet finalised the impact of this accounting interpretation, but do not believe the impact will be material on the reported results.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations noted above will have a material impact on the groups financial statements in the period of initial application.

The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
Secondary segment information is reported geographically.
The groups geographical segments are based on the location of the groups assets.
Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of its customers.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transfers between business segments.
Those transfers are eliminated in consolidation.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 80 reasonable basis.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.

The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.5% 2005: 8.5% and cash flow projections beyond the three year budget are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate 2005: 2.5% that is the same as the long term average growth rate in the UK.
92 The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: Gross margin Discount rates Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period Gross margins are based on the current values being achieved.
Discount rates reflect the companys weighted average cost of capital.
Growth rate estimates are based on published information in respect of long term growth rates.
Management believes that no reasonable change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Those quotes are back tested using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Cash flow hedges The group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows.
Certain of these contracts qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges.
Gains and losses are held in the cash flow hedge reserve and are recycled to the income statement when the related purchases are recorded and recognised in the income statement.
There is an immaterial amount of hedge ineffectiveness related to these hedges.
Gains and losses on cash flow hedges are ultimately recorded in the income statement consistently with the underlying hedged item.
Any gains or losses on cash flow hedges arising due to hedge ineffectiveness would be shown in the income statement within net financing costs.
At 31 March 2006, the group held foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of expected future purchases and expenses in respect of overseas operations for which the group had firm commitments.
The terms of the contracts are as follows: Quantity Maturity Exchange rate Buy Cyprus Pounds 1,904,700 CYP April 2006 - March 2007 CYP 0.84 Euro 6,033,000 EUR April 2006 - March 2007 EUR 1.45 -1.47 Singapore Dollar 4,270,000 SGD April 2006 - March 2007 SGD 2.9 -2.94 Thai Baht 28,500,000 THB April 2006 - March 2007 THB 71.86 72.0 At 31 March 2006, a net unrealised gain of 202,000 with deferred income tax of 61,000 is included in equity in respect of these contracts.
At 31 March 2006 the group also held a forward contract to purchase US$12m in November 2006 at an exchange rate of $ of 1.75 which has not been designated for hedge accounting.
This contract had a fair value of 1,000 at 31 March 2006 and is included as an asset within the balance sheet at 31 March 2006.

On adoption of IAS 39 on 1 April 2005 the following foreign exchange contracts were designated as cash flow hedges: Quantity Maturity Exchange rate Buy Cyprus Pounds 900,000 CYP April 2005 - March 2006 CYP 0.82 Singapore Dollar 2,200,000 SGD April 2005 - March 2006 SGD 2.91-3.0 Thai Baht 16,800,000 THB April 2005 - March 2006 THB 73.2-74.6 UAE Dirhams 3,800,000AED April 2005 - March 2006 AED 6.52- 6.69 100 The above currency contracts had a fair value liability of 67,000 upon adoption of IAS 39 which was deferred in reserves.
Upon settlement of these contracts this amount was transferred to the profit and loss account during the year ended 31 March 2006.
In addition the company held various currency contracts with a fair value liability of 597,000 upon adoption of IAS 39 which were not designated for hedge accounting.
A gain of 598,000 has been included within the profit and loss account for the year, representing the movement in fair value on these contracts.
The group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on certain of its bank borrowings.
Contracts with nominal values of 24.7m have fixed interest payments at a weighted average rate of 5.57% for periods up until 2029 and have floating rate interest receipts at 5.2% plus LIBOR.
The fair value liability of swaps entered into at 31 March 2006 is estimated at 779,000 2005: 1,842,000.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 28,000 2005: nil has been offset against hedged interest payments made in the period.
During the period an interest rate swap contract and related loan balance were terminated.
The interest rate swap had a fair value liability estimated at 1,035,000.
Both the change in fair value and the previously deferred losses on this contract held in equity have been included within the income statement for the year.
Hedge of net investments in foreign entities Included in other loans at 31 March 2006 is a borrowing of US$20m 2005: US$20m, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States subsidiaries.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investment in the subsidiaries.

All plans are equity-settled except where stated.
Share option plans The Group operates two share option plans under which directors and other executives are eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options are granted at market value, determined immediately before the grant.
Share options vest in equal tranches on the 3rd, 4th and 5th anniversaries of the date of the grant subject to achievement of a performance condition.
The performance condition currently applying is real growth in earnings per share of at least 2% pa for options granted before May 2005 and 3% pa for options granted thereafter, over three consecutive years.
These share options have a maximum life of 10 years.
101 Deferred annual bonus scheme DABS The group operates a deferred annual bonus scheme for senior executives.
Under the provisions of the scheme members are required to defer 40% of their annual bonus which is used to acquire shares to that value.
In addition, employees have the option to defer a further portion of annual bonus to acquire additional shares, up to a maximum of 35% of annual bonus.
The deferred shares are held in trust for a period of three years.
At the end of the three year period employees will receive these shares together with a matching element from the company.
The quantum of the matching element is dependant upon earnings per share growth targets.
The maximum matching element obtainable is three times the deferred shares originally held for an employee.
Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP The long-term incentive plan was established as an incentive scheme for executive directors and other selected senior executives.
Under the terms of the scheme, employees may be awarded shares equal in value up to 50% of basic salary.
The grant of awards is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The shares are held in trust and released after three years pro rata to achievement of the performance target.
The performance criteria is the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the comparator group which currently comprises the members of the FTSE 250 but excluding Investment Trusts but for future years the remuneration committee has the discretion in addition to relate the TSR to the Defence sector or the Support services sector.
Shares vest fully if the companys performance equals or exceeds the upper quartile of the comparator group but there is no vesting if performance is below the median.
Each time share awards are made under the LTIP employees are entitled to invest, subject to certain conditions, up to 5% of basic salary to purchase additional shares in the company Retained Shares.
These shares are held in the trust for at least three years and they are then matched on a 1:1 basis with further shares Matching Shares.
Share incentive plan SIP The group operates a share incentive plan open to all employees.
Under this plan employees are granted share options subject to the group meeting certain financial profit targets.
Options are granted at the market value on date of the award and vest unconditionally if the employee remains in service for a period of 3 years from the date of the award.
The contractual life of the options is five years and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Employee Share Option Savings Plans ESOP The group operates Share Option Savings Plans for all eligible employees, whereby employees can save towards the exercise price payable for an award of share options.
The exercise price of these options is set at 90% of the market value of the share price at the date of grant.
Under awards granted by the group, the savings period is ether 3 or 5 years for UK based employees and 2 years for US based employees.
At the end of the savings period, the options vest and the option holders have a 6 month window in which to exercise their options.

For the options outstanding as at 31 March 2006 the weighted average remaining contractual life is 4.2 years 2005: 4.1 years.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was nil 2005: 2.61.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the year end was 2.20 2.61 2005: 2.20 2.58.
Share option valuation assumptions The fair value of options granted were measured using the Black-Scholes method for the share option plans and Employee Share Options Savings Plans, the Monte-Carlo method for the grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, and a simplified BlackScholes method for the matching shares granted within the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The weighted average assumptions used in determining fair value of options granted were as follows: Share options Long-term incentive plan Share options plans savings plans 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Dividend yield 2.9% 3.4% 3.0% 3.1% 3% Expected volatility 23.9% 24.2% 21.8% 22.6% 23.1% Riskfree interest rate 4.1% 5.2% 4.3% 4.6% 4.4% Expected life 3 years 3 years 5 years 5 years 4.1years Exercise price 334p 267p 324p 295.5p 261p No options were issued under the share savings plan during the year ended 31st March 2006.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan includes a market vesting condition linked to the Total Shareholder Return TSR of a comparator group which requires the volatility of comparator companies share prices and the average correlation between the share prices of the Company and the comparator companies to be considered in assessing the fair value of options granted.
The following approach has been adopted for these items: Comparator company volatility Annualised, daily historic volatility assessed over a period prior to the date of grant that corresponds to the period over which the TSR is being projected: Company correlation Taken as the average correlation of TSR between all of the companies over the same historic period.

36 Contingent liabilities 106 In the ordinary course of business group companies from time to time enter into contracts which can account for a substantial part of the consolidated revenue.
In connection with these contracts, particularly with overseas customers, group companies are required to undertake significant obligations in relation to the performance and financing of the contracts.
In the opinion of the directors, no further provision is required in respect of these obligations.
The company has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

The UK schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered funds.
The US scheme was a new scheme in the year and is an unfunded scheme.
The group hold a life assurance policy which is to be used to fund retirement benefits arising.
Under IAS 19 this insurance policy is deemed to be a non-qualifying insurance policy and as such is not an asset of the pension scheme.
The asset is instead a corporate-owned asset and is included within the balance sheet note 19.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using 107 the projected unit credit method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published forecasts to each category of scheme assets.

For the main SIPS scheme the actuarial table used is PMA 92 PFA 92, which allows for expected increases in longevity.
The table has been adjusted for deferred members and pensioners to reflect actual scheme experience.
In addition, following actuarial advice the mortality assumption for the SIPS scheme for 2006 includes a medium cohort effect reflecting improved longevity of members born between 1925 and 1945.
The inclusion of this cohort effect strengthens the mortality assumption within the actuarial calculation.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 60 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 87 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 90.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate in the SIPS scheme were to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by 6m.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p107-IBC 13 6 06 14:27 Page 112 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 39 Explanation of transition to IFRS As stated in note 2, these are the groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The accounting policies set out in note 2 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
The restated financial information for the year to 31 March 2005 has been prepared on the same basis with the exception of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39.
In November 2004 the EU endorsed a reduced version of IAS 39 as issued previously by the IASB.
With effect from 1 April 2005 the group has adopted IAS 39 in accordance with the guidance issued by the IASB.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared 112 in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following table and the notes that accompany the tables.
IFRS 1 exemptions IFRS 1 sets out the rules for an entity preparing its first IFRS financial statements.
The entity is required to determine the IFRS accounting policies in accordance with the IFRS that are in place and, in general, apply them retrospectively.
There are a number of possible exemptions from the retrospective application to assist an entity in making the transition.
The group has taken the following exemptions: Business combinations prior to the transition date 1 April 2004 have not been restated to an IFRS basis.
All cumulative actuarial gains and losses on the groups defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in equity at the date of transition.
Financial instruments in the comparative period are recorded on the existing UK GAAP basis, rather than in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39, which have been adopted from 1 April 2005.
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates requires translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign operation to be classified as a separate component of equity.
In accordance with IFRS 1, the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero at the date of transition.
IFRS 2 requires a profit and loss charge to be made in respect of all share-based payment arrangements based upon the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
The group has taken advantage of the transitional rules that permit options issued prior to 7 November 2002 to be excluded from this treatment.

Any up-front payment made to obtain the right to use the land is capitalised as a lease prepayment and recognised over the lease term as an operating lease expense.
Accordingly 4m previously disclosed within property, plant & equipment under UK GAAP is reclassified as a long-term prepayment under IFRS.
The related depreciation charge under UK GAAP is reclassified as an operating lease charge under IFRS.
IAS 16 provides more definitive guidance in that it requires spare parts, stand-by and servicing equipment held for use 115 over more than one accounting period are classified as property plant & equipment as opposed to inventories.
Accordingly, a reclassification of 1m reducing inventories and increasing property, plant & equipment is reflected at 31 March 2005 2004: 0.7m.
IAS 38 requires software costs that are not an integral part of a tangible fixed asset to be classified as intangible assets, whereas UK GAAP included such costs as tangible fixed assets.
Accordingly, net book value of 2.6m 2004: 1.8m previously disclosed as tangible assets under UK GAAP is reclassified as intangible assets under IFRS.
IAS 40 requires that all land and buildings owned but not in use within the group are separately classified as investment property.
Accordingly, 0.9m previously disclosed as property, plant and equipment under UK GAAP has been separately presented as Investment Property under IFRS.
b Goodwill and business combinations IFRS requires that more intangible assets of an acquired business are separately recognised from goodwill if their fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets recognised are then amortised over their useful life.
As a result of acquisitions made in the year ended 31 March 2005, intangible assets of 4.9m were transferred out of goodwill arising on acquisition, with an associated amortisation charge of 0.1m for the year.
In addition, IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill and accordingly the UK GAAP amortisation charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 of 9.1m was reversed upon transition.
IFRS 3 also requires that subsequent adjustments made to fair values from business combinations made within 12 months of the date of acquisition are treated as prior period adjustments.
As a result of fair value adjustments arising during the year ended 31 March 2006 in respect of prior year acquisitions, goodwill has been increased by 0.2m from that previously stated.
This fair value adjustment also required the recognition of additional employee benefit liabilities of 2.5m and a reduction in trade and other payables of 0.6m.
The minority interest was also reduced by 0.9m to reflect the minority share of the net asset adjustments made.
Goodwill of 4m in respect of a joint venture investment was also transferred from goodwill and included within the carrying value of equity accounted investments upon conversion to IFRS.
c Equity accounted investments Upon conversion to IFRS, certain adjustments were required to align the financial statements of joint ventures and associates with the principles of IFRS.
In particular, IFRS requires the inclusion of retirement benefit liabilities within the balance sheet.
At 31 March 2005, these adjustments led to a reduction in the carrying value of equity accounted investments of 3.8m 2004: 4.4m.
d Employee benefits IFRS requires liabilities within company sponsored pension schemes to be included within the reported assets of the group.
At 31 March 2005 this has required including a liability of some 61.7m 2004: 79.9m within the balance sheet, including the fair value adjustment arising as noted above.
An associated deferred tax asset arising of 18.5m 2004: 24m also arises in respect of this adjustment.
In addition a non-current debtor balance arising under the previous UK GAAP accounting rules of 5m 2004: 5m was removed from the balance sheet.
Deferred tax liabilities were also reduced by 1.5m 2004: 1.5m as a result of the removal of this asset.
IFRS also contains more detailed guidance in accounting for other long-term employee benefits, including holiday pay and retirement leave.
As a result an additional liability of 2.5m 2004: 2.7m has been included upon conversion to IFRS, analysed a current liabilities of 1.6m 2004: 1.9m and non-current liabilities of 0.9m 2004: 0.8m.
An associated deferred tax asset of 0.8m 2004: 0.9m has also been recognised in respect of these additional liabilities.

Accordingly a grossing up adjustment of 1.9m has been made to deferred tax balances at 31 March 2005 2004: 2.9m.
IFRS has also resulted in recognition of the following additional deferred tax assets as compared with UK GAAP: 31 March 2005 31 March 2004 m m 116 Deferred tax asset arising on: IAS 19 pension deficits note d 18.5 24.0 Other employee benefits note d 0.8 0.9 Share-based payments note l 0.6 0.2 Business combinations 0.3 0.6 20.2 25.7 Conversion to IFRS has resulted in the recognition of the following additional deferred tax liabilities: 31 March 2005 31 March 2004 m m Deferred tax liability arising on: Business combinations 0.6 IAS 18 Contract accounting note g 0.9 Removal of UK GAAP pension liability note d 1.5 1.5 0.9 2.4 f Income tax Under IFRS there is a requirement to show income tax assets separately from income tax liabilities.
Accordingly a grossing up adjustment of 3.4m has been made to income tax balances at 31 March 2005 2004: 2.7m.
Other adjustments arising from conversion to IFRS have resulted in a reduction in tax liabilities of 1.4m for the year ended 31 March 2005 being recognised in respect of contract accounting note g g Contract accounting IFRS contains more detailed guidance in respect of accounting for long-term contracts and service contracts, including whether contracts should be aggregated or segregated.
As a result of differences arising from previous UK GAAP accounting treatment, contract related debtors were reduced by 0.5m at 31 March 2005 2004: increase of 0.4m.
Contract related creditors were also increased by 4.2m 2004: 3.9m.
At 31 March 2005 this has also resulted in a reduction of income tax liabilities of 1.4m and at 31 March 2004 a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of 0.9m.
h Cash and cash equivalents IFRS contains more detailed rules in respect of set-off of borrowings against cash balances.
As a result of these changes cash balances have increased upon conversion to IFRS by 10.6m at 31 March 2005 2004: 10.9m, with a corresponding increase in the interest bearing loans and borrowings balances.

k Provisions In a change from UK GAAP, IFRS requires that provisions are analysed between those amounts that will be utilised within the next twelve months and those that are longer-term in nature.
As a result 12.6m 2004: 20.8m of provisions have been reclassified as current liabilities upon conversion to IFRS.
l Share-based payments IFRS requires that charges are made in respect share-based transactions based upon fair values of the equity instruments concerned, which is a change from UK GAAP.
For the year ended 31 March 2005 a charge of 0.5m arises in respect of equity settled share based payments which is credited directly to equity within the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets of 0.6m 2004: 0.2m also arise as a result of this new accounting requirement.
Upon transition to IFRS, a creditor in respect of share options amounting to 2.8m 2004: 0.9m has been reclassified as a component of equity.
m Proposed dividends IFRS requires that dividends are only recognised when they have been approved by shareholders.
As a consequence of this change from UK GAAP, trade and other payables have been reduced as compared to UK GAAP by the final proposed dividend of 12.1m for the year ended 31 March 2005 2004: 11.1m.

As a result of differences arising from previous UK GAAP accounting treatment, reported revenue for the year ended 31 March 2005 was reduced by 1.1m upon conversion to IFRS.
The impact on the taxation charge of this adjustment was to reduce the tax charge for the year by 0.3m.
ii Business combinations, goodwill amortisation and intangible assets Under IFRS goodwill is no longer systematically amortised, but is tested annually for impairment.
As a result the amortisation charge of 9.1m included within cost of sales has been reversed upon conversion.
IFRS also require that additional intangible assets are identified in business combination transactions as compared to UK GAAP.
Such intangible assets are subject to annual amortisation charges.
The charge for the year arising from such separately identified intangible assets was 0.1m, which has been included within administrative expenses.
IAS 12, Income Taxes, also contains changes to the treatment of fair value adjustments arising in business combinations.
As a result of these changes and the transactions noted above, the tax charge for the year was increased by 0.5m as compared to UK GAAP.
VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p107-IBC 13 6 06 14:27 Page 119 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 39 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Notes to the reconciliation of profit continued iii Employee benefits IFRS introduces new methods of accounting for retirement benefits as compared to previous UK GAAP.
Charges for retirement benefits are based upon the service provided by employees in any one accounting period and are measured with external actuarial advice.
As a result of these changes additional charges to cost of sales of 2.9m and administration expenses of 0.7m were incurred upon conversion to IFRS.
IFRS also contains more detailed rules in respect of accounting for other short and long-term employee benefits, including holiday pay and long-service leave.
The impact of adopting these rules for the year ended 31 March 2005 was to reduce cost 119 of sales by 0.2m.
The taxation charge for the year was reduced by 1m as a consequence of these changes.
iv Share-based payments In a change from UK GAAP, IFRS requires that charges are made for all share based transactions, including employee share options.
These charges are based upon the fair value of the relevant equity instruments at the date of inception of the transaction.
As a result of this new accounting standard administration expenses were increased by 0.5m for the year ended 31 March 2005.
The tax charge for the year was increased by 0.1m as a result of the adoption of this standard.
v Equity accounted investments Where the group chooses under IAS 31 to adopt the equity method of accounting for investments in joint ventures and associates, IFRS requires that the results of such investments are presented in the income statement for the year as a single line item.
This single line item is measured as the profit after taxation arising from such investments.
As a result financial income relating to joint venture investments of 1m has been reclassified upon conversion to IFRS as profit arising from equity accounted investments.
Similarly the reported taxation charge for the year has been reduced by 4m with an equal reduction in profits arising from equity accounted investments.
