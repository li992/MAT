New accounting policies Prior year adjustments The Accounting Standards Board ASB issued FRS 20 Share Based Payment in April 2004.
The company incurs a charge under this standard, which is allocated to its subsidiaries based on the employing company of the relevant employee.
In the year ended 31 May 2005 this has been capitalised as a cost of investment, which has led to a prior period adjustment to retained earnings of 8.9m with a corresponding increase in the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
The ASB issued FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet date in May 2004.
This prohibits the recording of a provision for a proposed dividend where the dividend is declared after the balance sheet date.
The effect on the comparative figures is to exclude the 2005 proposed final dividend from the balance sheet at 31 May 2005 resulting in retained earnings and equity shareholders funds increasing by 20.7m.
Current year transition The ASB issued FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange rates, FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement in December 2004.
These standards do not require the restatement of comparative periods.
This has resulted in a 0.3m charge recognised in retained earnings in respect of the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate caps at 1 June 2005.
