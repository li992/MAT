30 Accounting policies continued Employee share schemes The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 and those not yet vested as at 1 January 2005 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value is measured based on an option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date and settlement date with any changes to fair value being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Development expenditure Development expenditure is written off to the profit and loss account in the period in which it is incurred.
