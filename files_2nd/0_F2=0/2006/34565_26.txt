Notes to the accounts 56 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 For the year ended 30 December 2006 1 Significant accounting policies General information Capital & Regional plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 2 and in the operating and financial review on pages 6 to 35.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IFRS1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC 10 Interin reporting and impairments IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service concession agreements The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and interpretaions in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into force for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the first time in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are explained in note 32.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are presented in sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment and development properties, owner-occupied properties and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently, to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Key judgements include the estimation of fair values of investment properties and derivative financial statements, the assessment of estimated useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and estimates of trade receivables impairment provisions.
Management believes that the estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
If the revision affects both current and future periods, the charge is recognised over those periods.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity, or business, to benefit from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The reporting period for subsidiaries ends on 31 December and the financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated from this date.
Joint ventures and associates In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures, associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method, whereby the consolidated balance sheet and income statement incorporate the Groups share of the net assets and profit after tax.
The profits include revaluation movements on investment properties.
The reporting period for joint ventures and associates ends on 31 December and the financial statements of joint ventures and associates are consolidated from this date.
57 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 1 Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Where the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is greater than the cost, the excess, known as negative goodwill, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they relate to the hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The operating income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period.
Significant transactions, such as property sales, are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the end of the year, 1 1.484 2005: 1 1.457.
The principal exchange rate used for the income statement is the average rate, 1 1.467 2005: 1 1.457.
Plant and equipment Tangible fixed assets are stated at the lower of cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties and land, over their expected useful lives: Fixtures and fittings over three to five years, on a straight-line basis.
Motor vehicles over four years, on a straight-line basis.
Property portfolio Investment properties Investment properties are stated at fair value, being the market value determined by professionally qualified external values, with changes in fair value being included in the income statement.
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is provided in respect of properties.
Leasehold properties Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Owner-occupied long-leasehold properties Owner-occupied long-leasehold properties are included in the financial statements stated at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
The cost of owner-occupied property is depreciated through the income statement over the period to the end of the lease on a straight-line basis having due regard to its estimated residual value.
Properties under development Attributable internal and external costs incurred during the period of development are capitalised, Interest is capitalised gross before deduction of related deferred tax relief.
Interest is calculated on the development expenditure by reference to specific borrowings where relevant.
A property ceases to be treated as being under development when substantially all activities that are necessary to get the property ready for use are complete.
Refurbishment expenditure Refurbishment expenditure in respect of major works is capitalised.
Renovation and refurbishment expenditure of a revenue nature is expensed as incurred.
Property transactions Acquisitions and disposals are accounted for at the date of legal completion.
Properties are transferred between categories at the estimated market value on the transfer date.
Notes to the accounts continued 58 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 For the year ended 30 December 2006 1 Significant accounting policies continued Property portfolio continued Current property assets Properties held with the intention of disposal are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Head leases Where an investment property is held under a head lease, the head lease is initially recognised as an asset at the sum of the present value of the minimum lease ground rent payable.
The corresponding rent liability to the leaseholder is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Tenant leases and incentives Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and concluded that all such leases are operating leases.
Lease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Borrowings and derivatives Borrowings Borrowings are held at amortised cost.
They are recognised initially at fair value, after taking into account of any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, such discounts and costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowing at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Convertible unsecured loan stock CULS CULS are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of the issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying value of the CULS.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting As defined by IAS 39 derivatives are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement in finance cost line as they arise.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Tax Tax is included in the Group income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are never taxable or tax deductible permanent differences or will be taxable at a later date temporary differences.
Temporary differences principally arise from using different balance sheet values for assets and liabilities from their respective tax base values.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on these temporary differences with the exception of: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred 59 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 1 Significant accounting policies continued Tax continued tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Operating leases Annual rentals under operating leases are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Employee benefits Pension costs Pension liabilities, all of which relate to defined contribution schemes, are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP The Group has applied the arrangements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of share-based employee remuneration is calculated using a normal distribution model, which the directors consider not to be materially different from the binominal model.
The fair value is dependent on factors including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk free interest rate.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line over the vesting period.
Own shares Own shares held by the Group are shown as a deduction from shareholders funds, and included in other reserves.
The cost of own shares is transferred from the own shares held reserve to the retained earnings reserve systematically over the LTIP performance period.
The shares are held in an Employee Share Ownership Trust.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted to reflect the time value of money.
Revenue Performance and management fees Performance and management fees are recognised, in line with the property management contracts, in the period to which they relate.
CRPM earns performance fees on the out performance relative to appropriate IPD index, of the associated Mall and Junction Funds and the fixed benchmark for the X-Leisure Fund.
Management fees include income in relation to services provided by CRPM to both the joint ventures and the associated funds for asset management, rent reviews, lettings, project co-ordination, procurement, service charges and directly recoverable expenditure.
Net rental income Net rental income is equal to gross rental income, recognised in the period to which it relates, less property expenses directly related to letting and holding the properties.
Interest and dividend income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment have been established.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses 2005: nil.
The remaining tax losses have not been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
The calculation of the Groups tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
In such cases, the Group has reserved on the basis that these provisions are required.
If all such issues are resolved in the Groups favour, provisions of up to 18.4 million could be released in future periods.
A significant part of the Groups property interests is held offshore.
The Group has also undertaken a restructuring of its activities to separate legally its income and earnings businesses, in line with its business model.
The Group has been advised that no capital gains tax liability arises on these transactions although the relevant computations have yet to be agreed.

12 Goodwill m As at 30 December 2005 and 30 December 2006 12.2 The goodwill carried in the Group balance sheet relates to the acquisition of the MWB fund management business, by CRPM, in 2003, which included MWBs 13.29% interest in Leisure Fund 1, 5.72% interest in Leisure Fund IIa and 7.09% interest in Leisure Fund IIb.
This goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill might be impaired.
Impairment is tested by comparing the carrying amount of CRPMs assets and liabilities with its estimated market value.
Estimates of the market value of CRPM are taken from the publicly available research from various City firms who regularly report on Capital & Regional plc.
These estimates are calculated by using price earnings ratios and percentage asset under management multiples of the quoted equity fund management sector.

19 Convertible subordinated unsecured loan stock In 1996 the Company issued 26 million of Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock CULS.
Under IFRS these are accounted for as part debt and part equity.
Interest is charged on the debt at an effective rate of 11.25% of which 6.75% is paid as a coupon and the balance rolled up in to the value of the debt.
The debt element is marked to market on the assumption that the debt remains outstanding until 2016 when it is repayable.
Since 1996 the majority of the CULS have either been converted or bought back in the market by the Group.
At 30 December 2006 and at the date of this report, CULS with a nominal value of 1.7 million remained.
The balance sheet contains the following balances relating to CULS: 30 December 30 December 2006 2005 Note m m Nominal value of CULS 1.7 4.1 Equity component net of deferred tax 0.5 1.0 Deferred tax liability 0.1 0.4 1.1 2.7 Net interest 0.2 0.3 Liability component at balance sheet date 18a, b, e 1.3 3.0 The CULS may be converted by the holders of the stock into 51.42 2005: 51.42 ordinary shares per 100 nominal value CULS in any of the years 1997 to 2015 inclusive, representing a conversion price of 194p 2005: 194p per ordinary share.
The Company has the right to redeem at par the CULS in any year from 2006 to 2016.
The CULS are unsecured and are subordinated to all other forms of unsecured debt but rank in priority to the holders of the ordinary shares in the Company.
75 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 20 Financial instruments and risk management Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The Groups risk management policies and practices are as follows: Debt management The Group normally raises bank debt on a floating rate basis and fixes a substantial portion of the interest payments by entering into interest rate swaps.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to fair value risk from its fixed rate debt and interest rate risk from its floating rate debt and cash.
Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to floating rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
The Group has interest rate swaps of 281 million maturing within the next five years.
Under these swaps the Group pays interest at an average fixed rate of 4.84%.
At 30 December 2006, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of 3.4 million 2005: 0.7 million asset.
The Group does not hedge account its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
Cash management Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
These amounts are presented net of all allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and tenants.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses net investment hedging to hedge its exposure to the euro and its German operations.
Effective interest rates and financial maturity analysis In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and shows a maturity analysis of individual elements.

Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in interest and foreign exchange rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 30 December 2006, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.2 million 2005: 0.8 million due to the increase in interest expense which is offset by the effect of interest rate swaps.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in value of the euro against sterling would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.4 million for the year ended 30 December 2006 2005: 0.2 million.

The fair value of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using market discount rates.
Details of the Groups cash and deposits are set out in note 16.

83 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 32 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 2006 is the first year that the Group will present its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements presented under UK GAAP were for the year ended 30 December 2005.
As IFRS comparatives must be presented for the year ended 30 December 2005, the date of transition was 31 December 2004.
Reconciliations are presented on the following pages to enable comparison of the 2006 figures with those published in the corresponding period in the previous financial year and those published for the year ended 30 December 2005.
When preparing the Groups IFRS balance sheet at 31 December 2004, the following material optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies have been adopted.
Business combinations the provision of IFRS 3 Business Combinations have been applied from 30 December 2004.
The Group has chosen not to restate business combinations that fall before the date of transition.
Financial instruments the Group has applied IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for all periods presented and has therefore not taken advantage of the option that would enable the Group to only apply the standards from 30 December 2005.

Whilst the format of the cash flow statement is different under UK GAAP, there are no material changes to cash flows from operations, investment or financing.
Notes UK GAAP referred to in the table in note 33 is that existing at 30 December 2005.
The principal reasons for the adjustments shown in the reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS are set out below: a Under UK GAAP goodwill is amortised over its expected useful economic life.
Under IFRS goodwill is carried at cost and an annual impairment review undertaken.
b Under UK GAAP negative goodwill is carried in the balance sheet.
Under IFRS negative goodwill should be credited to the income statement.
c Under UK GAAP proposed dividends are included in the profit and loss account and as a liability in the balance sheet.
Under IFRS unapproved and unpaid dividends are not provided for.
d Under IFRS deferred tax provisions are made for the tax that would potentially be payable on the sale of investment or development properties and other assets, whereas UK GAAP requires that this potential liability is disclosed as contingent tax but not provided for in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax arising on valuation changes and other items are included in the income statement under IFRS.
e Under IFRS the debt and equity components of convertible instruments are separate, whereas under UK GAAP the nominal value of the CULS are held as a liability on the balance sheet net of issue costs.
f The fair value of interest rate swaps is included in the balance sheet with effect from 31 December 2004. g Under UK GAAP rent-free periods are allocated over the period of the first rent review.
Under IFRS rent-free periods are allocated over the period to the first break option, or if the probability that the break option will not be exercised is considered low, over the full lease term.
h Under UK GAAP lease incentive such as cash inducements and contributions to tenant fit out are either written off, capitalised or capitalised and amortised, depending upon their nature.
Under IFRS all such costs are capitalised and amortised over the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the break option will be exercised is considered low, over the full lease term.
i Under UK GAAP letting costs are either capitalised on the first letting of a unit or on subsequent lettings written off in the year they are incurred.
Under IFRS all such costs are capitalised and amortised over the period to the first break, or if the probability that the break option will not be exercised is considered low, over the full lease term.
j IFRS requires that valuation changes on investment properties are included in the income statement.
k In 2005 the vesting conditions for 50% of the LTIP were changed and linked to the FTSE Real Estate Index.
Under IFRS this constitutes a market condition and the fair value is assessed on the expected shares that will vest based on Capital & Regional's relative position compared to the index.
The fair value of the shares at the date of the award is charged over the vesting period.
l IFRS requires that where a lease is treated as a finance lease the net present value of all payments under the lease are capitalised into the value of the investment property and an associated liability included in the balance sheet.
m Under IFRS the minority interest has been reclassified as a non-current payable and the minorities share of the income statement has been treated as a financing charge.
n As the items that this tax relates to are charged to the income statement under IFRS the related tax is also shown in the income statement.
