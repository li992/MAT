Analysis of investments held at fair value: 31 December 2006 31 December 2005 000 000 Money market funds 257,634 - Fixed income securities: Government bonds - 83,071 Other listed securities - 156,071 Variable interest securities: Other listed securities - 16,795 257,634 255,937 Management of credit and market risk Amounts recoverable from reinsurers expose the Group to credit risk.
To mitigate this risk, the Group only conducts business with companies with specified financial strength ratings.
The other primary form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders.
Credit risk arises due to the potential for default on credit card payments.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and the low level of the average balance recoverable.
This risk is also mitigated by the operation of controls over this area including the automated cancellation procedures for those policies in default, resulting in minimal financial impact.
The Group switched investment strategy during the second half of 2006, away from short duration fixed income securities and into money market cash funds or cash deposits.
Prior to this change, the Group was exposed to market risk in terms of the impact of movements in market interest rates on the carrying value of the investment funds.
This risk has now been virtually eliminated, as the money market funds are designed to achieve stable net asset values.
The Groups investment returns should now directly track underlying market interest rates and hence will rise or fall in line with this benchmark.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had fully liquidated the fixed income portfolios.
