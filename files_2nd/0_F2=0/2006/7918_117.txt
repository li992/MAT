Certain instruments were included in net debt resulting in net debt being adjusted at 1 January 2005 as shown on page 110.
The own shares that the Group had acquired, or was committed to acquire under forward contracts, to hedge its obligations under various share option schemes were included in treasury stock under IAS 32.
The amount included in net debt as at 1 January 2005, reflecting the extent that the contracts were out of the money, was 63m: interest rate swaps were recognised at fair value and certain loans previously held at amortised cost were adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk.
This resulted in an increase in net debt of 6m through an increase in the value of loans of 14m, partly offset by a reduction in the value of swaps of 8m.
