Impairment losses of 0.9m of goodwill attaching to business units pending closure where the future cash flows from these are not expected to recover the goodwill carrying value are recognised within operating expenses in the income statement 2005 : 1.1m recognised during the year are in respect of goodwill of MG Rover franchises impaired following the collapse of the manufacturer.
Goodwill is allocated across multiple cash-generating units and consequently a consistent approach in assessing the carrying value of this amount is taken.
This value was determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit and was based on the following key assumptions: Cash flows were projected based on actual operating results and the current business plan with regard to the long term strategy of the group in terms of business representation.
These were extrapolated over a 20 year period.
Management believes that this forecast period was justified due to the long term outlook for the industry and the groups dominant position in the market place.
Whilst it is anticipated that the units will grow revenues in the future for the purpose of the impairment testing no growth has been assumed.
A pre tax discount rate of eight percent was applied in determining the recoverable amount of the units which the group have estimated to be the approximate weighted average cost of capital of the group.
