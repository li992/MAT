Explanation of transition to IFRSs This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the date of transition to IFRSs was therefore 1 April 2004.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1 establishes the transitional requirements for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the first time.
The general principle is that the IFRS effective at the first-time adoption reporting date 31 March 2006 for the Group are to be applied retrospectively to the opening IFRS balance sheet 1 April 2004, the comparative period year ended 31 March 2005 and the reporting period year ended 31 March 2006.
Outlined below is the Groups position in relation to key exemptions and exceptions that are available under IFRS.
Share-based Payment IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has only been applied to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Accordingly, IFRS 2 has not been applied to the grants of equity instruments before 7 November 2002 or for those instruments that have vested or lapsed prior to 1 January 2005.
Employee benefits Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the Group is required to reflect its obligations or surpluses under defined benefit pension schemes on the balance sheet.
The Group has elected under IFRS 1 to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes at the date of transition to IFRS.
On transition to IFRS, the Group has recognised the full IAS 19 liability in respect of Homeserves share of the Water Companies Pension Scheme.
Business combinations The Group has adopted the exemption not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations in respect of acquisitions occurring prior to 1 April 2004.
Accordingly, the Group will adopt IFRS 3 to the extent that it applies to acquisitions post 1 April 2004 only.
Acquisitions before that date will be recorded as under UK GAAP.
Cumulative translation differences The Group has adopted the exemption to set cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to zero at 1 April 2004.
The gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any foreign operation will exclude translation differences that arose before 1 April 2004, but will include later translation differences.

This adjustment represents the reversal of the final proposed dividend for 2004. b IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires defined benefit pension scheme surpluses or deficits to be reflected on the balance sheet.
This adjustment represents the deficit on the Groups scheme at 1 April 2004. c Gains associated with share option schemes generate deferred tax assets which can offset the income statement charge under IFRS2 Share Based Payments.
The deferred tax credit taken to the income statement is restricted to the cumulative income statement charge under IFRS2.
Any additional deferred tax asset is taken directly to reserves.
This adjustment represents the surplus deferred tax asset over the 236,000 IFRS 2 charge.
d Under IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures, provision for the Groups share of joint venture losses are not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets below zero.
This adjustment represents the reversal of the provision previously reported under UK GAAP.
e Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax liabilities cannot be discounted as permitted by UK GAAP.
The Group historically adopted a policy of discounting and this adjustment represents the reversal of the cumulative discount on deferred tax provisions.
f The methodology used by all Water companies under UK GAAP to account for infrastructure assets is not consistent with IFRS and hence restatement is required.
The adjustment represents the increase in valuation of the infrastructure assets, with a corresponding increase in reserves.
g Under IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the assets and liabilities of the Commercial Outsourcing business, many of which met the definition of a disposed group at 1 April 2004, have been restated to the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
This adjustment represents the write down of the net assets based on expected net proceeds at 1 April 2004.
In addition, they are separately disclosed as assets and liabilities held for disposal as at 1 April 2004.
Further details of the Groups IFRS adjustments can be found in the publication Homeserve plc Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, announced on 28 November 2005 and available on our website www.

This adjustment represents the reversal of the 2005 final proposed dividend.
b IFRS 3 Business Combinations prohibits the amortisation of goodwill as it is considered to have an indefinite life.
This adjustment represents the reversal of the goodwill amortisation charge under UK GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2005. c The adjustment represents the additional loss on disposal of the Commercial Outsourcing division following the reversal of the goodwill amortisation charge associated with these businesses noted above.
The income statement adjustment represents the derecognition of the loss on disposal of goodwill previously written off to reserves.
d Franchise assets, customer databases and customer relationships which meet the criteria of identifiable non-monetary assets are classified as an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets and amortised over their useful economic life.
The effect of this is to reclassify assets from goodwill, in respect of acquisitions post 1 April 2004, to other intangible assets.
The adjustment to reserves reflects the amortisation charge in the period.
Net assets are not affected by the reclassification.
IAS 38 also requires software applications or licences that are not an inherent part of the IT hardware, for example the operating system, to be recognised as an intangible asset.
The effect of this is to reclassify assets from property, plant and equipment to other intangible assets.
Net assets are not affected by this adjustment.
e Previously under UK GAAP, the share scheme charges to the income statement were held as long term liabilities.
IFRS permits the reclassifications of these charges to equity.
This adjustment represents the increase in equity on Long Term Incentive Plan share charges to 31 March 2005. f IAS 19 Employee benefits requires defined benefit pension scheme surpluses or deficits to be reflected on the balance sheet.
This adjustment represents the shortfall on the Groups scheme as at 31 March 2005 and the reduced charge to the income statement in the period when implementing IAS 19 compared to IFRS 17. g Under IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures, provision for the Groups share of joint venture losses are not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets below zero.
In addition, goodwill on the acquisition of joint ventures is reclassified out of goodwill and into interests in joint ventures.
h Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax liabilities cannot be discounted as permitted by UK GAAP.
In addition, goodwill on the acquisition of joint ventures is reclassified out of goodwill and into interests in joint ventures i IFRS 2 Share Based Payments requires the recognition of an expense in relation to all share-based payments such as the Groups share and share option schemes.
The adjustment represents the additional charge of share based payments in the period.
j This adjustment represents the reversal of prior period provisions for discontinued operations as noted above in the notes for the reconciliation of equity at 1 April 2004, g. k IAS 17 Leases operating lease incentives must be spread over the full term of the lease rather than over the period to the first rent review.
This adjustment represents additional charges over the reduced period.
