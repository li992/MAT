Under that law the directors have prepared Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
In addition, as far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware and each of the directors have taken all the steps that he ought to have taken in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of such information.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company hence for taking responsible steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the website.
Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Presentation of the financial statements Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The directors have reviewed the Company's existing accounting policies and consider that they are consistent with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 'FRS' 18 ' Accounting Policies'.
The Company's accounting policies are consistent with last year.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is Sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the time of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are taken to the profit and loss account.
Nonmonetary items are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency and translated using the exchange rates of the original statement.
The presentation currency of the Company is the US Dollar due to the fact that the majority of its subsidiaries have a US dollar functional currency and the Group accounts are presented in the US dollar.
The assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
The income and expenses of the Company are translated using the monthly average rate.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation are taken to a separate equity translation reserve.
The Company holds monetary balances with its subsidiaries which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and thus this is considered to be part of the Company's net investment.
An exchange difference arises on translation in the Company profit and loss account.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs and stated at cost less impairment losses.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Where impairments have been recognised in previous periods and the condition giving rise to the impairment is determined to have reversed, the carrying value of the assets is assessed by reference to recoverable amount where the recoverable amount is calculated as the lower of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
On reversal of an impairment, carrying value is reinstated at a value not higher than the carrying value had the impairment not been made.
Impairment reversals are recorded in income in the period in which the reversal is made.
Share based payments The Group issues equitysettled sharebased payments to the directors and senior management.
Equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value in the Group is determined at the grant date of the equitysettled sharebased payments and is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each subsequent balance sheet date the Company calculates the estimated cumulative charge for each award having regard to any change in the number of options that are expected to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet relating to awards for services to subsidiaries is expensed in the income statement of those subsidiaries.
Once an option vests, no further adjustment is made to the aggregate amount expensed.
The corresponding entry is shown in equity in the Company.
The fair value which is calculated using the binomial model takes into account two performance criteria, being the actual increase in the Company's share price and a comparison of the actual increase in the share price to the change in FTSE FI until end of June 2004, the FTSE SI until end of February 2006 and the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index subsequent to that.
The expected life of the options depends on the behaviour of the option holders, which is incorporated into the option model consistent with historic data.
