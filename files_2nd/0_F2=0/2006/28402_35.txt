Prior year adjustment During 2006, IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions was issued and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
The company has elected to early adopt the interpretation which has resulted in a change in the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees of subsidiary companies in the company financial statements.
There is no impact on the group financial statements of the adoption of IFRIC 11.
Historically, the company accounted for share-based payment awards made to employees of the company only.
A charge was made to the income statement each year for the fair value of the awards made with a corresponding credit to the share-based payment reserve held within equity.
IFRIC 11 requires that share-based payment awards made by the company to employees of subsidiary companies should also be reflected in the financial statements of the company but as an increase in the investment in subsidiaries as opposed to a charge to the income statement with the corresponding credit being made to the share-based payment reserve within equity.
The adoption of IFRIC 11 has been treated as a change in accounting policy and prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.
There has been no impact on the income statement or retained earnings of the company.
The prior year restatement has increased the cost of investment in subsidiaries at 1 January 2005 by 1.2m, from 390.5m to 391.7m, increased 2005 additions to investment in subsidiaries by 2.1m, from 28.0m to 30.1m, and increased the cost of investments in subsidiaries at 31 December 2005 by 3.3m, from 418.5m to 421.8m.
The overall carrying value of investment in subsidiaries at 31 December 2005 has increased by 3.3m, from 386.5m to 389.8m.
The corresponding credits to each of the aforementioned adjustments have been made to the share-based payment reserve resulting in the 2005 closing share-based payment reserve increasing by 3.3m, from 1.9m to 5.2m.
2005 net assets have been increased by 3.3m, from 969.8m to 973.1m.
Had IFRIC 11 not been adopted in the 2006 financial statements, the disposal of investment in subsidiaries in 2006 would have been reduced by 0.7m, from 0.7m to nil, the cost of investment in subsidiaries at 31 December 2006 would have been reduced by 2.6m, from 431.2m to 428.6m, and the carrying value of investment in subsidiaries at 31 December 2006 would have been reduced by 2.6m, from 398.8m to 396.2m.
The share-based payment reserve at 31 December 2006 would have been reduced by 2.6m, from 3.3m to 0.7m.
