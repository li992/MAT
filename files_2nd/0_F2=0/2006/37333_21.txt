b Distinction between operating properties and investment properties A property is classied as an operating property rather than an investment property where the degree of ancillary services supplied is judged to be significant in the context of the arrangements between the landlord and tenant.
c Finance lease calculations In apportioning rentals on finance lease properties, the Group is required to estimate the split of the fair values of the properties concerned between land and buildings.
The inception of many of the Groups leases took place many years ago so that reliable estimates are very difficult to obtain.
Accordingly, the Group has had to apply its judgement in estimating the split at inception of certain finance lease properties.
d Trading properties Trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The latter is assessed by the Group having regard to suitable external advice and knowledge of recent comparable transactions.

Deferred tax on capitalised interest is also added back as this is effectively a permanent timing difference.

In accordance with IFRS1 First time adoption of International Reporting Standards and IAS 17 Leases, the Group has reviewed the classication of all leases at the opening balance sheet date of 1 April 2004.
In reviewing leases of land and buildings in accordance with IAS 17 the land and buildings elements of the lease need to be considered separately.
On this basis, leases on 43 properties entered into between 1923 and 2003 were reclassied as finance leases in these accounts.
This resulted in an increase in xed assets of 77.2m and a finance lease creditor of the same amount at first time adoption on 1 April 2004.
At 31 March 2006 leases on 34 properties entered into between 1936 and 2005 were classied as finance leases.
The corresponding increase in xed assets and finance lease creditor was 74.6m 2005: 69.6m.
Operating lease expense has reduced by 5.8m 2005: 5.4m.
The fair value of the Groups investment properties at 31 March 2006 has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out at that date by Knight Frank LLP, independent valuers.
The valuation, which conforms to International Valuation Standards, was arrived at by reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
Included within the property outsourcing operating and investment properties are investment properties with a market value of 27.1m 2005: 24.4m.
Fixed asset properties include capitalised interest of 115.8m 2005: 120.9m.
The average rate of capitalisation is 5.5% 2005: 6.8%.
The historical cost of investment properties is 6,265.5m 2005: 4,594.7m.
The current value of investment properties in respect of proposed developments is 383.8m 2005: 189.2m.
Developments are transferred out of the development programme when physically complete and 95% let.
Schemes completed during the year were Bexhill Retail Park: Whitefriars, Canterbury: Eastbourne Terrace, W2: and Summerland Gate, Exeter.

Goodwill 2006 2005 m m At beginning of year 34.3 34.3 Arising on acquisitions during the year note 32 64.5 12.7 Impaired during the year 64.5 12.7 At end of year 34.3 34.3 Represented by: Gross goodwill recognised 119.2 54.7 Total accumulated impairment losses 84.9 20.4 34.3 34.3 The goodwill carried in the Group balance sheet relates entirely to the Groups property outsourcing business, Land Securities Trillium, which is a cash-generating unit as dened in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
This goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill might be impaired.
Impairment is tested by comparing the carrying amount of the business assets and liabilities with its recoverable amount, being its value in use.
The latter is calculated by reference to the cash ow projections prepared annually by the business for its major contracts and covering the entire term of the contracts concerned but without assuming any renewals.
The main assumptions underlying the forecasts are the relative ination rates applying to costs and revenues and the amount of expenditure required for the business to full its service level commitments.
The cash ows are discounted at a rate reecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the business.
The discount rate used for the 2006 test was 8.5%.
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of Tops Estates PLC.
The fair value exercise gave rise to goodwill of 64.5m.
Similarly, during the prior year the Group acquired a retail property portfolio from Slough Estates plc.
The fair value exercise gave rise to goodwill of 12.7m.
The goodwill arises primarily from the difference between how deferred tax is calculated for accounting purposes and the value ascribed to it in negotiations.
The former is based on the difference between the values of the assets and liabilities concerned for accounts purposes and those applying for taxation.
The latter is based on tax payments likely to be made.
In the Groups opinion, the carrying amount of this goodwill cannot be justied by reference to future cash ows and it has accordingly been impaired.

Deferred income principally relates to rents received in advance.
Borrowings continued All borrowings are denominated in Sterling.
On 3 November 2004 a debt renancing was completed resulting in the Group exchanging all of its outstanding bond and debenture debt for new Notes.
The new Notes do not meet the IAS 39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new Notes is reduced to the book value of the original debt the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment.
The adjustment will be amortised to zero over the life of the new Notes.
The Notes and the committed bank facilities are secured on a xed and oating pool of assets the Security Group.
This grants the Groups investors security over a pool of investment properties valued at 9.4bn at 31 March 2006 2005: 7.4bn.
The secured debt structure has a tiered covenant regime which gives the Group substantial operational exibility when the loan to value and interest rate cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively.
If these limits are exceeded, operational restrictions increase signicantly and could act as an incentive to reduce gearing.
The acquisition loan notes were issued by Retail Property Holdings Trust Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, as partial consideration for the purchase of Tops Estates PLC and the LxB portfolio.
The notes are unsecured, however, they have the benefit of a commercial bank guarantee.
Interest is calculated with reference to six month LIBOR.
The DWP term loan is a syndicated term loan due to expire in December 2017 and is secured on the freehold and long leasehold properties acquired from the Department of Work and Pensions.
The carrying amount of the properties concerned was 388.1m at 31 March 2006 2005: 389.4m.
The Group had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional principal of 615.0m 2005: 250.0m which do not qualify for hedge accounting and which terminate over the period 2007 to 2011.
The contracts have xed interest payments at an average rate of 4.9% and have oating interest receipts at LIBOR.
In addition, there were interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional principal of 243.2m 2005: 245.9m which qualify for hedge accounting and which terminate over the period 2009 to 2017.
The contracts have xed interest payments at an average rate of 5.1% and have oating interest receipts at LIBOR.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts are assumed to approximate to their book values, as are the values of longer-term, oating rate bank loans.
The Groups Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.

Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations and debt nancing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates.
Interest rate risk The Group uses interest rate swaps and similar instruments forward rate agreements, forward starting swaps, etc to manage its interest rate exposure.
With property and interest rate cycles typically of four to seven years duration, the Groups target is to have a minimum of 80% of anticipated debt at xed rates of interest and 20% oating over this timeframe.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Land Securities Annual Report 2006 121 Notes to the financial statements continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and short-term investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited due to the Groups policy of monitoring counterparty exposures.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned future investments.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is a designated cash ow hedging instrument.
In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument which shows that the hedge will be effective on an ongoing basis.
The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each year end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Gains or losses on cash ow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecasted transaction results in a financial asset or liability only, gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassied to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where the forecasted transaction results in a non-financial asset or liability, gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the cost of the related asset or liability.
If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
Ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised in profit or loss as they arise.
For the portion of hedges deemed ineffective or transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the income statement when the forecasted or committed transaction is recognised in the income statement.
However, where cash ow hedge accounting has been applied for a forecasted or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss recorded in equity is transferred to the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted hedged transaction itself is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Pension benets Dened benefit schemes Land Securities Scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is the most significant dened benefit pension scheme of the Group.
The Scheme is a wholly funded scheme, and the assets of the Scheme are held in a self-administered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualied independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected unit method, as members approach retirement.
Contributory money purchase scheme A contributory money purchase scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
A further separate similar scheme, previously set up by Trillium, is also in operation for Land Securities Trillium employees.
Pension costs for dened contribution schemes are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Dened contribution schemes 1.7 0.9 All death-in-service and benets for incapacity arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post retirement benets other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.

Pension benets continued A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 1 July 2005 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson Consultants & Actuaries.
This valuation, and the latest formal valuation of the Trillium Plan, were updated to 31 March 2006.
The major assumptions used in this valuation, were in nominal terms : 2006 2005 %% # Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.25 4.25 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00 3.00 Discount rate 4.90 5.40 Ination 3.00 3.00 Expected return on plan assets 5.90 5.90 # plus an allowance of 1.25% per annum for promotional salary increases in respect of employee members of the Trillium Plan plus an allowance of 1% per annum for promotional salary increases in respect of employee members of the Land Securities Scheme The expected return on plan assets is based on expectations for bonds and equities.
At the year end, the expected return on bonds is based on market yields of long dated bonds at that date.
The estimated expected return on equities includes an additional equity risk premium.
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: 2006 2005 years years Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners Men 26.6 23.2 Women 29.5 26.2 Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners current age 40 Men 27.8 26.5 Women 30.6 29.4 The fair value of the assets in the Schemes including annuities purchased to provide certain pensions in payment and the expected rate of return net of investment management expenses were: 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 %% % m m m Equities 7.50 7.50 7.50 64.1 48.7 42.9 Bonds and insurance contracts 4.60 5.00 5.00 82.9 62.3 58.8 Other 4.50 4.75 4.00 3.0 14.7 2.9 Fair value of schemes assets 150.0 125.7 104.6 Present value of schemes liabilities 156.5 136.6 121.8 deficit in the schemes 6.5 10.9 17.2 Related deferred tax asset 2.0 3.3 5.2 Net pension liability 4.5 7.6 12.0 The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2006 2005 %% Equities 43 39 Bonds and insurance contracts 55 50 Other 2 11 The plan assets do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by Land Securities Group PLC.

Share-based payments The Groups share-based payments are all equity-settled and comprise the Savings Related Share Option Schemes Sharesave, various Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, Performance and Deferred Bonus share schemes related to the annual bonus scheme, and the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares or options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes Under the 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme all staff who have been with the Group for a continuous period of not less than six months are eligible to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave scheme operated by Lloyds TSB Bank Plc.
On completion of the three, five or seven year contract period ordinary shares in Land Securities Group PLC may be purchased at a price based upon the current market price at date of invitation less 20% discount.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the scheme before the options vest or lapse if options are not exercised within six months of the bonus date.
In certain circumstances leavers may exercise their options early based upon current savings.
Alternatively, they may continue saving to receive the tax-free bonus at the end of the contract or withdraw their cash immediately.
Fair value calculations assume a lapse rate, based upon historic values, of approximately 20% for employees leaving the Group before vesting.

In addition, an award of matching shares can be made, linked to co-investment in shares by participants.
The employees investment can be made through deferral of an annual bonus award and or through optional pledging of shares purchased in the market.
The maximum level of matching is shares with a face value of 50% of salary for Executive Directors and 25% of salary for senior executives.

Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares and or transfer of treasury shares and or transfer of shares other than treasury shares.

Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS The Groups transition date for the adoption of IFRS is 1 April 2004.
This transition date has been selected in accordance with IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Group has also adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 April 2004.
The principal differences for the Group between reporting under IFRS as compared to UK GAAP as at 31 March 2005 are: i Recognising revaluation surpluses and deficits in the income statement ii Providing in full for deferred tax on revaluations and charging movements on this provision through the income statement iii Restating the financial effects of the November 2004 debt renancing iv Showing the Groups share of the profit after tax and net assets of all its joint ventures and joint arrangements as single lines in the income statement and balance sheet respectively v Ceasing to amortise goodwill but instead testing for impairment vi No longer recognising dividends payable to shareholders prior to their approval by the Annual General Meeting in the case of the final dividend and by the Board in the case of the interim dividend The application of IFRS has also changed the presentation of the cash ow statement which now shows cash ows derived from three types of activities operating, investing and nancing.
In addition, under IFRS, the cash ow statement includes all cash ows in respect of cash and cash equivalents.
This is a broader denition of cash than under UK GAAP.
As a general rule, the Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies for the year ended 31 March 2006 and apply these retrospectively to determine its opening IFRS balance sheet at the transition date of 1 April 2004 and the comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2005.
However, advantage has been taken of certain exemptions afforded by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards as follows: Business combinations prior to 1 April 2004 The Group has applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to awards made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 Presentation of a five year history of experience gains and losses as required by IAS 19 Employee Benets.
A four year history has been presented Land Securities Annual Report 2006 135 Notes to the financial statements continued 35.
Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS continued In preparing the IFRS accounts, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in the financial statements prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition has affected the Groups financial performance and position is set out in the following tables and accompanying narrative.

Adjustment to UK GAAP as at 31 March 2005, most of which would no longer be required under UK GAAP following the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement benets and FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date.
Notes i Deferred tax is required to be provided in full on all differences between carrying values for accounts purposes and those for taxation.
In particular, deferred tax is now provided on revaluation surpluses.
ii Dividends are now only provided when nally approved, either by the Annual General Meeting in the case of final dividends or by the Board for interim dividends.
iii The actuarial deficit in the Groups dened benefit pension schemes is now recognised as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet.
iv Tenant leases which transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the tenant are treated as finance leases.
The property is fide-recognised from the balance sheet and a receivable recognised in its place.
v The cost of tenant lease incentives, such as rent free periods, are now amortised over the term of the leases concerned rather than over the period to the first review to market rents.
vi The fair value of all derivatives such as interest rate swaps is now recognised in the Group balance sheet at each reporting date.
vii Goodwill arising on acquisition is no longer amortised but kept on the balance sheet and reviewed regularly for impairment.
viii The cost of share based payments is now recognised through the income statement.
ix Joint ventures cease to be consolidated once their net assets become negative.
This is the case with Telereal during the year under review.
x The bond exchange which took place in November 2004 qualied as an extinguishment of the existing debt and an issue of new debt under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, this is not the case and the existing debt is reinstated with the difference in redemption amounts being amortised over the life of the new debt.

xi The surpluses and deficits arising on the periodic revaluation of the investment property portfolio are now taken through the income statement.
xii Deferred tax is provided in full on the revaluation surpluses and deficits and taken through the income statement.
xiii Deferred tax provided on revaluation surpluses does not become payable on disposal of the properties concerned and so has to be written back through the income statement.
