32 Transition to IFRS As stated in the Group significant Accounting Policies, these are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash ows is set out on the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.

Consequently, goodwill amortisation of 9.4m that was previously charged is now removed from the administrative costs within the income statement for the year ending 31 March 2005 and intangible assets are increased by 9.4m at 31 March 2005. b Under IFRS, computer software is treated as an intangible asset when the software is not an integral part of the related hardware.
This means application software costs that have been capitalised as tangible xed assets must now be reclassied to intangible assets.
The effect is to increase the intangible xed assets and reduce tangible xed assets by 44.6m at 1 April 2004 and 53.0m at 31 March 2005. c Under IAS 17, land and buildings currently held on the balance sheet under finance leases are required to be split to determine how much relates to land and how much to buildings so that the land element can be reclassied to operating leases.
The Group includes two such leases and, therefore, 1.9m has been reclassied from tangible xed assets to receivables at 1 April 2004 and 1.8m at 31 March 2005. d Under IFRS, receivables due after more than one year are disclosed separately from receivables due within one year on the face of the balance sheet.
The effect is to reclassify 0.9m at 1 April 2004 and 5.1m at 31 March 2005. e Under UK GAAP, the cost of providing pension benets was charged against the operating profit over the period during which the Group expected to benefit from the employees services.
The application of SSAP 24 resulted in prepayments of 1.2m at 1 April 2004 and 4.1m at 31 March 2005, and these are reversed as a result of the adoption of IAS 19.
The change in the methodology of calculating the income statement charge reduced operating profit by 2.1m in the year ended 31 March 2005.
Similarly, liabilities previously disclosed within creditors are now also disclosed within retirement benets.
The effect is to reduce payables and increase retirement benefit obligations by 2.5m at 1 April 2004 and 2.9m at 31 March 2005.
IAS 19 requires that the Groups pension deficits be recorded as balance sheet liabilities.
The impact is that total deficits of 48.2m at 1 April 2004 and 47.0m at 31 March 2005 are disclosed on the balance sheet.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 47 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 32 Transition to IFRS continued Notes to the reconciliation of equity continued f Under UK GAAP, for an investment to qualify as cash, it needed to have a maturity of less than one day.
Under IAS 7 Cash ow statements, for an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent it qualies when it has a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
The Group has reclassied deposits with a maturity of less than three months but more than one day from current asset investments to cash and cash equivalents.
The overall impact is to reclassify 65.4m from investments to cash at 1 April 2004 and 53.6m at 31 March 2005. g Under UK GAAP, the provisioning for short term employee benets is covered under FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
One of the requirements for a provision is that a transfer of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and the transfer of economic benets has normally involved the payment of money.
Thus, no provision has been made, in past years, for holiday pay as the amount of any outstanding holiday pay that is likely to be paid in cash is small.
IAS 19 requires that when an employee has rendered service to an enterprise, the enterprise should recognise the undiscounted amount of the short term benets expected to be paid in exchange for that service as either a liability or an expense.
Under IFRS, an enterprise must accrue for that extra work done by an employee, for instance, where a holiday allowance is permitted but not taken.
Consequently the Group has now included an accrual for accumulating holiday pay and sick pay where relevant.
The accrual at both 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 is 3.7m and the income statement charge for the year ending 31 March 2005 is nil.
h Under IFRS, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are to be treated as non-adjusting events and therefore disclosed in the year in which they are agreed rather than the year to which they relate.
The effect is to reduce payables and increase reserves by 54.8m at both 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005. i Under IFRS, the tax payable must be disclosed separately on the balance sheet.
Consequently, the payables have been reduced and the tax payable increased by 21.9m and 18.7m at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 respectively.
Under IFRS, a tax receivable must be shown separately.
Therefore there are adjustments to increase the tax receivable and reduce trade receivables by 2.0m at 1 April 2004 and 2.2m at 31 March 2005. j Under IFRS, financial liabilities must be disclosed separately on the balance sheet.
Consequently, the payables due within one year have been reduced and the financial liabilities due within one year increased by 24.9m and 27.7m at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 respectively.
Similarly, the payables due after more than one year have been reduced and the financial liabilities due after more than one year increased by 82.9m and 92.5m at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 respectively.
k The above changes increased decreased the deferred tax liability as follows: 1 April 31 March 2004 2005 Note m m Deferred tax liability UK GAAP 11.6 14.3 IFRS adjustments: Deferred tax on pension deficit e 13.8 14.6 Deferred tax on holiday pay accrual g 0.9 0.9 Increase in deferred tax charge on goodwill a 3.4 Deferred tax on share based payments l 0.5 1.3 Gross up deferred tax assets and liabilities k 19.2 17.4 Other 0.2 0.6 Deferred tax liability IFRS 15.8 18.9 Under IFRS, a deferred tax asset must be shown separately from a deferred tax liability.
Therefore there are adjustments to increase the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability by 19.2m at 1 April 2004 and 17.4m at 31 March 2005.
The effect on the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 was to increase the previously reported tax charge by 2.0m to 32.3m.
l IFRS 2 requires that the fair value of share options be charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
Fair values per share have been calculated for options granted since 7 November 2002.
These have then been charged to the income statement over their respective vesting periods.
The charge for these share-based payments was 2.4m for the year ended 31 March 2005.
This charge includes the Long Term Incentive Option Plan options issued in July 2003 and July 2004.
The charge for the year ended 31 March 2006 also includes the impact of the options issued in July 2005. m IFRS requires translation differences on the revaluation of the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries to be taken directly to reserves.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, the value of translation differences is 1.5m.
