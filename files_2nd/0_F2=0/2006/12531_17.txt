The change in the weighted average rate year on year relates to the mix of profit and loss in each jurisdiction.
The effective tax rate for UK ring fence profits rose from 40 per cent to 50 per cent following a rise in the supplementary corporation tax rate which took effect on 1 January 2006.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The amount of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet in the absence of suitable forecast profits is US$56.2 million in the UK 2005: US$169 milllion.
This gives rise to a potential deferred tax asset of US$16.9 million.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial statements 7 Discontinued operations 51 In December 2006, management decided to dispose of the groups Mauritanian operations and negotiations with several interested parties have subsequently taken place.
These operations, which are expected to be sold within 12 months, have been classified as a disposal group held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet.
The results of the discontinued operations which have been included in the consolidated income statement, were as follows: 2006 2005 $ million $ million Revenue 43.4 Expenses 51.5 1.2 Loss before tax 8.1 1.2 Attributable tax expense 2.3 0.3 10.4 0.9 Loss on assets classified as held for sale 8.1 Net loss for the year from assets held for sale 18.5 0.9 During the year, the Mauritanian assets contributed US$22.3 million 2005: US$nil to the groups net operating cash flows, and paid US$17.8 million 2005: US$59.0 million in respect of investing activities.
A loss of US$8.1 million arose on the recategorisation of the Mauritanian assets as a held for sale group, being the difference between the fair values less cost to sell of the disposal group and the carrying values of its net assets.
The effect of discontinued operations on segment results is disclosed in note 1.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classified as held for sale are as follows: 2006 $ million Intangible exploration and evaluation assets 16.2 Property, plant and equipment 65.3 Investments in associates 0.1 Trade and other receivables 8.8 Total assets classified as held for sale 90.4 Trade and other payables 5.4 Long-term provisions 7.2 Deferred tax liabilities 1.6 Total liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale 14.2 Net assets of disposal group 76.2 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 52 8 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
The diluted earnings per share allows for the full exercise of outstanding share purchase options and adjusted earnings.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Weighted average Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 $ million $ million million million cents cents From continuing operations: Basic 86.1 39.5 81.8 82.1 105.3 48.1 Outstanding share options 0.9 0.7 Diluted 86.1 39.5 82.7 82.8 104.1 47.7 From continuing and discontinued operations: Basic 67.6 38.6 81.8 82.1 82.6 47.0 Outstanding share options 0.9 0.7 Diluted 67.6 38.6 82.7 82.8 81.7 46.6 The inclusion of the outstanding share options in the 2006 and 2005 calculations produce a diluted earnings per share.
The outstanding share options number includes any expected additional share issues due to future share-based payments.

These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.

Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 20 on pages 60 to 62.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, West Africa and Pakistan oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2036.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
18 Financial instruments The groups activities expose it to financial risks of changes, primarily in oil and gas prices but also foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
Premier undertakes oil and gas price hedging periodically within Board limits to protect operating cash flow against weak prices.
Oil and gas hedging is mostly undertaken with collar options and to a lesser extent with swaps.
During the year the group entered into further options which enhanced existing coverage.
This resulted in forecast production being hedged as follows: a Oil production: approximately 50 per cent of its forecasted production from 2007 to the end of 2012 with Dated Brent oil price options with an average floor price of US$38.9 bbl and a cap price of US$100.0 bbl.
b Gas production: approximately 34 per cent of the Indonesian gas production, for which HSFO Singapore 180cst is the variable component from 2007 to the end of June 2012 at a floor price of US$245.0 mt and a ceiling price of US$500.0 mt.
c No premium was paid in the year for either oil or gas production and no swaps were entered into.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 58 18 Financial instruments continued The fair value of the above oil hedges is a liability of US$0.8 million and of the gas hedges is an asset of US$0.5 million each of which is recognised in the balance sheet in trade and other payables receivables.
While the above hedges were assessed to be effective, all the movements in the fair values have been recognised in the income statement, as all such movements relate to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.
The fair value of the above hedges have been determined from the bank counterparties with whom the hedges have been concluded.
During the year, oil and gas hedges entered into in previous years matured, generating no profit or loss 2005: loss of US$15.7 million all of which was offset against sales revenue.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the group as at 31 December was: Fixed rate weighted average Fixed rate Floating rate Total interest rate Currency $ million $ million $ million % 2006: US$ Total 2005: US$ 65.0 65.0 Total 65.0 65.0 The 2005 carrying value on the balance sheet is stated net of the unamortised portion of debt arrangement fees of US$1.4 million.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest at rates set by reference to US$ LIBOR, exposing the group to a cash flow interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the group as at 31 December was: Floating rate Interest free Total $ million $ million $ million 2006 Cash and short-term deposits: Sterling 0.5 0.5 US$ 25.2 8.3 33.5 Other 5.6 1.3 6.9 Total 31.3 9.6 40.9 2005 Cash and short-term deposits: Sterling 0.7 0.7 US$ 30.2 6.8 37.0 Other 1.1 1.1 Total 30.9 7.9 38.8 The floating rate cash and short-term deposits consist of cash held in interest-bearing current accounts and deposits placed on the money markets for periods ranging from overnight to three months.

Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Values recorded will not necessarily be realised.
Non-interest bearing financial instruments, which include accounts receivable from customers, and accounts payable are recorded materially at fair value reflecting their short-term maturity and are not shown in the above table.
Credit risk The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables which were immaterial in 2006.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Currency risk Some US$ Sterling exposures were hedged with forward contracts during the year which were not material.
Premiers activities are largely conducted in US$.
All borrowings at the year-end were denominated in US$ to match the currency of the assets.

Asset and Equity Plan The company currently operates an Asset and Equity Plan to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period.
The plan has two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 28 to 37.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility 29.0% to 34.0% Risk free rate on interest 4.1% to 5.0% Historic market value growth factor 91.0% to 233.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 62 20 Share capital continued For the year ended 31 December 2006, the total cost recognised by the company for share-based payments is US$26.4 million 2005: US$6.4 million, with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$26.7 million 2005: US$2.9 million and a cost of US$5.0 million recorded in equity 2005: US$2.9 million.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the timewriting system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as projects directly attributable to capital and part is charged to the income statement as exploration write off, operating costs, pre-licence expenditure or general and administration costs.

The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The pension cost for the Scheme is determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2005 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 6.5 per cent pa, salary growth: 4.8 per cent pa and pension increases: 2.8 per cent pa.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 9.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted, the assets covered 93 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on the projected pensionable salaries.
During 2006, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 19 per cent of the pensionable salaries together with 317,000 paid in monthly instalments: in addition, the employer paid a lump sum contribution of 1,220,000 in March 2006.
Aside from any further lump sum contribution, the employer expects to contribute 416,000 to the Scheme in 2007.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2006 but taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2007.
The benefit obligations and service costs have been measured using the projected unit credit method and the pension expense has been assessed on the basis that the group adopts the policy of fully recognising actuarial gains and losses during the period in which they arise.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2006 2005 % pa % pa Discount rate 5.2 4.8 Salary growth 5.1 4.9 Return on assets 6.0 5.5 Price inflation 3.1 2.9 Pension increases 3.1 2.9 Defined benefit obligations and assets: 2006 2005 $ million $ million Value of funded benefit obligation 31.4 28.1 Less fair value of scheme assets 28.0 21.1 Liability in balance sheet 3.4 7.0 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial statements 25 Group pension schemes continued 65 Pension expense: 2006 2005 $ million $ million Service costs 0.4 0.3 Interest costs 1.4 1.3 Expected return on scheme assets 1.3 1.1 Investment gains losses 0.2 1.6 Actuarial gains losses 1.6 4.9 Total pension expense in the year 1.3 3.8 A total of US$1.5 million 2005: US$2.4 million was recognised directly in equity during the year.

In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2006 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of unfunded pensions is US$1.0 million 2005: US$0.9 million.
A total of US$0.1 million 2005: US$0.2 million was recognised directly in equity during the year.
