Intangible assets are allocated to cash generating units and a discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of each business, as discussed in the Business Review.
The analysis is based on forecast cash flows, with zero growth used to determine terminal values.
The estimated cash flows are discounted using Filtronas weighted average cost of capital and any impairments identified are charged to the income statement.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.

Fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by discounting cash flows at the rates of interest prevailing at the year end.
Fair values of other financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying amounts in 2006 and 2005.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur over the next 12 months.
With the exception of the interest rate swaps discussed in note 13 all other derivative instruments mature within the next 12 months.
Filtrona has US dollar denominated borrowings and US dollar and euro currency swaps which it has designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings.

Non-current provisions are generally long-term in nature with the timing of utilisation uncertain.
Employee benefits Post-retirement benefits For the period prior to demerger Filtrona employees were members of the former parent companys defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The liabilities and assets of these schemes were transferred to successor Filtrona schemes following demerger.
Liabilities were actuarially allocated between Filtrona and the former parent company and scheme assets were split in the same proportion as liabilities.
Under IAS 19 revised Filtrona had to account for defined benefit pension costs up to the period of demerger on a defined contribution basis and on a defined benefit basis thereafter.
Accordingly, Filtrona recognised the retirement benefit obligation of 34.7m at demerger in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2006 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Defined benefit contributions in 2007 are expected to be 5.9m, which consists of payments to fund future service accruals and contributions to amortise the deficit in respect of past service.

Acquisitions In May 2006 Filtrona purchased certain assets and the business of the CSL Digital Print division of CORGI Services Limited and, concurrently, entered into a five year agreement with CORGI Group Limited for the exclusive supply of registered gas installer identity cards.
In December 2005 Filtrona purchased an additional 30% of FractureCode Corporation ApS FractureCode, taking Filtronas share in FractureCode to 80%.
FractureCode was previously accounted for as a joint venture using equity accounting.
Following the purchase it is now fully consolidated and contributed nil to operating profit before intangible amortisation in 2005.
The remaining 20% of shares in FractureCode could be acquired between March 2009 and December 2012.
The consideration for the remaining 20% of shares is dependent on various profit related targets with a minimum consideration payable of 3.1m and a maximum of 40m.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Filtrona.
The fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The principal fair value adjustments are as follows: In 2006: There were no adjustments to the book value of assets and liabilities acquired.
In 2005: The adjustment to intangibles represents the write-off of goodwill in the entity on acquisition in accordance with IAS 38: Intangible Assets.
The adjustment to investment in associate and minority interest reflects the change from equity accounting to full consolidation.
