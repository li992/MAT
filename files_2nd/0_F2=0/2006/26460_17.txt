NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Up until 31 March 2005, London Stock Exchange plc the Group prepared its financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
From 1 April 2005 the Group consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The impact of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS on the Groups total equity at 1 April 2004 date of transition to IFRS and 31 March 2005 is set out in note 33.
In addition, a reconciliation is provided between profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2005 under UK GAAP and IFRS.
The comparative data disclosed in these financial statements has been restated on an IFRS basis.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and on the basis of the principal accounting policies set out below.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, all having co-terminous accounting periods, with all inter-company balances and transactions eliminated.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the holding companys income statement has not been included in these financial statements.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE Revenue represents the total amount receivable for the provision of goods and services, excluding value added tax.
Revenue is recognised in the period when the service or supply is provided: a annual fees are recognised over the 12 month period to which the fee relates: b admission fees are recognised at the time of admission to trading: and c data, transaction and Exchange charges are recognised in the month in which the data is provided or the transaction is effected.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Items of income and expense that are material by size and or nature and are non-recurring are classified as exceptional items on the face of the income statement within their relevant category.
The separate reporting of these items helps give an indication of the Groups underlying performance.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentation and functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies and currency balances at the year end are converted at the rate ruling at the transaction date or year end date respectively, with any gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS a Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of consideration paid over the identifiable fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
b Third party software costs for the development and implementation of systems which enhance the services provided by the Group are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is an average of three years.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT a Freehold properties, including related fixed plant, are included in the financial statements at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Freehold buildings and related fixed plant are depreciated to residual value, based on cost at the beginning of the year plus subsequent additions, over their estimated economic lives.
The estimated useful lives of properties are approximately 50 years, the estimated useful lives of fixed plant range from five to 20 years.
b Leasehold properties and improvements are included at cost and depreciated to residual value over the shorter of the period of the lease or the economic life of the asset.
c Plant and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated to residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are mainly in the range from three to five years.
d The Group selects its depreciation rates based on expected economic lives, taking into account the expected rate of technological developments, market requirements and expected use of the assets.
The selected rates are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate to the Groups circumstances.
Residual values and economic lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
JOINT VENTURES Investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups share of profits or losses after tax from joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement.
Cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment in the Groups balance sheet.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for in the Companys financial statements at cost.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for in the Companys financial statements at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash at bank and term deposits that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
43 LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNUAL REPORT 2006 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS a Investments other than fixed deposits and interests in joint ventures and subsidiaries are designated as available for sale and are recorded on trade date at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in equity.
Where the fair value is not reliably measurable, the investment is held at cost.
b Foreign currency derivatives are recorded at fair value.
The method of recording gains or losses depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item hedged.
Where they meet the relevant criteria in IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the Group designates foreign currency derivatives as cash flow hedges with the movement in fair value recognised in equity.
Amounts recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
c The Companys own shares held by the ESOP trust are deducted from equity until they vest unconditionally in employees.
d Consideration paid in respect of Treasury shares is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
PROVISIONS A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
OPERATING LEASES Rental costs for operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis.
Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Provision is made in the accounts for lease commitments, less income from sub-letting, for property space which is surplus to business requirements.
Such provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered material.
PENSION COSTS The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
For the defined benefit scheme the service cost, representing benefits accruing to employees, is included as an operating expense and the expected return on scheme assets and interest cost from unwinding of the discount on scheme obligations are included as finance income and finance costs respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between actual and expected returns on assets are recognised at each period end net of tax in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The net asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of pension obligations and the fair value of scheme assets.
For defined contribution schemes, the expense is charged to the income statement as incurred.
DEFERRED TAXATION Full provision is made, using the liability method, for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation is determined using tax rates that are substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or liability settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that they will be recoverable against future taxable profits.
SHARE BASED COMPENSATION The Group operates a number of equity settled share based compensation plans for employees.
The charge to the income statement is determined by the fair value of the options granted or shares awarded at the date of grant and recognised over the relevant vesting period.
IFRS 1 TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS The following exemptions have been applied to the financial statements: a Business combinations The Group has chosen not to restate business combinations prior to the transition date, 1 April 2004: b Fair value or revaluation at deemed cost The Group has chosen to restate freehold properties, other than the Stock Exchange Tower which has since been sold, to fair value as deemed cost at the transition date: c Employee benefits The Group has chosen to recognise all cumulative pension scheme actuarial gains and losses in equity at the transition date: and d Share based payments The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 2 Share-based payments to awards granted after 7 November 2002.
44 LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNUAL REPORT 2006 2.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES Judgements and estimates are regularly evaluated based on historical experience, current circumstances and expectations of future events.
The critical judgements and estimates made in the preparation of the financial statements set out below are made in accordance with the appropriate IFRS and the Groups accounting policy.
The resulting accounting estimate may not equal the related actual result.
a The determination of the defined benefit pension liability is based on the present value of future pension obligations using assumptions determined by the Group with advice from an independent qualified actuary: b The property provision is determined taking into consideration future expected receipts from sub-letting and future property costs based on advice from independent property advisers: c Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The recoverable amounts of relevant cash generating units are based on value in use calculations using managements best estimate of future business performance: and d Significant estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for the estimated tax charge at the period end and where the final tax liability is different from that estimate, such differences are reflected in the period in which such determination is made.

As part of that review, the future business plan for EDX London Ltd was considered, taking account of i developments to date in EDX London Ltds business: ii managements assessment of current market requirements and future developments: and iii managements view that the new overthe-counter clearing service does not justify further investment.
The business plan covered the next five years with a growth rate of 2.25 per cent beyond that and cash flows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13 per cent.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets in respect of EDX London Ltd was not supported by the estimated net present value of future cash flows and, accordingly, an exceptional impairment loss of 19.7m has been recognised.
An exceptional impairment loss of 0.3m was also identified in respect of plant and equipment see note 11.
The carrying value of goodwill and other assets in respect of Proquote was supported by the estimated net present value of future cash flows in the business plan over the next five years, with a growth rate of 2.25 per cent beyond that and cash flows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13 per cent.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates separate defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The assets of the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are held separately from those of the Group and the funds are primarily managed by Schroder Investment Management Limited and Legal & General Investment Management Limited respectively.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME The defined benefit scheme is non-contributory and provides benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Pension scheme obligations and costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on a regular basis using the projected unit credit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2003 by an independent qualified actuary.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The majority of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are based in sterling with some exposure to Scandinavian currencies in Derivatives Services which are mainly hedged by forward exchange contracts.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are in respect of interest rate, credit, liquidity and exchange rate.
INTEREST RATE RISK There are no floating rate financial assets.
Term deposits with banks are for fixed rates for the period of the deposit.
Interest on the loan from the minority shareholder is determined with reference to LIBOR.
No hedging of interest rates on floating rate financial liabilities took place during the year.
LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK The Group manages liquidity risk by depositing funds available for investment in approved instruments for periods up to one year.
Counterparty risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents is managed by establishing minimum credit worthiness limits and limiting the maximum exposure to each counterparty.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers.
EXCHANGE RATE RISK The only derivative contracts used during the year were forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast cash inflows in Scandinavian currencies and were designated as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
All contracts were closed out on or before the final contract dates and fully matched with equivalent currency cash holdings.
At the year end, forward contracts were held for forecast currency cash flows in the coming year.
The fair value of these contracts at 31 March 2006 amounted to nil 2005: nil.
The fair and carrying values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Group Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2006 2006 2005 2005 m m m m Short term investments term deposits and cash 226.8 226.8 124.4 124.4 Loan from minority shareholder within one year 0.6 0.6 2.8 2.8 after more than one year 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 225.7 225.7 121.1 121.1 Company Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2006 2006 2005 2005 m m m m Investments term deposits and cash 219.8 219.8 118.8 118.8 Available for sale financial assets, representing the Groups 0.6 per cent interest in the ordinary shares of Euroclear plc, are measured at cost of 0.4m.
The fair value of these shares cannot be measured reliably because they are unquoted.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using a valuation technique with reference to observable market interest rates.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables are reasonable approximations of fair value.
The fair value of borrowings are based on discounted cash flows using a rate based on borrowing cost.

SHARE SCHEMES A new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was approved at the 2004 AGM and introduced in 2004.
This scheme has two elements, a conditional award of Performance Shares and an award of Matching Shares linked to investment by the executive of annual bonus in the Exchanges shares.
Vesting of these awards is dependent upon the Companys total shareholder return performance.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 35.
Under the Companys previous share option plan approved by shareholders in 2002, the maximum value of shares placed under option to an individual was equivalent to 100 per cent of their annual salary.
No further awards will be made under this scheme.
Prior to 2002, under the previous long term incentive scheme comprising the Initial and Annual Share Plans option grants and share awards were made based on approvals prior to the Companys listing in July 2001.
No further option grants or share awards will be made under this scheme apart from the SAYE scheme available to all staff.
Under both the Initial and Annual Share Plan, share awards have a vesting period of three years and share options become exercisable at 20 per cent per annum over five years with a contractual life of 10 years.
The SAYE scheme provides for grants of options to employees who enter into a SAYE savings contract and options were granted at 20 per cent below fair market value.
Share awards were granted at nil cost to employees and share options were granted at fair market value or above.
The Company established an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire the Companys shares to meet commitments to employees.
At the year end 428,529 2005: 878,694 shares were held by the trust, funded by an interest free loan from the Company.
In accordance with SIC-12 the assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP trust have been included in the Groups financial statements and the cost of the Companys shares held by the trust are deducted from retained earnings.

POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT In May 2006 London Stock Exchange Group plc Exchange Group became the holding company of the Company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement.
Under the scheme Exchange Group issued new ordinary shares and B shares to the Companys shareholders.
Shortly after the scheme, the nominal value of Exchange Groups new ordinary shares was reduced and the merger reserve created by the scheme was capitalised and subsequently cancelled, creating sufficient distributable reserves of London Stock Exchange Group plc sufficient to enable the return of approximately 510 million to shareholders.
The B shares were issued as the mechanism to facilitate the capital return.
Payments to holders of B shares who had not elected to defer payment of their entitlements will be made on 26 May 2006.
The capital return has been funded by a combination of existing cash reserves and new loan facilities to Exchange Group of 450 million, of which 350 million has been drawn down.

TRANSITION DISCLOSURES Set out below are reconciliations between UK GAAP and IFRS for total equity at 1 April 2004 date of transition to IFRS and 31 March 2005.
In addition, a reconciliation is provided between Group profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2005 under UK GAAP and IFRS.
Profit for the Company for the financial year ended 31 March 2005 increased by 1.6m to 57.7m 56.1m under UK GAAP.

The charge to the income statement is the current periods service charge and a financing charge for unwinding the discount applied to obligations and the expected return on pension scheme assets.
The impact on the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 is to increase operating profit by 2.7m and reduce net finance income by 0.5m.
After the associated tax there is an increase in profit attributable to equity holders for the year of 1.5m.
The impact on the balance sheet is to reduce total equity for the Group and Company at 31 March 2005 by 23.2m 1 April 2004: 22.9m.
b IAS 16 Freehold properties Under the transitional arrangements set out in IFRS 1 the Group has elected to restate freehold properties other than the Stock Exchange Tower to their fair value at the date of transition, resulting in a reduction in the balance sheet carrying amount.
This lower carrying amount, together with the requirement to update residual values to reflect current prices, has the effect of reducing depreciation compared with UK GAAP.
The impact on the income statement is to reduce the depreciation charge in respect of remaining freehold properties for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 1.7m.
In relation to the Stock Exchange Tower, there is a reduction in depreciation charge and corresponding reduction to the profit on sale of the Tower of 0.5m.
After the associated tax there is an increase in profit attributable to equity holders for the year of 1.4m.
For the Group and Company, total equity is 5.2m lower at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004: 6.6m as a result of the restated values of freehold properties as at 1 April 2004, partly offset by the lower depreciation charge in the year ended 31 March 2005. c IAS 17 Leases All leases have been reviewed and remain as operating leases.
Lease incentives under IFRS are spread over the term of the lease, whereas, under UK GAAP they were spread over the period to the first rent review.
This results in an increased charge to the income statement and consequent higher balance sheet accrual.
The impact on the income statement is to reduce operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 1.3m.
After the associated tax there is a reduction in profit attributable to equity holders for the year of 0.9m.
For the Group and Company, total equity at 31 March 2005 is 1.7m lower 1 April 2004: 0.8m.
d IFRS 3 Goodwill Under IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
On the balance sheet, under IFRS, goodwill is held at the UK GAAP carrying amount at transition date less any subsequent impairments.
The effect is to increase operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 2.0m.
After the associated tax and minority interest, the increase in profit attributable to equity holders for the year is 1.5m.
The impact on the Group balance sheet is to increase total equity at 31 March 2005 by 1.7m 1 April 2004: nil : there is no effect on the Company balance sheet.
64 LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNUAL REPORT 2006 EXPLANATION OF RECONCILING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK GAAP AND IFRS CONTINUED e IFRS 2 Share based payments Under IFRS 2, charges to the income statement are based on the fair value of the instrument granted determined using an option pricing model.
Under UK GAAP, the charge was based on the difference between the market price on the date of grant and the exercise price.
The balance sheet is adjusted to reflect the additional deferred tax arising from the increased charge to the income statement.
This reduces operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 1.0m.
After the associated tax there is a reduction in profit attributable to equity holders for the year of 0.7m.
Recognition of deferred tax on the additional charge to the income statement results in an increase in total equity at 31 March 2005 of 0.5m 1 April 2004: 0.2m for the Group and Company.
f Investment income Under UK GAAP income from fixed asset investments was reported within Share of operating profit of joint venture and income from other fixed asset investments.
Under IFRS, it is reported separately.
This results in a reclassification to the Investment income heading for the year ended 31 March 2005 of 0.1m but has no impact on profit.
g IAS 31 Joint Ventures There are three presentational changes in respect of joint ventures: 1.
The share of joint venture revenue is not reported within Group revenue although details of joint venture turnover are reported within the notes to the accounts.
Under UK GAAP the Groups share of joint venture income is reported pre-tax with the Groups share of joint ventures tax reported within the Group tax charge.
Under IFRS, the Groups share of joint ventures income is reported net of tax within profit before taxation.
As dividends receivable from joint ventures are recognised when declared rather than in the period to which they relate under UK GAAP, there is a reduction to trade and other receivables in respect of dividends declared and for the Group a corresponding increase in investment in joint venture and for the Company a reduction in retained earnings.
The impact on the income statement is to reduce profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 0.5m but with a corresponding reduction to the taxation charge such that there is no overall impact on net profit.
In the Group balance sheet there is an increase in investment in joint venture, in the Company balance sheet a reduction in retained earnings and a corresponding reduction for Group and Company in trade and other receivables at 31 March 2005 of 0.6m 1 April 2004: 0.9m.
h IAS 10 Dividends Under IAS 10, dividends are recognised in the financial statements when declared rather than in the period to which they relate.
The impact on the Group and Company balance sheet is to increase total equity by the amount of dividends declared after 31 March 2005 of 12.6m 1 April 2004: 10.0m.
i IAS 38 Intangible assets Under UK GAAP software development costs were capitalised within plant and equipment but under IFRS are required to be disclosed as intangible assets.
There is no impact on the income statement, but in the balance sheet these assets are reclassified from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
The amount transferred at 31 March 2005 for the Group is 35.5m 1 April 2004: 34.7m and for the Company is 34.8m 1 April 2004: 34.7m.
j Provisions Under UK GAAP, provisions are shown as a single amount but under IFRS are analysed between those amounts due in less than one year and those due in more than one year.
There is no impact on the income statement.
In the balance sheet there is a reclassification to report separately the amount due within one year which at 31 March 2005 for the Group is 11.9m 1 April 2004: 6.6m and for the Company is 6.7m 1 April 2004: 6.6m.
EXPLANATION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT Under UK GAAP the cash flow statement presented the movement in cash balances, analysed between nine categories of cash flow.
Under IFRS, the cash flow statement presents the movement in cash and cash equivalents, analysed between operating, investing and financing activities.
The principal consequences of these differences are that cash and cash equivalents under IFRS includes term deposits which were included in management of liquid resources under UK GAAP, and corporation tax paid, interest received and interest paid are classified within operating activities for IFRS purposes.
As software developments are reported as intangible assets under IFRS, expenditure on these is separately reported in the cash flow statement as purchase of intangible assets.
