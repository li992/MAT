Other investments At both 29 April 2006 and 30 April 2005, other investments comprised minority shareholdings which are carried at cost less provision for impairment in value.
At 29 April 2006, the Groups sole minority investment was impaired as described in note 4.
At 1 May 2005, the transition date to IAS 39, the Group held a minority listed investment in Monstermob Group PLC with a cost of 0.5 million together with options to increase this minority shareholding.
Such shares and options were revalued to fair value under IAS 39 resulting in a transition adjustment of 2.0 million as set out in note 21.
During the period, the Group exercised its option to acquire such shares and subsequently sold its entire shareholding generating a gain of 2.9 million as set out in note 4.
In 2004 05, a co-operation agreement was entered into by the Group with Eldorado Group Eldorado, the leading electrical retailer in Russia and the Ukraine.
As at 29 April 2006, the Group owns no shares in Eldorado.
However, the Group holds options to acquire Eldorado in tranches up to 100 per cent by 2011.
Such options, together with certain other options which the Group holds to acquire equity stakes in other businesses are recorded at nil owing to the equity instruments not having a quoted market price in an active market and also in the case of Eldorado, there being neither sufficient reliable financial information, nor any external market values for similar businesses, upon which a fair value can be reliably measured.
