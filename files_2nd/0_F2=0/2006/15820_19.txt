Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of the Companys ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of the Companys ordinary shares in issue during the period excludes 3,759,701 shares 2005: 2,888,908 shares, being the weighted average number of own shares held during the period.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of options and awards outstanding under the Groups employee share schemes and the dilutive effect of the potential conversion of the Companys convertible cumulative preference shares into the Companys ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of the Companys ordinary shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of options and awards over 1,229,593 shares 2005: 2,549,390 shares that were anti-dilutive for the periods presented but could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is based on the profit for the period from continuing operations before restructuring initiatives and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
The Directors consider that this provides a useful additional indicator of the trading performance of the Groups continuing operations.

The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are determined from value in use calculations in which the principal assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
Management uses discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market in which the cash-generating units operate.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following seven years based on managements assessment of industry growth rates.

Risk management policies The Groups policy in relation to financial risk management is set out in detail in the Financial Review.
The Groups central treasury function is responsible for the procurement of the Groups capital resources and for the maintenance of an efficient capital structure, together with the management of the Groups liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
All treasury operations are conducted within strict policies and guidelines that are approved by the Board.
Compliance with those policies and guidelines is monitored by the regular reporting of treasury activities to the Board.
A key element of the Groups treasury philosophy is that funding, interest rate and currency decisions and the location of cash and debt balances are determined independently of each other.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by raising funds in the most favourable markets, and the desired currency profile of net debt is achieved by entering into currency derivative contracts typically forward currency contracts and currency swaps.
The desired interest rate profile of net debt is achieved by entering into interest rate derivative contracts after taking into account any foreign currency derivatives that have been entered into to manage the currency profile of net debt.
From time to time, the Group also enters into currency derivative contracts to manage currency transaction exposures.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The Group ensures that its portfolio of derivative financial instruments is managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution.
The carrying amount of derivative financial instruments held by the Group was as follows: As at 30 December 2006 As at 31 December 2005 Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net million million million million million million Translational hedges Currency forwards 2.5 0.2 2.3 0.1 8.1 8.0 Interest rate swaps 1.5 0.3 1.2 22.1 22.1 4.0 0.5 3.5 22.2 8.1 14.1 Transactional hedges Currency forwards and swaps 1.3 0.1 1.2 2.8 0.9 1.9 5.3 0.6 4.7 25.0 9.0 16.0 Classified as: Current 2.8 0.1 2.7 5.2 0.9 4.3 Non-current 2.5 0.5 2.0 19.8 8.1 11.7 5.3 0.6 4.7 25.0 9.0 16.0 B.
Currency derivatives As at 30 December 2006, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that are used to manage the currency profile of the Groups net assets was 384.5 million 31 December 2005: 411.2 million.
The Group has designated these contracts as net investment hedges.
During 2006, a net fair value gain of 43.5 million 2005: net loss of 35.6 million in relation to these contracts was recognised directly in equity.
The Group has also designated as net investment hedges the US dollar denominated convertible cumulative preference shares and US dollar denominated borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility.
During 2006, a net currency translation gain of 26.1 million 2005: net loss of 37.0 million arising on these instruments was recognised directly in equity.
During 2006, a net loss of 0.6 million 2005: net gain of 0.9 million was recognised within other finance income in respect of currency translation hedges that did not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS39.
Also during 2006, a net fair value loss of 0.7 million 2005: net gain of 0.4 million was recognised within profit from operations in respect of currency derivatives that were held to provide an economic hedge of transactional currency exposures but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
C. Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings under the Groups Euro Medium Term Note Programme from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
As at 30 December 2006, the nominal value of the contracts outstanding was 400 million 31 December 2005: 400 million.
The Group has designated these contracts as fair value hedges in relation to the borrowings.
As at 30 December 2006, the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings was reduced by 6.4 million 31 December 2005: increased by 14.3 million to reflect the extent to which the swaps provided an effective hedge against fair value interest rate risk.
Interest rate swaps are also used to restrict the amount of floating rate US dollar debt.
As at 30 December 2006, the nominal value of these contracts held was US$275 million 31 December 2005: US$420 million, including contracts with a nominal value of US$65 million 31 December 2005: US$210 million that commence on the maturity of equivalent contracts that are currently in force.
During 2006, a net loss of 0.1 million 2005: net gain of 3.3 million was recognised within other finance income that represented changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS39.

Cash and cash equivalents and collateralised cash largely attract floating interest rates.
Accordingly, their carrying amounts are considered to approximate to fair value.
Borrowings classified as current liabilities mainly comprise overdrafts and loans that attract floating interest rates.
Accordingly, their carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value.
Borrowings classified as non-current liabilities principally comprise borrowings under the Groups multi-currency revolving credit facility that attract floating interest rates, whose carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value, and the listed bonds issued under the Groups Euro Medium Term Note Programme, whose fair values represent their quoted market prices.
Finance lease obligations attract fixed interest rates that are implicit in the lease rentals and their fair value has been assessed by reference to prevailing market interest rates.
Interest rate derivatives are valued by discounting the applicable cash flows at prevailing market interest rates.
Foreign currency derivatives are valued on a mark to market basis by reference to prevailing currency exchange rates.
The convertible cumulative preference shares are not traded in an organised market and their fair value has been assessed using a valuation model that takes into account prevailing market interest rates and the existence of the holders conversion option.

Background The Group operates pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of its employees.
The plans are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country and include defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.
The Group provides defined contribution pension benefits in most of the countries in which it operates: in particular, the majority of the Groups employees in the US are entitled to such benefits.
The expense recognised in the income statement in respect of these plans represents the contributions payable by the Group for the period at rates that are specified in the rules of the plans.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had not paid over to the plans contributions due amounting to 7.1 million 31 December 2005: 7.4 million.
All amounts due for the period were paid over subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in several countries: in particular, in the UK and the US.
Generally, the pension benefits provided under these plans are based upon pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds that are under the control of trustees.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans operated by the Group are closed to new entrants.
In addition to the funded defined benefit pension plans, the Group has unfunded defined benefit obligations to certain employees.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, principally health and life insurance cover, to certain of its employees in North America.
These plans, which are unfunded, are defined benefit plans.

The return and risk expectations for each asset class incorporate assumptions about historical return relationships, current financial market conditions and the degree of global capital market integration.
The assumptions used have been derived from rigorous historical performance analysis combined with forward looking views of the financial markets as revealed through a the yield on long-term bonds and b the price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices.
The actuaries review analyses of historical risk and the correlation of the return on asset classes and apply subjective judgement based on their knowledge of the Groups plans.
The result of this analysis is incorporated into a risk matrix from which expected long-term risk premiums for each asset class are developed.
The nominal return expectations are determined by combining the asset class risk premiums with expected inflation and real risk-free rate assumptions.
As a final consideration, the nominal return assumptions are blended with current market conditions to develop long-term equilibrium expectations.

Background The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Groups senior executives and other eligible employees.
Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 35 to 41.
Share options Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Companys executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for the purposes of new grants in May 2005.
Options will however continue to be granted from time to time under the Companys savings-related share option scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the UK.
In 2006, the compensation expense recognised in respect of share options was 2.7 million 2005: 3.9 million.
Changes in the total number of share options outstanding during the period were as follows: Year ended 30 December 2006 Year ended 31 December 2005 Weighted Weighted average average Options exercise price Options exercise price number pence number pence Outstanding at the beginning of the period 28,429,132 234.03 30,333,766 236.49 Granted during the period 233,939 269.40 419,297 218.40 Forfeited during the period 1,026,815 227.95 1,197,190 214.80 Exercised during the period 7,140,701 210.02 175,884 239.96 Expired during the period 950,857 328.80 Outstanding at the end of the period 20,495,555 243.10 28,429,132 234.03 Exercisable at the end of the period 13,743,098 243.91 5,079,142 250.35 On the dates on which options were exercised during 2006, the weighted average market price of the Companys ordinary shares was 333.60p per share 2005: 276.04p per share.
The compensation expense recognised in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted during the period were as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 December 31 December 2006 2005 Weighted average fair value 106.61p 87.24p Weighted average assumptions: Share price 336.75p 273.00p Exercise price 269.40p 218.40p Expected volatility 28.94% 30.46% Expected life 4.55 years 5.25 years Risk-free interest rate 4.50% 3.84% Expected dividends 13.00p 12.60p Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the shorter of the expected life of the options and the period since the beginning of the Groups financial year ended 30 April 2002 when, following a period of significant demerger activity, the Group was refocused on its remaining core businesses.
Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding at the end of the period was as follows: As at 30 December 2006 As at 31 December 2005 Weighted Weighted average average remaining remaining Outstanding contractual life Outstanding contractual life number years number years Range of exercise prices 150p to 200p 3,563,072 4.98 6,165,914 5.78 201p to 250p 9,641,668 6.59 15,073,768 7.06 251p to 300p 6,272,587 6.41 6,171,222 7.49 301p and higher 1,018,228 5.11 1,018,228 6.10 20,495,555 28,429,132 Annual Report 2006 87 Financial statements Group IFRS Consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Notes to the financial statements continued 34.
Share-based incentives continued C. Other awards The Groups principal ongoing share-based compensation arrangements are the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan ABIP and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Both are restricted to the Groups senior executives.
ABIP provides an award of bonus shares and deferred shares based on the profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.
Bonus shares are restricted and vest after a period of three years.
Dividends are paid on the bonus shares.
Deferred shares vest after a period of three years conditional on the participants continued employment with the Group.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares until they have vested.
During 2006, awards were granted over 1,643,031 ordinary shares 2005: 1,415,047 ordinary shares under the ABIP.
PSP, which was introduced during 2006, provides awards of shares which vest after a period of three years conditional on the Groups total shareholder return relative to its cost of equity over the vesting period and the participants continued employment with the Group.
During 2006, awards were granted over 7,866,573 ordinary shares under the PSP.
From time to time, matching awards are also made under the Share Matching Scheme SMS which is a legacy scheme that is closed to new entrants.
During 2006, there were no awards under the SMS, but during 2005 matching awards were made over 11,320 ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards made under the ABIP and the SMS is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made under these schemes during the period was 266.60p 2005: 257.08p.
The fair value of awards made under the PSP is measured using a Monte-Carlo valuation model.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of awards granted under the PSP were as follows: Year ended 30 December 2006 Weighted average fair value 87.19p Weighted average assumptions: Expected volatility 23.01% Expected life 2.78 years Risk-free interest rate 4.75% Dividend yield 4.73% Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the awards.
In 2006, the compensation expense recognised in respect of other awards was 5.2 million 2005: 4.1 million.
In 2005, the compensation expense included 0.6 million in respect of the Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan which was a plan introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol was entitled to elect to receive a cash payment in lieu of shares and for this reason the award to him under this plan was classified as a cash-settled transaction.
In the event, Mr Nicol elected to receive cash and the Companys obligation under the plan was settled on 28 February 2005.

No income taxes have been provided on the Companys share of these undistributed earnings due to managements ability and intent to reinvest such amounts indefinitely.
A determination of the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liability has not been made because it is not practical to do so.
A portion of these earnings can be distributed without incurring additional taxes.
