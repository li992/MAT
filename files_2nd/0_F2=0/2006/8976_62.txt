The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 3.
The Group does not speculate in financial instruments.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and liabilities as defined in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
a dERIvATIvES, FINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS ANd RISK MANAGEMENT In general, the Group does not use derivative instruments and financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices, with the exception of MKM, where limited commodity futures are used to manage its exposure to copper prices.
b FoREIGN CuRRENCy RISK The Group has translational currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating company in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The functional currency of Kazakhmys LLC is the Kazakhstan tenge, with MKM having a euro functional currency and the Company having a US dollar functional currency.
The currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar for revenues, bank deposits, trade receivables, certain trade payables and loans of Kazakhmys LLC, and the US dollar in respect of certain revenues, trade receivables and trade payables of MKM.
The Group does not generally enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The analysis in the table below of the net monetary assets and liabilities indicates the Groups exposure to currencies other than the functional currency of a company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2006 and 2005, these exposures were as follows: $ million uS dollar uK sterling Euro KzT 2006 Company n a 5.2 304.5 MKM 20.3 39.6 n a Kazakhmys LLC 1,373.7 207.2 n a 1,394.0 34.4 207.2 304.5 $ million US dollar UK sterling Euro KZT 2005 Company n a 5.4 164.5 MKM 16.0 22.5 n a Kazakhmys LLC 262.2 195.1 n a 278.2 27.9 195.1 164.5 c CoMModITy PRICE RISK The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in the price of copper, which is quoted in US dollars on the international markets.
The Group pepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of copper prices in the future.
The Group is also exposed, to a lesser degree, to the prices of other metals, including zinc, gold and silver, which are also products produced by the Group.
The Group with the exception of MKM does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of copper and other mineral commodities.
MKM uses natural hedging arising on back-to-back purchase and supply contracts to manage its economic exposure to changes in the price of copper.
In those limited cases where a natural hedge is not possible, MKM uses commodity futures to manage its exposure to changes in the price of copper.
d CREdIT RISK The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
It is the Groups policy that credit evaluations are performed on all customers who wish to trade on credit terms whereby they require credit over a certain amount.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure.
Credit risk relating to the Groups other financial assets, comprising principally current investments and cash and cash equivalents, arises from the potential default of counterparties.
Management regularly monitors the financial strength of counterparties through its knowledge of local market conditions.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2006, 6 2005: 3 customers accounted for 65% 2005: 97% of the trade and other receivables balance of the Kazakh Mining business.
By 14 March 2007, 100% 29 March 2006: 98% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.

These securities amounted to $2.7 million as at 31 December 2006 2005: $3.1 million.
The Group is therefore exposed to fluctuations in the market price of these securities.
f LIquIdITy RISK The Group maintains a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of bank term deposits of varying maturities and short-term credit facilities.
Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its bank term deposits.
In the event that bank term deposits in Kazakhstan need to be liquidated at short notice in advance of their contracted maturity date, the terms of these investments permit their immediate conversion to cash and, in some instances, the forfeiture of interest accrued to the date of liquidation.
g INTEREST RATE RISK The Group has financial assets and liabilities, which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily loans and borrowings by changing either their fair value fixed rate debt or their future cash flows variable rate debt.
The Group does not have a formal policy of determining how much of the Groups exposure should be at fixed or at variable rates and the Group does not use hedging instruments to manage the exposure.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate borrowing would be more favourable to the Group over the expected period until maturity.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the tables below are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

In other cases fair value has been determined as of the balance sheet date by discounting the estimated future cash flows using market interest rates for similar instruments.
As a result of this exercise the Directors have determined that the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, comprising cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, restricted cash, current and non-current investments, trade payables and borrowings, approximates to the carrying amounts.
