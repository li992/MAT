ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The following sets out the key assumptions concerning the future and key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may cause material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within the next financial year.
Insurance proceeds The accounts include an amount of 34.6m recognised as compensation following the Buncefield explosion.
This is a provisional amount based on what is reliably measurable at 30 April 2006 for the recoverability of impaired assets and costs incurred to date.
At 30 April 2006 20.0m of insurance proceeds had been received.
The net balance of 14.6m is shown in other receivables.
Land and buildings at our head office next to Buncefield have been impaired in full to reflect the reduction in market value following the incident.
An insurance receipt equivalent to this impairment has been recognised for re-instating the building to the extent that it is reliably measurable under the Groups policy and is recognised as other operating income.
As part of this, land valued at 6.5m has been written down to nil with no expected receipts recorded.
Other assets destroyed in the incident have been impaired in full.
Insurance proceeds have been recognised to the extent they can be reliably measured and are recognised as other operating income.
Where customers business was interrupted full provision for service credits and compensation has been made.
Insurance proceeds have been recognised where such payments are virtually certain to be recovered under the insurance policy and are shown as other operating income.
Discussions are still taking place with the insurers concerning the actual compensation due.
Pensions Details of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the recognised liability for the defined benefit plan are given in note 18.
Changes to the discount rate, mortality rates and actual return on plan assets may necessitate material adjustments to this liability in the future.
Provisions Note 19 to the accounts contains information about the assumptions made concerning the Groups provisions.

Notes to the reconciliation of equity The impact of deferred tax of the adjustments described below is set out in note f. a The provisions of IFRS 3 Business combinations have been applied prospectively from 1 May 2004.
The Group has chosen not to restate business combinations which took place before the date of transition.
The excess of purchase cost over tangible net assets on business combinations subsequent to 1 May 2004, has been reviewed and allocated to intellectual property and other intangibles as appropriate and any residual balance capitalised as goodwill and subjected to annual impairment reviews.
Under UK GAAP, the Group's policy has been to amortise goodwill on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life of up to 20 years.
Under IFRS, instead of an annual charge to the profit and loss account, an impairment review will be carried out at each balance sheet date.
This is required irrespective of there being an indicator of impairment in existence.
If impairment is identified, the resulting debit will be charged to the income statement.
New intangibles created under IFRS 3 relating to customer relationships are amortised over a useful economic life of 10 years.
During the year ended 30 April 2005 the Group acquired CIM, MVM and Sx3.
In relation to these acquisitions the balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect a reclassification from goodwill to intangible assets of 75,681,000 at 30 April 2005.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets was 688,000 in the year ended 30 April 2005.
NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC 76 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued for the year ended 30 April 2006 29.
EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued Notes to the reconciliation of equity continued In addition to the adjustment above, the carrying value of goodwill has also been adjusted for the reversal of the UK GAAP goodwill amortisation charge of 14,535,000 and the reversal of a fair value adjustment made subsequent to the acquisition of Northgate CSG, of 1,450,000.
Under IFRS the timeframe for assessing fair value adjustments made on acquisitions is restricted to 12 months from the date of acquisition, as opposed to the end of the next Group accounting period, which is the case under UK GAAP.
These changes result in an increase in operating profit for the year ended 30 April 2005 of 12,397,000.
Net assets are increased by 11,663,000 at 30 April 2005, net of deferred taxation.
b As permitted by UK GAAP, the Group has historically expensed all development expenditure as incurred, whereas IFRS requires such expenditure, providing certain criteria are met, to be capitalised and amortised over its useful life commencing with the date at which the asset is available for use.
The useful life of each capitalised asset is determined by reference to the period of benefit.
It is anticipated that this will typically be three years.
At the date of transition to IFRSs, development expenditure of 3,032,000 qualified for recognition as an intangible asset.
This, together with its related amortisation of 1,299,000, was capitalised increasing net assets by 1,733,000 1,213,000 net of deferred taxation.
In the year-ended 30 April 2005, additional development expenditure of 2,397,000 was capitalised.
The amortisation charge for the year was 1,387,000, with the increase in operating profit being 1,010,000.
The cumulative effect on net assets at 30 April 2005 of development cost capitalisation less amortisation was 2,743,000 1,921,000 net of deferred taxation.
c Under UK GAAP, the cost of share options is based on the difference between exercise price and the market value of the share option at the date of grant.
Since grants made under Northgates share option schemes have generally been made at an exercise price equal to market value, they have not historically resulted in a charge to the income statement on issue.
Subsequent movements between the option issue price and the market value are charged to the profit and loss as incurred over the option vesting period.
Under IFRS 2 Share based payments, Northgate is required to measure the fair value of all share options granted including SAYE options since 7 November 2002, that have not fully vested at 1 January 2005, using an appropriate option pricing model: this cost is spread over the three year vesting period.
The net charge to operating profit relating to IFRS 2 amounts to 1,656,000 for the year to 30 April 2005.
The comparative charge to the profit and loss account under UK GAAP was 412,000. d Northgate operates two defined benefit pension schemes together with various defined contribution pension schemes.
Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for these schemes in accordance with SSAP 24 which requires that the expected cost be charged to the profit and loss account so as to accrue the cost over the service lives of employees on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Under IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits, the net surplus or deficit for each defined benefit scheme is calculated based upon the present value of the defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The Group has recognised all cumulative gains and losses at the transition date for all employee benefit schemes falling within the scope of IAS 19 revised.
This means that the net deficit on the Groups employee defined benefit pension schemes will be included in net assets at 1 May 2004.
This change results in a reduction in net assets at 1 May 2004 of 27,790,000 and 30 April 2005 of 29,823,000, net of deferred taxation.
The charge to the income statement under IAS 19 revised comprises the current service cost, interest cost on scheme liabilities, expected return on scheme assets and any impact of any settlements or curtailments.
Actuarial gains and losses occurring after the transition date will be recognised as they occur in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
e There are certain other adjustments to UK GAAP resulting from the adoption of IFRS which include: A liability has been recorded for all accrued entitlements for holiday pay at each balance sheet date.
This change results in a reduction in net assets at both 1 May 2004 and 30 April 2005 of 751,000, net of deferred taxation.
Certain assets and liabilities disclosed under UK GAAP have been reclassified under IFRS between current and non-current provisions.
Major spares stock has been reclassified from fixed assets to inventories.
