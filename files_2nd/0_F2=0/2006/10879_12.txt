Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS With effect from 1 April 2005, National Grid Gas plc is required to report its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The tables below present the impact of conversion from UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP to IFRS on the primary statements.
The transition date chosen for the adoption of IFRS is 1 April 2004 and one year of IFRS comparatives is included in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
As permitted by International Financial Reporting Standard 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS IFRS 1, the comparative balance sheet at 31 March 2005 and income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 have not been restated to reflect the adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 on 1 April 2005.
Summary disclosures on the impact of the adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 as at 1 April 2005 are included in note 2. a Impact of adoption of IFRS on net assets at 1 April 2004 date of adoption of IFRS The following is a summary of the IFRS measurement adjustments as they affected net assets at 1 April 2004 the date of adoption of IFRS, which arise as a consequence of applying IFRS measurement principles as compared with UK GAAP.

Adoption of IFRS continued c IFRS measurement adjustments The following relate to the measurement adjustments included in the income statement and balance sheet.
i Replacement expenditure repex Repex represents the cost of planned replacement of gas mains and services and is undertaken to maintain the safety of the networks.
Under UK GAAP, the gas distribution pipeline network is treated as a single infrastructure asset for accounting purposes and repex is recorded as an expense as it represents a repair to that single infrastructure asset and repex does not have the effect of enhancing the economic benefits of the pipeline network as a whole.
Under IFRS, the individual assets and components within the gas distribution pipeline network are recorded separately, and hence repex is treated as the replacement or restoration of those individual assets or components.
The adjustment to net assets reflects the aggregate of the cumulative capitalisation of repex incurred, net of cumulative depreciation, the derecognition of previously replaced gas mains and services, the effect on cumulative depreciation of depreciating gas mains and services at an individual asset or component level, rather than at a distribution pipeline network level, and the effect of treating contributions received towards the cost of altering gas mains and services as deferred income.
ii Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences, being the differences between the book recorded value and the tax base of assets and liabilities.
The adoption of IFRS resulted in a total increase in the net deferred tax liability at 1 April 2004 of 1,236m, which includes the tax effect of the other IFRS adjustments which are shown net of tax in the reconciliations above.
iii Other measurement adjustments Other differences on transition from UK GAAP to IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2005 comprises items which are not individually material.
d IFRS presentation adjustments The following notes relate to the presentation adjustments included in the income statement and balance sheet.
i Cash and cash equivalents Under UK GAAP, cash excludes short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant change in value.
Under IFRS, such investments are included within cash and cash equivalents.
ii Software Under UK GAAP, software is capitalised together with the related hardware within property, plant and equipment.
Under IFRS, software is classified within intangible assets.
iii Short term provisions Under UK GAAP, provisions are presented on the balance sheet separately from creditors and include both current and noncurrent provisions.
Under IFRS, the current portion of provisions is included within current liabilities.
e Impact of adoption of IFRS on cash flow statement The principal changes to the Group cash flow statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 on adoption of IFRS are summarised below.
Income taxes of 202m paid during the year ended 31 March 2005 are classified as part of operating cash flows under IFRS, but were classified as a separate category of the cash flow under UK GAAP.
Payments in respect of replacement expenditure of 506m, which were previously written off to the income statement under UK GAAP, are now capitalised under IFRS.
Therefore, this expenditure is classified as investing activities in the IFRS cash flow statement, but was previously classified as operating cash flow under UK GAAP.
In accordance with IAS 7 Cash flow statements, cash equivalents include certain short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant change in value.
These were previously shown within cash flows from the management of liquid resources, as they did not fall within the definition of cash according to UK GAAP.

Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Notes 2 and 3 Notes to the Accounts 47 National Grid Gas 2.
Adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 and presentation of net debt at 1 April 2005 a Adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 On 1 April 2005 the Group adopted IAS 39 and IAS 32.
IAS 39 requires certain financial instruments to be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value rather than historical cost.
Note 18 contains the disclosures required by IAS 39, IAS 32 and IFRS 7.
The principal effect of the adoption of these standards at 1 April 2005 is to record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet at their fair value, while deferred gains and losses relating to items qualifying for hedge accounting are derecognised and instead recorded in equity for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or by adjusting the carrying value of the hedged financial instrument for fair value hedges.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 and the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 have not been restated to reflect the adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 on 1 April 2005. b Effect of IAS 39 on net debt and net assets IAS 39 IAS 39 IFRS transition  ifications IAS 39 At 31 March at 1 April at 1 April at 1 April 2005 2005 2005 2005 i ii iii m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 4 4 Financial investments 12 12 Borrowings 5,276 173 165 5,614 5,260 173 165 5,598 Derivative financial assets 121 18 139 Derivative financial liabilities 78 8 70 Net debt 5,260 130 139 5,529 Accrued interest 139 139 Deferred gains and losses 23 23 Other assets and liabilities 10,326 48 10,374 Net assets 4,904 59 4,845 i On the adoption of IAS 39, derivative financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet, with corresponding adjustments to retained earnings or to other reserves within equity in respect of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges or to the carrying value of debt in respect of derivatives qualifying as fair value hedges.
The impact on other assets and liabilities principally relates to the deferred tax effect of these adjustments.
ii Up to 31 March 2005, deferred gains and losses relating to hedged financial instruments were carried forward in the balance sheet and reflected in the income statement in line with those hedged financial instruments.
Under IAS 39, deferred gains and losses relating to qualifying hedge relationships are recorded in equity for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or by adjusting the carrying value of the hedged financial instrument for fair value hedges or in the income statement if hedge accounting is not achieved.
iii Up to 31 March 2005, accrued interest were presented separately within creditors from the financial instruments to which it relates.
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39 the carrying value of borrowings and derivative financial assets and liabilities includes the related accrued interest balance.
Segmental analysis Segmental information is presented in accordance with the management responsibilities and economic characteristics, including consideration of risks and returns, of the Groups business activities.
The following table describes the main activities for each business segment: UK gas transmission The gas transmission network in the UK and the associated UK liquefied natural gas LNG storage activity UK gas distribution Four of the eight regional networks of Great Britains gas distribution system UK gas metering Regulated gas metering activities in the UK Other activities primarily relate to corporate overheads.
In the Group UK GAAP accounts for the year ended 31 March 2005, UK gas metering and our UK liquefied natural gas LNG storage activity were reported within other activities.
Our LNG storage activity is now included within UK gas transmission following a change in the organisational and management structure within the Group and UK gas metering is reported as a separate segment, both having previously been reported within other activities under UK GAAP.
The impact of these changes on segment results has been reflected in the tables below.
The impact of this change on the UK gas transmission segment results for the year ended 31 March 2005 was to increase revenue by 21m and operating profit by 6m, increase total assets by 56m and total liabilities by 8m, increase capital expenditure by 7m and increase depreciation and amortisation by 7m.
Within Other activities, revenue was decreased by 397m and operating profit by 110m, total assets and total liabilities decreased by 995m and 111m respectively, capital expenditure decreased by 73m and depreciation and amortisation decreased by 137m.
Intra-group revenue eliminations were reduced by 17m.
There was no difference between the impact on operating profit before exceptional items and remeasurements and that for operating profit after exceptional items and remeasurements.

Segmental analysis continued Discontinued operations comprise the operations of the four gas distribution networks that the Group sold on 1 June 2005.
The results for discontinued operations are disclosed in note 11.
The Group assesses the performance of its businesses principally on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items and remeasurements.
The Groups primary reporting format is by business.
All the Groups sales and operations take place within the UK, hence there is no secondary reporting format.
Sales between businesses are priced having regard to the regulatory and legal requirements that the businesses are subject, which include requirements to avoid cross-subsidies.

d Share option and award schemes National Grid operates two principal forms of share option scheme in which the employees and Directors of the Group participate.
They are an employee Sharesave scheme and an Executive Share Option Plan the Executive Plan.
The details given below relate to the schemes operated by National Grid and the Sharesave scheme formerly operated by Lattice.
Following the Merger, most Lattice scheme options were converted into 0.375 National Grid plc options.
The remaining Lattice scheme options lapsed on 29 April 2003.
In any 10-year period, the maximum number of shares that may be issued or issuable pursuant to the exercise of options under all of National Grids share option schemes may not exceed the number of shares representing 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of National Grid from time to time.
The Sharesave scheme is savings related where, under normal circumstances, share options are exercisable on completion of a three or a five-year save-as-you-earn contract.
The exercise price of options granted represents 80% of the market price at the date the option was granted.
The Executive Plan applies to senior executives, including Executive Directors.
Options granted for the 1999 2000 financial year are subject to the achievement of performance targets related to earnings per share growth over a three-year period and have now vested.
Options granted for the 2000 01 financial year and thereafter are subject to the achievement of performance targets related to total shareholder returns over a three-year period.
The share options are generally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant if the relevant performance target is achieved.
National Grid also operates a number of share award schemes including a Performance Share Plan PSP and a Share Matching Plan.
Under the PSP, awards have been made to Executive Directors and approximately 150 senior employees who have significant influence over the Groups ability to meet its strategic objectives.
Under the PSP, awards are conditional on National Grids total shareholder return over a three-year period.
Awards are delivered in National Grid plc shares.
At 31 March 2006 the number of conditional awards of ordinary share equivalents outstanding under the PSP was 1,149,000 2005: 1,012,000 of which nil 2005: nil were exercisable.
The number of conditional awards during the year ended 31 March 2006 was 400,000 2005: 558,000 with lapses forfeits during the year of 263,000 2005: 58,000 and exercises of nil 2005: 1,000.
The Share Matching Plan applies to Executive Directors whereby a predetermined part of each Directors bonus entitlement is automatically deferred into National Grid plc shares and a matching award may be made under the Plan after a three-year period provided the Director is still employed by the Group.
At 31 March 2006 the number of conditional awards of ordinary share equivalents outstanding under the Share Matching Plan was 38,000 2005: 33,000 of which nil 2005: 2,000 were exercisable.
The number of conditional awards during the year ended 31 March 2006 was 13,000 2005: 25,000 with exercises during the year of 8,000 2005: nil.

Payroll costs and employees continued d Share option and award schemes continued Awards under share option plans The average share prices at the date of options being granted during each of the two financial years ended 31 March were as follows: 2006 2005 Where the exercise price is less than the market price at the date of grant 569.0p 496.0p The average exercise prices of the options granted during each of the two financial years ended 31 March were as follows: 2006 2005 Where the exercise price is less than the market price at the date of grant 434.0p 383.0p The average fair values of the options granted during each of the two financial years ended 31 March were estimated as follows: 2006 2005 Where the exercise price is less than the market price at the date of grant 128.2p 92.1p The fair values of the options granted were estimated using the following principal assumptions: 2006 2005 Dividend yield % 4.5 5.5-5.8 Volatility % 15.6-18.9 15.4 Risk-free investment rate % 4.2 4.5 Average life years 4.3 4.0 The fair values of awards under the Sharesave scheme have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
This is considered appropriate given the short exercise window of sharesave options.
Volatility has been derived based on the following: i implied volatility in traded options over National Grid plcs shares: ii historical volatility of National Grid plcs shares from October 2002 the date of the merger of National Grid Group plc and Lattice Group plc : and iii implied volatility of comparator companies where options in their shares are traded.
Volatility is assumed to revert from its current implied level to its long run mean, based on historical volatility under ii above.
Awards under other share scheme plans The average share prices and fair values at the date share awards were granted during each financial years ended 31 March were as follows: 2006 2005 Average share price 535.6p 431.7p Average fair value 358.0p 210.6p The fair values of the awards granted were estimated using the following principal assumptions: 2006 2005 Dividend yield % 4.4 5.3-5.7 Volatility % 19.9 15.4 Risk-free investment rate % 4.1 4.5-5.2 Fair values have been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, for awards with total shareholder return performance conditions.
Fair values of awards with performance conditions based on earnings per share have been calculated using the share price at date of grant less the present value of dividends foregone during the performance period.
For other share scheme awards, where the primary vesting condition is that employees complete a specified number of years service, the fair value has been calculated as the share price at date of grant, adjusted to recognise the extent to which participants do not receive dividends over the vesting period.
Volatility for share awards has been calculated on the same basis as used for share options, as described above.

Directors emoluments The aggregate amount of emoluments paid to Directors in respect of qualifying services for 2006 was 2,490,520 2005: 2,372,748.
The amount paid in respect of compensation for loss of office in 2006 was 284,510 2005: nil.
Directors emoluments include amounts in respect of accrued bonus which had not yet been approved at the date of these accounts.
Five Directors exercised share options during 2006 2005: three Directors.
A number of the current Directors are also directors and employees of National Grid plc or a subsidiary undertaking of that company and are paid by these companies.
As at 31 March 2006, retirement benefits were accruing to seven Directors under a defined benefit scheme 2005: six defined benefit schemes, one defined contribution scheme.
The aggregate emoluments for the highest paid Director were 572,517 for 2006 2005: 543,389 : and total accrued annual pension at 31 March 2006 for the highest paid Director was 195,000 2005: 220,731.
The amount of contributions paid in respect of defined contribution pension schemes was 17,300 2005: 20,400.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Substantially all the Groups employees are members of the defined benefit section of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme formerly named the Lattice Group Pension Scheme the scheme.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to the Group.
Accordingly, the Group accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Pension scheme The scheme provides final salary defined benefits for employees who joined prior to 31 March 2002 and defined contribution benefits for employees joining from 1 April 2002.
The scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
It is subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contribution, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The latest full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2006 is currently being carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP.
The last completed full actuarial valuation was as at 31 March 2003.
The projected unit method was used and the principal actuarial assumptions adopted were that the annual rate of inflation would be 2.5% and that future real increases in pensionable earnings would be 1.5%.
Investments held in respect of pensions before they become payable would average 5.05% real annual rate of return and investments held in respect of pensions after they become payable would average 2.7% real rate of return and that pensions would increase at a real annual rate of 0.05%.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was 10,141m and the value of the assets represented approximately 92% of the actuarial value of benefits due to members calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2003 on an ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.
The results of the actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2003 showed that based on long-term financial assumptions the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 23.7% of pensionable earnings 20.7% employers and 3% employees.
This contribution rate is currently being reviewed.
The ongoing contribution rate does not include an allowance for administration expenses.
These contributions are renewed annually.
From 1 April 2006 the rate used for the recovery of administration costs was 3% of salary.
Employers are currently, therefore, paying a total contribution rate of 23.7%.
It has been agreed that no funding of the deficit identified in the 2003 actuarial valuation will need to be provided to the scheme until the outcome of an actuarial valuation at 31 March 2007 is known.
At this point, National Grid will pay the gross amount of any deficit up to a maximum amount of 520m 364m net of tax into the scheme.
The Groups share of these payments would be 468m 328m net of tax.
Until the 31 March 2007, actuarial valuation has been completed, National Grid has arranged for banks to provide the trustees of the scheme with letters of credit.
The main conditions under which these letters of credit could be drawn relate to events which would imperil the interests of the scheme, such as National Grid Gas plc becoming insolvent or National Grid failing to make agreed payments into the fund.

ii A promotional age related scale has been used where appropriate.
iii The assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the plan.
The expected real returns on specific asset classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from the schemes actuaries.
The long-term target asset allocation for the scheme is 40% equities, 52% bonds and 8% property and other.

The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates.
The analysis also excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2006.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 March 2006 and is not representative of the year then ended as all of these varied during the course of 2005 06.
64 Notes to the Accounts Note 18 continued Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 National Grid Gas 18.
Financial instruments continued The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments, as debt and deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt: changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from movements in changes in UK interest rates.
Income Equity statement - m - m UK interest rates - 0.10% 8 Derivative financial instruments The Groups hedging policies are set out on page 23.
The Group has entered into a number of derivative financial instruments as detailed below, which are designated as follows: Fair value hedges The Group maintains interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by the Group.
Change in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the income statement within interest expense and other finance costs.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within net losses gains on derivative financial instruments.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement within interest expense and other finance costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount is amortised to the income statement under the effective interest rate method.
Cash flow hedges The Group maintains interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps that qualify for hedge accounting as designated cash flow hedges relating to future interest payments on debt.
The revaluation of these swaps is included in the cash flow hedge reserve and is recycled to the income statement as the interest charge relating to the debt is recorded.
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated and committed future purchases.
Where designated, these contracts qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges.
When the underlying purchase is recorded, the associated gains and losses deferred in equity are removed and included in the initial cost of the asset.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship The Groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39 some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is appropriate.

Financial instruments continued The maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are shown in the table below after taking into account currency and interest rate swaps: Maturity of financial assets and liabilities at 31 March 2005 Assets Liabilities mm In one year or less 16 1,887 In more than one year, but not more than two years 846 In more than two years, but not more than three years 345 In more than three years, but not more than four years 459 In more than four years, but not more than five years 498 In more than five years or no maturity date 2,644 1.257 2,660 5,292 At 31 March 2005 the weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings of 1,880m was 4.3%.
Other sterling financial liabilities at 31 March 2005 comprised onerous leases of 16m.
Substantially all the variable rate borrowings are subject to interest rates which fluctuate with LIBOR London Inter Bank Offered Rate.
In calculating the weighted average number of years for which interest rates are fixed, swaps which are cancellable at the option of the swap provider are assumed to have a life based on the earliest date at which they can be cancelled.

The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but it is expected to be incurred over the period 2007 to 2057 with some 33% of the spend projected to be spent over the next five years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The Group has made its best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2006 relating to gas site decontamination was 72m 2005: 127m, being the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above.
Emissions provision The provision for emission costs will be settled using emission allowances granted to the Group which are reported as an intangible asset.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2006, 10m of the total restructuring provision 2005: 16m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, largely to be paid within the next financial year.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2006 include 28m 2005: nil in respect of the sales of four gas distribution networks and are related to property transfer costs.
14m is expected to be paid within one year with the remainder over the following four years.
