Parent Company Financial Statements m Post retirement benefits The Company maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years.
The last valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2004, using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, showed the value of assets to be sufficient to cover 87 per cent of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
At 29 April 2006, the valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of FRS 17 showed a gross pension deficit of 141.7 million 30 April 2005 186.5 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, which although presented under IAS 19 Employment Benefits show figures and disclosures equivalent to those applicable under FRS 17.
