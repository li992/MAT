CHEMRING GR OUP PLC Notes to the Group Financial Statements - continued 23.
DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so.
The main risks addressed by the financial instruments of the Group are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year, were as follows: Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and leasing lines of credit.
The UK borrowings are denominated in sterling and US dollar and are subject to fixed rates of interest through an amortising LIBOR swap and floating rates of interest linked to Bank of Scotland base rate to provide flexibility.
The overseas borrowings are denominated in local currency and are predominantly subject to fixed rates of interest.
Foreign exchange risk: Foreign exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk: Transactional risk The Group policy is to hedge significant transactional currency exposures via the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The measurement and control of this risk is closely monitored on a Group-wide basis.
Translation riskThe Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2.
The translation risk on net assets is controlled by the transfer of currencies between Group companies and the appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
Liquidity risk: Details of the maturity profiles of the Groups funding can be found in Note 20.
