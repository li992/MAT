MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 80 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Basis of Preparation a Accounting standards applied The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
For these purposes, IFRS comprises the Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC that have been endorsed by the European Union EU.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except as follows: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures.
This standard and the related amendment will require additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
This standard will require different disclosures relating to the Groups operating segments and how these are identified when it comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
This interpretation will require the present classification of certain assets acquired through the Groups water concession within property, plant and equipment, to be reviewed when it comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2008. b Change in accounting policy The Groups previously stated policy was to account for jointly controlled entities under the equity method.
Under the Groups revised policy, jointly controlled entities are accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method, which is the benchmark treatment under IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
This change does not have any effect on the financial statements for prior periods and therefore no restatement of prior period information is required.
c Change in estimates Previously mining properties, including capitalised financing costs, were depreciated in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven, probable and possible reserves at the beginning of the year.
From 1 January 2006, such depreciation is based on comparison with proven and probable reserves only at the beginning of the year.
The effect of this change is to increase the depreciation charge in the year ended 31 December 2006 by US$1.6 million.
As a change in estimates, prior year comparatives have not been restated, but the effect would have been to increase the depreciation charge by US$2.4 million in 2005. d Restatement of comparative amounts for bonus issue Comparatives for earnings per share and dividend per share have been restated for the effect of the 4-for-1 bonus issue of ordinary shares on 19 June 2006 see Note 25.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 80 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 81 2 Principal Accounting Policies a Accounting convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the use of fair values to measure certain financial instruments, principally provisionally priced sales as explained in Note 2 d and financial derivative contracts as explained in Note 2 s. b Basis of consolidation The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Antofagasta plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively the Group.
i Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
The consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating inter-company balances and transactions.
For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets and net earnings attributable to minority shareholders are presented as Minority Interests in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement.
ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or jointly control, through the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity.
The Groups share of the net assets, the results post tax and post acquisition reserves of associates are included in the financial statements.
This requires recording the investment initially at cost to the Group and then, in subsequent periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reflect the Groups share of the associates results less any impairment of goodwill and any other changes to the associates net assets such as dividends.
iii Jointly controlled entities A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and shares joint control over the operating and financial decisions with one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using proportionate consolidation, which combines the Groups share of the results of the jointly controlled entity on a line by line basis with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
iv Other investments The accounting treatment of investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities is set out in Note 2 s relating to financial instruments.
v Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions and disposals are treated as explained in Note 2 e relating to business combinations and goodwill.
c Currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions other than those in the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are retranslated at year end exchange rates.
Gains and losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period within other finance items.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 81 MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 82 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued c Currency translation continued The presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Company is the US dollar.
On consolidation, income statement items for entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated at period end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on translation of the net assets of such entities are taken to equity and recorded in a separate currency translation reserve.
The Group elected to set the currency translation reserve to zero at 1 January 2004 as permitted by IFRS 1.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition date to IFRS are recognised as income or as expenses in the income statement in the period in which an operation is disposed of.
On consolidation, exchange gains and losses which arise on balances between Group entities are taken to reserves where that balance is, in substance, part of a parents net investment in its subsidiary, i. e. where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
All other exchange gains and losses on Group balances are dealt with in the income statement.
Fair value adjustments and any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated at the period end rate.
d Revenue recognition Turnover represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties during the year.
Turnover is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, and excludes any applicable sales tax.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed.
This is generally when title and any insurance risk has passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location or when any services have been provided.
Turnover from mining activities is recorded at the invoiced amounts with an adjustment for provisional pricing at each reporting date, as explained below.
For copper and molybdenum concentrates, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants for further processing, the invoiced amount is the market value of the metal payable by the customer, net of deductions for tolling charges.
Turnover includes revenues from the sale of by-products.
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment, with final pricing based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange LME copper price or the monthly average market molybdenum price for specified future periods.
This normally ranges from 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer.
Such a provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is required to be separated from the host contract.
The host contract is the sale of metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the provisional invoice price less tolling charges deducted, and the embedded derivative is the forward contract for which the provisional sale is subsequently adjusted.
At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal sales together with any related tolling charges are marked-to-market, with adjustments both gains and losses being recorded in turnover in the consolidated income statement and in trade debtors in the balance sheet.
Forward prices at the period end are used for copper concentrate and cathode sales, while period-end average prices are used for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment have been established.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 82 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 83 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued e Business combinations and goodwill i Acquisitions The results of businesses acquired during the year are brought into the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, joint venture entity or an associate which can be measured reliably are recorded at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition.
Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
ii Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Any goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is separately disclosed, while any goodwill on the acquisition of associates is included within investments in equity accounted entities.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised.
Where the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of the acquisition, the surplus which represents the discount on the acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
iii Disposals The results of businesses sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements for the period up to the effective date of disposal.
Gains or losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between the sales proceeds net of expenses and the net assets attributable to the interest which has been sold.
Where a disposal represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, the net results attributable to the disposed entity are shown separately in the income statement.
f Intangible assets i Concession right In 2003, the Groups wholly owned subsidiary, Aguas fide Antofagasta S. A. was awarded a 30 year concession to operate the water rights and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile previously controlled by Empresa fide Servicios Sanitarios fide Antofagasta S. A. ESSAN.
The Group has recognised on its balance sheet the tangible assets transferred to it by way of concession where the economic benefits are primarily to be consumed over the life of the concession arrangement.
An intangible asset a concession right has been recognised in respect of the right to use those assets not recognised as their lives extend substantially beyond the period of the concession.
The concession right was measured as the difference between the cost of the concession and the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition.
ii Exploration licences In 2006, the Group acquired Tethyan Copper Company Limited Tethyan, a company with copper-gold interests in Pakistan, and entered into a joint venture over Tethyans mineral interests with Barrick Gold Corporation through the disposal of a 50% interest in Tethyan.
An intangible asset has been recognised for the Groups proportionate share of the full unencumbered value attributed to the interest in the exploration licences held by Tethyan in Pakistan.
g Exploration expenditure Exploration is expensed in the year in which it is incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining project is commercially viable normally when the project has reached the pre-feasibility stage all further directly attributable pre-production expenditure is capitalised.
Capitalisation of pre-production expenditure ceases when commercial levels of production are achieved.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 83 MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 84 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued h Property, plant and equipment The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets in the year in which they are incurred.
The cost of plant, property and equipment comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended.
Once a project has been established as commercially viable, expenditure on it is capitalised.
This includes costs incurred in preparing the site for mining operations, including stripping costs.
Capitalisation will cease when the mine is capable of commercial production with the exception of development costs which give rise to a future benefit.
Interest on borrowings directly related to construction or development of projects is capitalised, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale which, in the case of mining properties, is when they are capable of commercial production.
i Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the operation if shorter, to residual value.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: i Land Freehold land is not depreciated.
Any leasehold land is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
ii Mining properties mining properties, including capitalised financing costs, are depreciated in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven and probable reserves at the beginning of the year.
iii Buildings and infrastructure straight-line basis over 10 to 25 years.
iv Rail track including trackside equipment straight-line basis over 20 to 25 years.
v Wagons and rolling stock straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years.
vi Machinery, equipment and other assets straight-line basis over 5 to 10 years.
vii Assets under construction no depreciation until asset is available for use.
viii Assets held under finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful life.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at least annually, and changes to residual values and useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
The concession right is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the concession.
j Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill Property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 84 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 85 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued j Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill continued For mining properties, estimates of future cash flows are based on estimates of the quantities of proven and probable reserves, and assumptions as to future production levels, future commodity prices, future cash costs of production and capital expenditure.
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets includes a number of restrictions on the future cash flows that can be recognised in respect of future restructurings and improvement related expenditure.
When calculating value in use, it also requires that calculations should be based on exchange rates current at the time of assessment.
For operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is conducted in the relevant functional currency.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised immediately as additional depreciation.
Where an impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of recoverable amount but so that this does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined if no impairment had previously been recognised.
A reversal is recognised as a reduction in the depreciation charge immediately.
k Investment property Investment property is property held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation and includes land held for a currently undetermined future use.
The Group has elected to adopt the cost model in IAS 40 Investment Property.
Accordingly, investment property is measured initially at cost, which includes transaction costs for the acquisition of the property and, as detailed in Note 2 i relating to property, plant and equipment, is consequently not depreciated.
l Inventory Inventory and work-in-progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The production cost of inventory includes an appropriate proportion of depreciation and production overheads.
Raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a weighted average basis.
Finished products are valued at raw material cost, plus labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses including depreciation.
m Taxation Tax expense comprises the charges or credits for the period relating to both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit may differ from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable and deductible in different years and also excludes items that are not taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates for each entity in the consolidated financial statements which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences i. e. differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary differences with certain limited exceptions as follows: i tax payable on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is provided except where the Group is able to control the remittance of profits and it is probable that there will be no remittance of past profits earned in the foreseeable future: ii deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not affect accounting profit or taxable profit and is not a business combination: nor is deferred tax provided on subsequent changes in the carrying value of such assets and liabilities, for example where they are depreciated: and Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 85 MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 86 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued m Taxation continued iii the initial recognition of any goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered through sufficient future taxable profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to equity.
n Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs An obligation to incur decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs occurs when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining property.
Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular formal review.
Such costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are provided and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These decommissioning costs are charged against profits over the life of the mine, through depreciation of the asset and unwinding or amortisation of the discount on the provision.
Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding of the discount is included as financing costs.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period.
The costs for restoration of site damage, which is created on an ongoing basis during production, are provided for at their net present values and charged against operating profits as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to site damage created during production is charged against operating profit.
o Provision for termination of water concession Under the terms of the water concession from ESSAN, certain items of working capital recognised by Aguas fide Antofagasta as described in Note 2 f above are to be transferred to the state-owned operator ESSAN at the end of the concession period for nil consideration.
Provision is made for the estimated net present value of these assets and liabilities which are expected to be in existence when the concession comes to an end.
The unwinding of the discount is charged within financing costs.
p Post-employment benefits The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees.
For such schemes, the amount charged to the income statement is the contributions paid or payable in the year.
Employment terms may also provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes to an end.
This is typically at the rate of one month for each year of service subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of service and based on final salary level.
The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, and the calculation is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method which are regularly updated.
The obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the severance indemnity obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in the income statement within operating cost.
q Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amount of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, net of bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand.
Cash and cash equivalents normally have a maturity period of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 86 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 87 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued r Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement account in equal annual amounts over the term of the lease.
Assets under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at inception of the lease at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments derived by discounting at the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest element is charged within financing costs so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
s Other financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Investments Investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held for trading or available for sale, and are normally measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For available for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Dividends on available for sale equity investments are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
ii Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables do not generally carry any interest and are normally stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
iii Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are generally not interest bearing and are normally stated at their nominal value.
iv Borrowings loans and preference shares Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
Amounts are either recorded as financing costs in the income statement or capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2 h. Finance charges are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed rate of return without the right to participate in any surplus.
They are accordingly classified within borrowings and translated into US dollars at period end rates of exchange.
Preference share dividends are included within finance costs.
v Equity instruments Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments of the Company comprise its sterling-denominated issued ordinary share capital and related share premium.
As explained in Note 2 c, the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Company is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share premium are translated into US dollars at historical rates of exchange based on dates of issue.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 87 MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 88 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal Accounting Policies continued s Other financial instruments continued vi Derivative financial instruments As explained on page 32 and in Note 21, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price movements.
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for trading purposes.
The Group has not presently applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Accordingly derivatives are initially measured at cost which may be nil including transaction costs, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement as follows: i gains and losses from commodity derivatives are recognised in other operating income or expense: ii gains and losses from currency derivatives are recognised in net finance costs as part of exchange gains or losses in the period: and iii gains and losses from interest rate derivatives are recognised in net finance costs as part of interest income or expense in the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value are reported in the income statement for the period.
The treatment of embedded derivatives arising from provisionally-priced commodity sales contracts is set out in further detail in Note 2 d relating to turnover.
3 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty Determining many of the amounts included in the financial statements involves the use of judgement and or estimation.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimates is included in the principal accounting policies in Note 2 or the other notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are set out below.
a Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment and ore reserves estimates As explained in Notes 1 c and 2 i, mining properties, including capitalised financing costs, are depreciated in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven and probable reserves at the beginning of the year.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation may change when new information becomes available.
These include assumptions as to grade estimates and cut-off grades, recovery rates, commodity prices, exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and reclamation costs and discount rates.
The actual volume of ore extracted and any changes in these assumptions could affect prospective depreciation rates and carrying values.
The majority of other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the appropriateness of useful economic lives at least annually and, again, any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
b Impairment of assets As explained in Note 2 j, the Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
In making assessments for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are allocated to an appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amount of those assets, or CGU, is measured at the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 88 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 89 3 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty continued b Impairment of assets continued Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets to CGUs, in estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash flows and in selecting appropriate discount rates to be applied within the value in use calculation.
Subsequent changes to CGU allocation or estimates and assumptions in the value in use calculation could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
c Provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs As explained in Note 2 n, provision is made, based on net present values, for decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs as soon as the obligation arises following the development or ongoing production of a mining property.
The provision is based on a closure plan prepared with the assistance of external consultants.
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for and in the case of capitalised decommissioning costs amortise these estimated costs over the life of the mine.
The ultimate cost of decommissioning and site rehabilitation cost is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other mine sites.
The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change, for example in response to changes in ore reserves or processing levels.
As a result, there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established which would affect future financial results.
d Post employment benefits As explained in Note 2 p, the expected costs of severance indemnities relating to employee service during the period are charged to the income statement.
Any actuarial gains or losses, which can arise from differences between expected and actual outcomes or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately within operating cost in the income statement.
Assumptions in respect of the expected costs are set in consultation with an independent actuary.
These include the selection of the discount rate used, service lives and expected rates of salary increases.
While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would impact the earnings of the Group.
e Deferred taxation As explained in Note 2 m, deferred tax is not provided for future tax payable on undistributed earnings where the Group is able to control the remittance of profits and it is probable that there will be no remittance of past profits earned in the foreseeable future.
Management uses its judgement in estimating the probability of such remittances.
These are based on Group forecasts and include assumptions as to future profits and cash flows which depend on several factors including commodity prices, operating costs, production levels, capital expenditures, interest costs, debt repayment and tax rates and cash requirements which may also depend on several factors including future dividend levels.
A change in the assumptions used or in the estimate as to the probability that past profits will be remitted would impact the deferred tax charge and balance sheet provision.

The Group considers its business segments to be Los Pelambres, El Tesoro, Michilla, Exploration, Railway and other transport services and the Water concession.
Corporate and other items principally relate to costs incurred by the Company and Antofagasta Minerals S. A. the Groups mining corporate centre, but which are not allocated to any individual business segment.

Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary differences with certain limited exceptions.
The Group incurs withholding taxes on the remittance of profits from Chile and the other countries in which it operates and deferred tax is provided on undistributed earnings to the extent that remittance is probable in the foreseeable future.
The rate of first category i. e. corporation tax in Chile was 17% for both 2006 and 2005.
During 2005, new tax legislation on Chilean mining companies was passed into law with effect from 1 January 2006.
This legislation sets an additional tax of up to 5% of tax-adjusted operating profit, with the option for mining companies to elect for a lower rate of 4% by entering into a tax stability regime for a period of 12 years, after which the rate of 5% will apply.
For 2006 and 2007, 50% of the new mining tax can be offset against first category tax and the remaining 50% is tax deductible i. e. an allowable expense in determining liability to first category tax.
From 2008, when the ability to offset will no longer be available, 100% of the new mining tax will be tax deductible.
Los Pelambres, El Tesoro and Michilla opted to enter into this new tax stability agreement during 2005, and hence the effect of the legislation is to increase the effective tax rate of these three operations before taking into account deductibility against corporation tax by approximately 2% in 2006 and 2007 and 4% thereafter.
In addition to first category tax and the new mining tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on the remittance of profits from Chile.
Withholding tax is levied on remittances of profits from Chile at 35% less first category tax already paid.
Accordingly, the effective tax rate of withholding tax for the purpose of paying dividends to Group shareholders is approximately 18% of the amount remitted or expected to be remitted.

The impairment provision was reviewed following the completion of a revised mine plan in the current year and a provision of US$25.0 million retained.
The recoverable amounts in the impairment review were determined by a value in use calculation prepared using managements current estimates as to production, copper prices and cash costs in an eventual revised mine plan, and based on expected mine closure in 2009.
The calculation used a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5% to reflect risks not reflected in the underlying cash flows including the possibility of future reduced production.
The Group has not pledged any items of property, plant and equipment at the end of either 2006 or 2005.

A.
The Group had a joint venture agreement, entered into during 2002, with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce CVRD of Brazil, with the objective of developing mineral exploration activities in a defined area of interest in Southern Peru.
Under the joint venture agreement, the Group transferred its mining rights in the area of interest into Cordillera fide Las Minas S. A. CMSA.
CVRD committed to invest US$6.7 million in mineral exploration in the area of interest between 2002 to 2005, and in exchange the Group granted CVRD an option to increase its interest to 50%.
The joint venture agreement also provides for equal participation by the Group and CVRD in its management and operation.
As explained in Note 2 g, the Groups policy is to expense and not capitalise exploration as incurred, and therefore the contribution of mining properties under the joint venture agreement by the Group, the contribution of funds by CVRD and subsequent exploration expenditure under the joint venture agreement has no effect on the Groups profit and loss, cash flows or balance sheet.
As explained in Note 36, on 2 March 2007 the Group agreed to sell its 50% interest in CMSA to Panoro Minerals Limited Panoro, a company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.
The Groups share of the consideration comprises US$6.0 million plus six million common shares in Panoro.
The agreement is subject to a number of conditions including financing by Panoro and regulatory approvals.
Subject to these conditions being met, closing is expected to occur by June 2007. b Tethyan Copper Company Limited As explained in Note 27 a, on 20 April 2006 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tethyan Copper Company Limited Tethyan for cash consideration including transaction costs of US$170.4 million.
On 22 September 2006 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation Barrick Gold, to establish a 50:50 joint venture in relation to Tethyans mineral interests in Pakistan.
Further details of the part-disposal of Tethyan to Barrick Gold to give effect to the joint venture are set out in Note 28 a. Tethyan is wholly engaged in mineral exploration activities and did not generate any revenue in the period before or after acquisition by the Group.
The operating loss generated by Tethyan for the period since acquisition was US$5.3 million, which relates mainly to exploration costs expensed in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
This includes US$3.3 million during the period for which Tethyan was wholly-owned by the Group and US$2.0 million under the proportionate consolidation method during the period after which the joint venture with Barrick Gold was established.
The following amounts represent the Groups 50% share of the assets and liabilities, and results of the jointly controlled entity, and are included in the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated income statement of the Group under the proportionate consolidation method: 2006 US$m Total non-current assets 115.7 Total current assets 2.6 Total current liabilities 0.9 Total non-current liabilities 0.1 Groups share of jointly controlled entitys net assets 117.3 Operating loss 2.0 Net finance profit 2.0 Groups share of jointly controlled entitys results Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 104 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAC RF62790 G 13 4 07 15:30 Page 105 18 Inventories 2006 2005 US$m US$m Raw materials and consumables 36.6 32.8 Work in progress 68.6 45.1 Finished goods 15.1 20.9 120.3 98.8 Work in progress includes US$25.3 million related to high carbonate ore inventories at El Tesoro which are expected to be processed more than twelve months after the balance sheet date.

21 Financial Risk, Derivative Financial Instruments and Embedded Derivatives a Financial risk and risk management The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price movements.
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Group did not adopt the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in 2005 or 2006.
Accordingly, derivatives have been measured at each balance sheet date at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value have been included in the income statement for the year, within operating profit from subsidiaries and joint ventures for commodity derivatives and within net finance costs for exchange and interest derivatives.
i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to a variety of currencies.
The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the majority of the Groups sales are denominated.
Operating costs are influenced by the countries in which the Groups operations are based principally in Chile as well as those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined.
In addition to the US dollar, the Chilean peso is the most important currency influencing costs and to a lesser extent sales.
Given the significance of the US dollar to the Groups operations, this is the presentational currency of the Group for internal and external reporting.
The US dollar is also the currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of this may be held in other currencies, notably Chilean pesos and sterling, to meet short term operational and capital commitments and dividend payments.
When considered appropriate, the Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The Group also uses these instruments to reduce currency exposure on future transactions and cash flows.
The currency exposure of the Groups cash and cash equivalents is given in Note 19 d, and the currency exposure of the Groups borrowings is given in Note 20 a.
Details of exchange rate derivatives entered by the Group in the year are given in Note 21 c. The effect of exchange gains and losses included in the income statement are given in Note 6.
Exchange differences on translation of the net assets of entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar the most material of which is Aguas fide Antofagasta S. A. are taken to the currency translation reserve and are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 79.

Fluctuations in interest rate may impact on the Groups net finance income or cost, and to a lesser extent on the value of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group occasionally uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage interest rate exposures on a portion of its existing borrowings.
The interest rate exposure of the Groups cash and cash equivalents is given in Note 19 d, and the interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings is given in Note 20 a.
Details of interest rate derivatives entered by the Group are given in Note 21 c. iii Commodity price risk The Group generally sells its copper and molybdenum concentrate output at prevailing market prices, subject to final pricing adjustments which may be 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, and it is therefore exposed to changes in market prices for copper and molybdenum both in respect of future sales and previous sales which remain open as to final pricing.
The Group occasionally uses futures, min-max instruments and options to manage its exposure to copper prices.
The Groups exposure to copper and molybdenum concentrate sales which remain open as to final pricing are given in Note 21 b.
Details of commodity rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 21 c. iv Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily to trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for any doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and on derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
v Cash flow risk The Groups future cash flows depend on a number of factors, including commodity prices, production and sales levels, operating costs, capital expenditure levels and financial income and costs.
Its cash flows are therefore subject to the exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks described above as well as operational factors and input costs.
Further information on production and sales levels and operating costs are given the Financial Review on pages 22 to 25. vi Liquidity risk The Group typically holds surplus cash balances in either demand deposits or short-term deposits, while the majority of borrowings comprise corporate loans at El Tesoro and Los Pelambres which are repayable in semi-annual instalments over three and four years respectively.
At the end of both 2006 and 2005, the Group was in a net cash position, as disclosed in Note 30 c. Details of cash and cash equivalents are given in Note 19 d, while details of borrowings including the maturity profile are given in Note 20 a.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are also given in Note 20 a. b Embedded derivatives provisionally priced sales Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly average molybdenum price for specified future periods.

The Group determines mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end month average prices for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market for that commodity.

The mark-to-market adjustments at the end of each year and the effect on operating profit and net finance costs in the income statement of derivative financial instruments for each year are as follows: Balance sheet net mark to market effect on debtors creditors 2006 2005 US$m US$m Current assets derivative financial instruments 7.3 Current liabilities derivative financial instruments 40.3 7.3 40.3 Income statement total effect Balance sheet including mark to net mark to market market and realised effect on amounts on operating debtors creditors profit finance cost 2006 2005 2006 2005 US$m US$m US$m US$m Commodity 7.3 40.0 84.5 68.6 Interest 0.3 0.3 0.3 Exchange 0.3 7.3 40.3 84.8 69.2 i Commodity derivatives The Group periodically uses commodity derivatives to reduce its exposure to the market price of copper.
During 2006, the amount charged to operating profit on commodity derivatives was US$84.5 million, comprising US$44.8 million at El Tesoro and US$39.7 million at Michilla 2005 US$68.6 million, comprising US$24.8 million at El Tesoro and US$43.8 million at Michilla.
This comprised losses on derivatives which matured in 2006 of US$136.3 million 2005 US$24.1 million offset by mark-to-market gains outstanding at 31 December 2006 of US$7.3 million 2005 US$44.5 million and reversal of opening mark-to-market losses of US$44.5 million 2005 nil.
Net of margin calls of US$4.5 million, this resulted in a net balance sheet position at 31 December 2005 of US$40.0 million.
There were no margin calls at 31 December 2006.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had min max instruments at Michilla for 12,000 tonnes of copper production 2005 42,000 tonnes, with a weighted average floor of US 281.2 cents per pound and a weighted average cap of US 337.9 cents per pound 2005 weighted average floor US 115.7 cents per pound: weighted average cap US 146.7 cents per pound.
These instruments had a weighted average duration of 6.5 months and a maximum duration of one year 2005 weighted average 5 months and a maximum duration of one year.

These have a weighted average price of US 286.6 cents, a weighted average duration of 6.5 months and a maximum duration of one year.
ii Interest derivatives The Group did not have any interest derivatives outstanding at 31 December 2006.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had interest rate collars with a notional principal amount of US$108.7 million, with a weighted average floor of 5.02% and a weighted average cap of 6.00%.
These instruments had a weighted average duration of seven months.
The mark to market loss at 31 December 2005 was US$0.3 million, and the effect on the income statement is included within other finance items.
iii Exchange derivatives The Group did not enter into any exchange derivative instruments during 2006 and accordingly the effect on the income statement was nil.
During 2005, the Group entered into exchange derivative instruments to buy or sell Chilean pesos using US dollars with a net notional value of US$33.0 million.
The average duration of these derivatives was one month and the net loss was US$0.3 million.
There were no outstanding instruments at 31 December 2005 and the effect on the income statement is included within other finance items.
22 Post-Employment Benefit Obligations a Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees.
The amount charged to the income statement in both 2005 and 2006 was less than US$0.1 million, representing the amount paid in the year.
There were no outstanding amounts which remained payable at the end of either year.
b Severance provisions Employment terms at some of the Groups operations provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes to an end.
The most recent valuation was carried out in 2006 by Ral Benavente, a qualified actuary in Santiago who is not connected with the Group.

The provision is based on the net present value of the estimated value of these assets and liabilities expected to be in existence at the end of the concession.
The release of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of future costs is charged to the profit and loss account in each accounting period and is disclosed as a financing cost.
24 Deferred Tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during 2005 and 2006.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset : 2006 2005 US$m US$m Deferred tax liabilities 323.2 225.5 Deferred tax assets 3.1 6.6 Net deferred tax balances 320.1 218.9 At 31 December 2006, the Group had unused tax losses of US$21.7 million 2005 US$45.9 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of US$4.3 million 2005 US$30.6 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining US$17.4 million 2005 US$15.3 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2006, other deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets were recognised in the balance sheet amounted to US$13.9 million 2005 US$54.1 million.
At 31 December 2006, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was US$2,184.5 million 2005 US$1,368.3 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.

ii Exploration costs capitalised by Tethyan have been written off on acquisition in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
iii Total consideration includes directly attributable costs of US$6.1 million.
iv On 14 February 2006, the Group separately entered into an agreement with BHP Billiton whereby BHP Billitons rights to claw-back a material interest in certain of Tethyans mineral interests Claw-Back Right would be extinguished for a consideration of US$60 million.
Trade and other payables were adjusted on acquisition to reflect this amount which results from the fair valuing of the encumbrance over the acquired exploration licences relating to the Claw-Back Right.
Following the disposal of 50% of Tethyan to Barrick Gold Corporation Barrick Gold see Notes 27 a v and 28 a below, the Group contributed US$30 million to Tethyan for its share of the cost of extinguishing the Claw-Back Right on 23 November 2006.
This amount has been included in the net cash outflow on acquisition.
v On 22 September 2006 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation Barrick Gold, to establish a 50:50 joint venture in relation to Tethyans mineral interests in Pakistan.
Further details of the part-disposal of Tethyan to Barrick Corporation to give effect to the joint venture are set out in Note 28 a below.

If the acquisition of Tethyan had been completed on the first day of the financial year, its operating loss for the year would have been nil.
Accordingly if the acquisition had taken place on the first day of the financial year it would not have had any material effect on Group turnover or Group operating profit for the year.
b Equatorial Mining Limited On 24 August 2006 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Equatorial Mining Limited Equatorial for a cash consideration including transaction costs of US$406.1 million, following a recommended cash offer first made on 15 August 2006.

Errigal is a former minority shareholder in one of Equatorials subsidiaries whose interest was acquired in 1993, and the claim is for amounts payable under the 1993 acquisition agreement.
Equatorial does not agree with the interpretation of the 1993 agreement advanced by Errigal and the action will be defended vigorously.
v The acquisition has also resulted in a fair value adjustment to mining properties including those mining properties held by Minera El Tesoro of US$171.0 million, and a corresponding deferred tax provision of US$29.0 million.
vi The Group entered into an agreement to sell Equatorial Mining North America Inc. EMNA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equatorial.
Further details of the disposal are given in Note 28 b. vii Equatorial did not generate revenue in the period before or after acquisition by the Group, and its acquisition did not have any effect on the Group as its interest in El Tesoro was already consolidated as a subsidiary in the Groups financial statements.
The operating profit generated by Equatorial excluding its interest in El Tesoro which was already consolidated by the Group as a subsidiary for the period since acquisition was US$4.4 million.
If the acquisition of Equatorial had been completed on the first day of the financial year, its operating profit similarly excluding its interest in El Tesoro for the year would have been US$4.4 million.

The interest will be acquired by earning an equity interest in Compaia Minera DosRios S. A. DosRios, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ascendant which holds or will hold all of the mineral concessions associated with the Chaucha Project.
The Group has committed to fund at least US$1 million of expenditure after which it has the right to terminate the Agreement at any time and will subsequently earn its equity interest in successive stages by spending a total of US$40 million over a six-year period in four distinct phases of qualifying expenditures.
These expenditures will cover exploration and advancement costs including, in the later phases, preparation of a feasibility study and a final payment on completion to Ascendant.
No expenditure was incurred on this project during 2006. b Agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Limited On 14 July 2006 the Group reached agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Limited to form a joint venture to explore and develop copper and gold mining projects in southern Colombia.
Under the agreement, AngloGold will contribute its mineral interests in the area covered by the joint venture agreement, and the Group has committed to funding US$1.3 million in exploration over a one year period.
The Group may elect to fund an additional US$6.7 million in exploration within four years, in order to earn a 50% interest in the joint venture.
During 2006 the Group spent US$0.9 million on this project which has been included in exploration costs.

Details of the principal claims are set out below: a Los Pelambres Mauro tailings dam In November 2006, the Court of Appeals of Santiago upheld a challenge by claimants in the Pupio Valley against the Chilean Water Authority Direccion General fide Aguas in relation to the award of one of the sectoral permits issued during 2005 for the construction of the Mauro tailings dam by Los Pelambres.
In December, however, the Court of Appeals rejected a second request by the claimants that work on the dam should be suspended, and confirmed that Los Pelambres was entitled to continue construction pending a final resolution by the Chilean Supreme Court, to whom Los Pelambres have appealed as an affected party together with the Direccion General fide Aguas.
The Group believes that Los Pelambres has received all the necessary technical and legal permits and that these have been properly applied for and granted entirely in accordance with the applicable regulations.
It is confident that this view will be upheld by the Chilean Supreme Court.
There are other claims at first instance currently in the Chilean courts against third parties either governmental authorities or former owners of land in the El Mauro area.
These claims are not against Los Pelambres, but in some cases the company has intervened in case an eventual judgement affects the project.
b Equatorial Mining Limited - Errigal In July 2006, Equatorial Mining Limited Equatorial received notice of a claim by Errigal Limited in the New South Wales Supreme Court.
Errigal is a former minority shareholder in one of Equatorials subsidiaries whose interest was acquired by Equatorial in 1993.
The claim is for amounts payable under the 1993 acquisition agreement.
The Group does not agree with the interpretation of the 1993 agreement advanced by Errigal and the action will be defended vigorously.
c Tethyan Copper Company Limited Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture In November 2006, a Constitutional Petition was filed by three Pakistani citizens in the High Court of Balochistan at Quetta.
The petition is directed against several parties including the Company, the Government of Pakistan and the Government of Balochistan and seeks a declaration that the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture of 1993 and the exploration licences granted to Tethyan are null and void.
The petition will be contested vigorously and the Group remains confident that the exploration licences have been properly granted and that this view will be upheld.
36 Events After the Balance Sheet Date On 2 March 2007, the Group agreed to sell its 50% interest in Cordillera fide Las Minas S. A. CMSA to Panoro Minerals Limited Panoro, a company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.
CMSA was the joint venture entity with Companhia Vale Rio Doce through which its interests in southern Peru were held.
Subject to these conditions being met, closing is expected to occur by June 2007.
