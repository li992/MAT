Financial instruments Treasury management and strategy The Groups treasury activities are managed by its corporate finance department under the direction of a Treasury Review Committee whose chairman is the Chief Financial Officer, and are consistent with Board-approved treasury policies and guidelines.
The overriding objective of treasury activities is to manage financial risk.
Key features of treasury management include: ensuring that the Group is in a position to fund its obligations in appropriate currencies as they fall due: maintaining adequate undrawn borrowing facilities: economically hedging both contracted and anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a minimum twelve-month rolling basis with the option of covering exposures up to a maximum of three years forward: and maximising return on short-term investments.
Treasury activities are only transacted with counter parties who are approved relationship banks.
Treasury policy is implemented primarily through the use of forward purchases of foreign currencies.
The treasury department is, however, authorised to use purchased options, futures and other derivative instruments, but only to the extent that such instruments form part of the hedging policy so as to establish a known rate of exchange.
Having arranged the purchase of foreign currency in line with the anticipated requirement for that currency over each financial year, an average rate of exchange is calculated from the agreed currency deals.
This average rate is applied as per requirements of IAS21.
The policy is designed to minimise the impact of currency gains and losses in the Income Statement: gains and losses will arise to the extent that the level of actual payments in the period is different from those that were forecast.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 72 Net fair values of derivative financial instruments The Groups derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2006 consist of forward foreign currency contracts.
Derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2005 also included an interest rate swap and forward accrual contracts.
The interest rate swap and approximately 80% of forward foreign currency contracts are designated cash flow hedges.
The net fair values at the Balance Sheet date were: As at As at 31 December 31 December US$ in millions 2006 2005 Contracts with positive fair values: Interest rate swap designated cash flow hedge 2.3 Forward foreign currency contracts designated cash flow hedges 7.6 Forward foreign currency contracts undesignated 0.9 Contracts with negative fair values: Forward foreign currency contracts designated cash flow hedges 2.9 Forward foreign currency contracts undesignated 1.0 8.5 1.6 Less non-current portion Forward foreign currency contracts designated 0.3 Current portion 8.5 1.3 The fair value of foreign exchange contracts are based upon the difference between the contract amount at the current forward rate at each period end and the contract amount at the contract rate, discounted at a variable risk free rate at the period end.
The fair value of the interest rate swap was based upon a valuation provided by the counter-party.
Forward foreign exchange As at 31 December 2006 the face value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was 60.1m net fair value US$8.5m, all maturing in 2007.
As at 31 December 2005 the notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was 97.7m net fair value negative US$3.9m with the balance of 30.0m face value maturing in 2006 net fair value US$0.7m.
During 2006 the Group transacted spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
During 2005 the Group also transacted two forward accrual contracts whereby the Group entered into a series of monthly forward contracts at fixed rates and subject to exchange rates not reaching specified levels.
Interest rate swap The interest rate swap contract of US$150m expired in December 2006.
The notional principal amount outstanding as at 31 December 2005 was US$150m.
Under the interest rate swap the Group received quarterly floating interest three month USD LIBOR to offset floating interest payable on the three month facility rollovers and paid quarterly interest at a fixed rate of 3.21% p. a.
The gain deferred in equity recycled to the Income Statement when the swap expired in December 2006.
Non derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Non derivative financial assets consist of cash at bank, short-term and long-term investments, trade debtors and other debtors.
Non derivative financial liabilities consist of bank overdrafts, deferred satellite payments, Senior Credit Facilities, Senior Discount Notes, Senior Notes, accrued and accreted interest on borrowings, trade creditors and other creditors.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 73 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Fair value of non derivative financial assets and financial liabilities With the exception of Senior Discount Notes and Senior Notes, the fair values of all non derivative financial instruments approximate to the carrying value in the Balance Sheet.

The fair value of the Senior Notes and the Senior Discount Notes is based on the market price of the bonds as at 31 December 2006: b the fair values of cash at bank, overdrafts and short-term deposits approximate their carrying values because of the short maturity of these instruments: c the fair value of trade and other payables and receivables approximate their carrying values: d the carrying amount of deferred satellite payments represents the present value of future payments discounted at a variable risk-free rate at the period end.
This carrying amount approximately equals fair value: e Senior Credit Facilities are reflected in the Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2006 net of unamortised arrangement costs of US$1.6m 2005: US$2.3m.
The fair value approximates the carrying value.
Capital commitments The Group had authorised and contracted but not provided for capital commitments as at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 of US$139.0m and US$119.2m respectively.
These amounts primarily represent commitments in respect of the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite and BGAN services.
