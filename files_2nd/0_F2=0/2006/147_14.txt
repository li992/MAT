r Leases Rentals payable on operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
s Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards IFRIC4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease became applicable in 2006.
IFRIC4 contains guidance on determining whether arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease should nevertheless be accounted for in accordance with ISA17 Leases.
The Group uses the guidance of IFRIC4 in assessing its contracts for the purpose of identifying leases.
Other new standards and interpretations issued in 2006 have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
The future accounting standards that may affect the Group in 2007 and 2008 are as follows: IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures became effective 1 January 2007, consolidates IAS30 and the disclosure requirements of IAS32 relating to financial instruments.
We do not anticipate that this standard will have any material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS8 Operating Segments will replace IAS14 Segment Reporting and proposes that entities adopt a management approach to reporting financial performance.

Goodwill acquired through business contributions is allocated, at acquisition, to cash-generating units CGUs, that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discounts rates, growth rates and expected changes to day rates and direct costs in the period.
Management estimates discounts rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the CGUs.
Growth rates and changes in day rates and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years, due to the long-term nature of the relationships, based on an estimated real growth rate of 1.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the market.
The post-tax rate used to discount the cash flows is 8.4%.

The Group has in place a risk management policy that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments and other instruments to fix interest rates.
a Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks primarily with respect to the sterling, Euro and Norwegian kroner.
The Group has entered into various forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of its subsidiary companies.
At 31 December 2006, the longest-dated contract has a maturity date in August 2007. b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing borrowings.
The Groups policy is to maintain a significant percentage of its borrowings at fixed interest rates.
This is, in part, achieved by using interest rate swaps to fix interest rate exposures on certain variable rate borrowings.
At 31 December 2006, 46% 2005: 48% of current and non-current bank loans were at secured rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
c Credit risk Credit risk exposure primarily relates to receivables balances.
The Group requires that appropriate credit checks are performed on potential customers before sales commence.
The Groups customers are typically well established oil companies with solid credit ratings.
d Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
e Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk.

At 31 December 2006, the fixed interest rates were 5.54% two US dollar contracts, 5.10% sterling contract and 4.44% Norwegian kroner contract.

In addition, there was a US dollar interest rate collar contract with a floor rate at 5.005% and a capped rate of 6.00%.
The Groups hedged floating rate financial liabilities were at rates of 6.77% USD LIBOR plus 135 basis points, 6.46% GBP LIBOR plus 135 basis points and 4.80% NIBOR plus 135 basis points.
The interest rate swap contracts are effective hedges.
The fair value gains and losses relating to the interest rate swaps and which are deferred in equity at 31 December 2006 will reverse in the income statement over the term of the swaps.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The fair value of short-term borrowings approximate to carrying amounts.

Songa Drilling AS owns three jack-up rigs all of which were under refurbishment or repair at the date of acquisition.
The book value and the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition were: Book Fair value Provisional value adjustments fair value $000 $000 $000 Property, plant and equipment 222,578 50,000 272,578 Intangible fixed assets 36,734 36,734 Trade and other receivables 589 589 Cash and cash equivalents 49,402 49,402 Trade and other payables 28,704 28,704 Borrowings 177,183 3,725 180,908 Deferred tax liabilities 489 15,000 15,489 Net assets acquired 66,193 68,009 134,202 Goodwill 378,200 Consideration 512,402 Consideration satisfied by: Cash 241,688 Issue of shares 263,372 Direct costs relating to the acquisition 7,342 512,402 The purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.
All intangible assets were recognised at their fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
The goodwill is attributable to the strong demand for jack-up rigs which is having a positive impact on the future revenue generation potential.
When the Group completes the refurbishment and repair of the two remaining jack-up rigs this may give rise to subsequent fair value adjustments.
47,743,925 shares in Abbot Group plc were issued as part of this acquisition.
The closing share price at 7 June 2006 of 297.5p at an exchange rate of $1.855 1 rounded has been used to value this instrument.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of Songa Drilling AS is analysed as follows: $000 Cash consideration 241,688 Direct costs relating to the acquisition 7,342 Cash acquired 49,402 199,628 From the date of acquisition Songa Drilling AS contributed operating profits of $8,244,000 representing approximately three and a half months operation of one rig from commencement of operations in mid-September to year end.
In the period prior to acquisition the Company did not earn any income and losses were immaterial.
