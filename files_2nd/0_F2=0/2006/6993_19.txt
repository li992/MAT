Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 20 and has been adjusted for the issue of shares during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 31 March 2006.

Derivative financial instruments FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosure applies to the comparatives as a result of the exemption taken under IAS 32 as stated in the accounting policy note.
As a result, disclosures under this standard are given below for the comparatives, where disclosure requirements are different to those required under IAS 32.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest swaps and a cap.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used for currency exposures on next years expected purchases.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency transactions, which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the contracted rates.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant asset or borrowings effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.

Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 March 2006 will be released to the income statement at various dates between three and seven months from the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract at 31 March 2006 was 120m 2005: 140m.
At 31 March 2006 the fixed interest rate was 5.5875% and the floating rate is LIBOR.
Treasury policy The Groups objective in using financial instruments is to minimise its exposure to financial risk.
The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group: and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
The main risk arising from the Groups financial instruments is interest rate risk.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The latest policy review was performed in May 2006.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the next three to five years at a reasonable cost and ensure adequate flexibility to meet the changing needs of the enterprise.
Halfords Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial Statements 63 Notes to the Financial Statements 19.
Derivative Financial instruments continued Financial risk The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is dependent upon the level of the trading profit and the strength of the balance sheet.
Interest rate risk The Group maintains its policy to minimise interest rate risk on its borrowings and deposits by using interest rate derivatives where appropriate.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The aim is to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rates movements by hedging at least 75% of the following periods net interest rate exposure, whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct source purchases of its supplies from the Far East, with most of the trade being specifically US Dollar denominated.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business for a minimum period of twelve months forward to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling business whilst they remain immaterial.
Credit risk The Groups policy is to minimise the risk that foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties, the holders of surplus cash and the providers of debt will be unable to fulfil their obligations and also, in the case of lenders, will be unwilling to renegotiate the terms of the borrowings.
The Group ensures that such counterparties used for credit transactions hold at least an AA credit rating.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when required.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient funding to meet its Business Plan requirements so that it is not reliant on there being sufficient liquidity in the market when it needs the funding.
Fair values of non-derivative financial liabilities The following table is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 March 2006 and 1 April 2005.

Long-term borrowings The fair value of the Groups bonds has been estimated using quoted market prices.
In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to markets rates at intervals of less than one year.
As discussed above, the FRS 13 disclosures for the comparatives are as follows.
Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.

The effect of the Groups interest rate swap at 1 April 2005 was to classify 138.0m of sterling borrowings in the above table as fixed rate.
The Group has a sterling interest rate cap, which matures in June 2009.
In addition to the above, the Groups provisions of 1.2m note 17 met the definition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
This is because, in establishing the provisions, the cash flows are discounted and the discount rate reappraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflected the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

The Company has made annual grants in both the 52 weeks to 31 March 2006 and the 52 weeks to 1 April 2005.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 5% 2005: 6% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.

Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the executive directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Groups performance over the three financial years ending in March 2008.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Groups relative total shareholder return TSR performance compared with specific retailers and the vesting of the other 50% by the Groups earnings per share EPS performance against RPI.

Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS The Group reported under UK GAAP in its published financial statements for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2005.
The analysis below shows a reconciliation of net assets and profit as reported under UK GAAP for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2005 to the revised net assets and profit under IFRS as reported in these financial statements.
In addition, there is a reconciliation of net assets under UK GAAP to IFRS at the transition date for the Group being 3 April 2004.
Key impacts The main impacts of IFRS on the reported results of the Group are listed below and are described in greater detail in the following sections.
