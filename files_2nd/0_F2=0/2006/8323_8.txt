Interest Net interest expense excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 Liquidity mark to market movements at 248 million is 46 million higher than Free cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2006 was 2005.
This is mainly due to the impact of additional debt relating to the 456 million, an increase of 60% compared to the previous year acquisition of Coleto Creek, a full year impact of Saltend, which was 2005: 285 million.
This increase was driven by strong operational acquired in July 2005, and first time interest expense at Tihama, where and financial performance across the Group, together with higher interest costs ceased to be capitalised as the assets became operational dividends from joint ventures and associates.
This was partially offset in 2006. by increased tax and interest payments 86 million higher than 2005 and an increase in maintenance capital expenditure of 56 million.
Tax The tax charge excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements at 122 million is 54 million up on the 2005 charge.

This was offset by depreciation and amortisation charges and the impact of currency retranslation of 246 million, principally on our Australian and US dollar assets.
Long-term receivables and others increased by 685 million due to the acquisition of Levanto 278 million, which is accounted for as a number of finance leases, and the transfer of 344 million from property, plant and equipment to finance lease receivables at Tihama and Levanto, as further capacity became operational during the year.
Non-current liabilities have increased by 341 million mainly due to the recognition of a provision for 156 million at Coleto Creek in respect of out of the money contracts on acquisition and an increase in deferred tax liabilities of 139 million.
Net debt has increased during 2006 as a result of the acquisitions of Coleto Creek and Levanto and further capital expenditure at Tihama, partially offset by strong cash flow generation.

In addition, the Group has uncommitted bilateral credit lines from various banks at its disposal at the corporate level.
The Groups policy is to fix interest rates for a significant portion of the debt 71% as at 31 December 2006 using forward rate or interest rate swap agreements.
Turbogs interest costs are a pass through in the PPA tariff and therefore not an exposure to the Group.
Adjusting for this item would increase fixed rate debt to 77%.
The Group is broadly neutral to changes in interest rates as variable rate debt is similar in size to variable rate cash and cash equivalents.
Significant interest rate management programmes and instruments require specific approval of the Board.
The weighted average interest of the fixed rate debt was 7% in 2006.
Where project finance is utilised, our policy is to align the maturity of the debt with the contractual terms of the customer offtake agreement.
