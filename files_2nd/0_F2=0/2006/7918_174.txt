As a result of these standards, a number of financial instruments were recognised or revalued in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005, decreasing reserves by 63m.
This adjustment principally relates to own shares that the Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire, under forward contracts, to hedge its obligations under various share option schemes, partly offset by the release of a provision held under UK GAAP relating to the same liability.
