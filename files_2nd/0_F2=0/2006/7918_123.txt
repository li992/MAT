Under US GAAP, the disposal of Quest does not meet the criteria of held for sale and consequently the assets and liabilities are not disclosed separately, but presented as part of the balance sheet categories.
The effect of applying US GAAP to items other than those directly affecting net income or shareholders equity is dealt with in other notes relating to the accounts.
The disclosures required by SFAS No.

Statement of Group cash flow: Basis of preparation The statement of Group cash flow is prepared in accordance with IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements, the objective and presentation of which is similar to that set out in SFAS No.
The two statements differ, however, in their definitions of cash and cash equivalents with overdrafts being included under IFRS and excluded under US GAAP.
Notes relating to the differences between IFRS and US accounting principles: i Other intangible assets At 31 December 2006 under US GAAP, the Group had intangible assets other than goodwill with a gross carrying amount of 270m less accumulated amortisation of 257m.
The charge of 27m 2005 29m: 2004 36m relating to other intangible assets is due to an amortisation charge of 27m 2005 27m: 2004 29m and loss on disposal of a business of nil 2005 2m: 2004 7m.
The amortisation expense for the five succeeding years is estimated as follows: 2007 13m, 2008 nil, 2009 nil, 2010 nil and 2011 nil.
ii Discounted provisions The credit of 7m 2005 16m credit: 2004 14m charge arising on discounted provisions is due to the reversal of the discount unwind using a discount rate of 5.0% of 2m 2005 4m: 2004 2m and a release of 5m 2005 12m release: 2004 16m increase.
The undiscounted provision recognised under US GAAP at 31 December 2006 of 53m is 15m higher than the discounted provision held under IFRS 2005 22m higher.
iii Capitalisation of interest At 31 December 2006, the Group had capitalised interest with a gross carrying amount of 98m 2005 100m less accumulated amortisation of 72m 2005 75m.
The credit relating to capitalised interest of 7m 2005 charge 2m: 2004 charge 4m is the net of additions in the period of 11m 2005 3m: 2004 1m offset by an amortisation charge of 4m 2005 5m: 2004 5m.

During the year, the Group changed its reporting segments.
The National Starch business, previously reported as one segment, is now reported as four segments: Adhesives, Specialty Starches, Specialty Polymers and Electronic Materials.
This change reflects a move to global business units during 2006.
In accordance with SFAS No.
142, goodwill was reassigned to reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach.
The National Starch goodwill of 1,696m at 31 December 2006 was reassigned to Adhesives 662m, Specialty Starches 348m, Specialty Polymers 333m and Electronic Materials 353m.
In accordance with the accounting policy, goodwill impairment testing was performed at 31 December 2006 based on the new reporting unit structure.
v Derivative instruments and hedging activities The charge of 15m 2005 2m charge: 2004 15m charge under the line item net investment hedge represents the reversal of the exchange gain recognised under IFRS on the part of the debt that cannot be hedged.
This is recognised directly in reserves under US GAAP, but in the income statement under IFRS.
The Group mark-to-market all derivatives under IFRS and US GAAP.
The credit of 24m 2005 25m credit: 2004 12m charge relating to the mark-to-market of derivatives represents the movement in the employee share ownership plan ESOP forward contracts to purchase own shares that are out of the money of 22m 2005 22m credit: 2004 10m credit and an amount of 2m 2005 3m credit: 2004 3m credit representing the partial unwind of transition adjustments for the adoption of SFAS No.
In 2004, the Group did not designate any of its derivative instruments as hedges for US GAAP accounting purposes.
The income statement reconciliation in 2004 includes a charge of 25m for the adjustment to fair value of the Groups derivatives in 2004 the Group took the exemption in IFRS not to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 and therefore amounts were accounted for under UK GAAP.
The difference in amounts recognised on the balance sheet under IFRS and US GAAP of 109m 2005 98m under the heading Financial liabilities include the reduction in liabilities relating to ESOP forward contracts of 96m 2005 87m and transition adjustments of 1m 2005 3m relating to the adoption of SFAS No.
133 additional liability and a reduction in liabilities of 14m 2005 14m upon adoption of IAS 39. vi Restructuring costs The charge of 2m 2005 3m credit relating to restructuring arises from the difference in employee termination.
In 2003, the Group undertook a series of restructuring programmes to improve cost effectiveness across each of its business segments.
A charge of 201m was recognised under UK GAAP of which 48m related to asset write-downs.
The asset write-downs related to assets to be abandoned and were recognised in connection with FRS 11 since the carrying value of the assets exceeded the recoverable amount.
In making the assessment of recoverable amount under UK GAAP decisions were made on an individual asset basis.
Under US GAAP, as the assets formed part of larger, profitable cash generating units, no impairment was recognised.
However, the remaining lives of the assets were adjusted and the charge of 47m in the 2004 UK GAAP and IFRS to US GAAP reconciliations represented the catch up accelerated depreciation under US GAAP.
Under the exemptions provided in IFRS 1 paragraphs 16 and 17, the fixed asset values were included at the date of transition to IFRS at the impaired UK GAAP value resulting in the GAAP difference in the 2004 IFRS to US GAAP income statement reconciliation.
vii Inventory write-down The credit of 3m 2005 7m charge: 2004 nil represents the net of amounts reinstated at the prior year end and utilised the current period and reinstatement of inventory write-downs recognised under IFRS in the current period.
