Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2006 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 'UK GAAP' and with the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies December 2005.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The new Financial Reporting Standards, issued as part of the programme to enable UK GAAP to converge with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, were applicable for the accounting period ended 30 June 2006 and the financial statements for the twelve months ended 30 June 2005 have also been restated see note 17.
The main change arising from these revisions to UK GAAP, in relation to the Company's financial statements, are that dividends to shareholders declared after the balance sheet date are now shown in the period of payment rather than in the reporting period and investments are fair valued at bid price having previously been valued on a mid basis.
Dividends were previously recognised in the Statement of Total Return now the Income Statement but these are now dealt with as an appropriation of equity and are taken directly through equity in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders' Funds.
The impact of these changes are shown in note 17. b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends are treated as revenue for the year on an exdividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses are charged against revenue in the income account except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are charged to capital: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Murray Income Trust PLC 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Due to the Company's status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Company's effective rate of tax for the year.
e Valuation of Investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchange's electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the unrealised capital reserve.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company's financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of managing currency and market risk arising from the Company's activities.
During the year the Company entered into two traded options.
Details of these are provided in the Portfolio of Investments table on pages 20 and 21.
The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market price risk, being the risk that the value of the investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement ii interest rate risk iii liquidity risk and iv credit risk.
In line with the Company's investment objective, the portfolio comprises UK securities and therefore has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
In order to mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting, market and sector analysis.
It is the Boards' policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
The Attribution Analysis, detailing the allocation of assets and the stock selection, is shown on page 14.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Current strategy is detailed in the Chairman's Statement on page 10 and in the Investment Manager's Review on pages 14 to 17.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks.
The Board has agreed the level of gearing, which was 5.4% of net assets as at 30 June 2006.
The Manager's policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numerical disclosures in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The Company's investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out on page 1.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowings powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Manager's Review on pages 14 to 17.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Company's operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Board's policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is on page 11 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is on pages 20 and 21.
Interest rate risk Financial assets The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
Murray Income Trust PLC 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Floating rate Interest bearing Non-interest bearing 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 restated restated '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Sterling 100 2,700 7,992 2,880 472,719 414,672 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The interest bearing assets represent the preference share, amounting to 3,495,000 2005 2,880,000, and the equity linked note, amounting to 4,497,000 2005 nil, of the portfolio.
The weighted average interest rate on the preference share, based on current yield, is 4.43% 2005 5.37% and on the equity linked note, based on current yield, is 8.47% 2005 nil.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Financial liabilities The Company has borrowings by way of a loan facility, details of which are in note 11.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Maturity profile The maturity profile of the Company's financial assets at 30 June 2006 was as follows: At 30 June 2006 Within 1 year '000 Fixed rate Equity linked note 4,497 Preference share 3,495 7,992 Floating rate Cash 100 At 30 June 2005 Within Within 1 year 1-2 years Total '000 '000 '000 Fixed rate Preference share 2,880 2,880 Floating rate Cash 2,700 2,700 All the other financial assets and liabilities do not have a maturity date.
52 Murray Income Trust PLC Liquidity risk The Company's assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Manager's research of potential investee companies.
The Company's custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company and their performance is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The maximum credit risk at 30 June 2006 is 1,815,000 30 June 2005 1,443,000 consisting of 1,815,000 2005 1,433,000 of dividends receivable from equity shares.
Taxation There is no taxation charge for the year.
Approved investment trusts are exempt from tax on gains made by the Company.
The tax assessed for the period is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2005 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2006 2005 '000 '000 Revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation 14,425 13,711 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by the applicable rate of corporation tax of 30% 4,328 4,113 2005 30% Effects of: Non-taxable UK dividends 5,099 4,899 Unutilised loan relationships 109 136 Unutilised management expenses 662 564 Disallowable expenses 86 No provision for deferred tax has been made in the current or prior accounting period.
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 12,430,000 2005 10,714,000 arising as a result of having unutilised management expenses, as it is considered unlikely that there will be taxable profits against which these expenses may be utilised.
Any excess management expenses will be utilised against any taxable income that may arise.
Restatement for first time adoption of revised UK GAAP As stated in the accounting policies, the Board has elected to continue to adopt UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP and therefore complies with the new Financial Reporting Standards issued as part of the programme to converge UK GAAP with IFRS.
Figures for the years ended 30 June 2004 and 2005 have been restated and the impact of these changes are shown below.
Murray Income Trust PLC 53 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Under FRS 26 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' investments should be valued at their fair value which is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS stocks sourced from The London Stock Exchange.
Previously, listed investments other than SETS stocks were values at mid market prices.
The financial statements for the years ended 30 June 2004 and 2005 have been restated to show investments at their fair value.
Under FRS 21 'Events after the Balance Sheet Date' dividends should only be accrued in the accounts if they are a liability at the Balance Sheet date, therefore they are now recognised in the period in which they are paid, not in the period in which they are proposed.
No provision has therefore been made for the third interim dividend and the final dividend on Ordinary shares for the years ended 30 June 2005 and 2006.
The financial statements for the years ended 30 June 2004 and 2005 have been restated to remove these dividends that were accrued at those dates.
Dividends are no longer recognised through the Income Statement but rather these are taken to the Statement of Movements in Shareholders' Funds as an appropriation of equity.
