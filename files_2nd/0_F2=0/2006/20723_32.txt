Credit Risk The Group's principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is relatively low because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
