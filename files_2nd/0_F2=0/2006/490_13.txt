The measurement of this expense is calculated only on options granted after 7th November 2002.
The estimated cost of share-based payments requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model, consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen and the estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, inputs for which arise from judgements relating to the probability of meeting non-market performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees.
Any awards that do not ultimately vest are lapsed.
Dividends The final dividend is only recognised at the point it is declared and approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised on payment.
Provisions Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products still under warranty.
Product warranties of between one and three years are given, where appropriate, by individual businesses in the Group.
Following the disposal programme of previous years certain vacant properties located in the UK remain with the Group.
Full provision has been made for the residual onerous lease commitments, together with other outgoings, for the remaining period of the leases.
The Group's other provisions relate to the remaining costs in respect of the disposal of Pipe Systems, including probable warranty and indemnity claims, other claims and other costs from third parties in relation to divested businesses.
Provisions are not discounted where the effect is not material.
Investments Investments are included at cost.
Non-recurring costs The Group presents as non-recurring items on the face of the income statement, those items of income and expense which, because of the non-recurring nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
There are four main segments, as shown above.
UK & European Consumer includes the Aga, Rangemaster, Fired Earth, Waterford Stanley and Grange brands operating mainly in the UK and Europe.
The US Consumer segment includes the Aga Ranges, Heartland and Marvel brands and operates mainly in North America.

US Foodservice includes the Adamatic, Amana, Belshaw and Victory brands operating mainly in North America.
All segments have similar customer bases, bringing together operations selling into particular markets and working together to optimise sales in those markets.
The discontinued operation relates to the soft furnishings line of business at Domain.
Revenue between UK & European Consumer and US Consumer was 6.3m 2005: 2.7m.
Revenue between other business groups whilst growing is not material.
Segment assets include property, plant and equipment, intangibles, inventories and receivables.

Foodservice Group Notes to the accounts 5.
Pensions The Group operates a pension scheme which covers the majority of United Kingdom employees.
Membership on a defined benefit basis was closed in 2001 but the scheme remains open to new entrants on a defined contribution basis.
The assets are held in trust funds separate from the Groups assets although they are included in the Groups balance sheet.
Other defined benefit schemes operated within the Group are the Mono Equipment Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, the Amari plc Pension and Life Assurance Plan and various overseas arrangements.
Various defined contribution schemes exist across the Group and the total contributions in the year were 1.4m 2005: 0.4m included in staff costs, in note 4.
The latest full valuation of the main United Kingdom scheme was carried out by Watson Wyatt Limited, independent consulting actuaries, as at 31st December 2005 using the projected unit credit method.
Group defined benefit scheme contributions of 4.8m 2005: 4.9m based on pensionable salaries and an additional contribution of 1.0m were made during the year ended 31st December 2006.
Company contributions of 0.4m 2005: 0.4m were owed to the schemes at 31st December 2006.
Contributions for 2007 under the main UK scheme will be 13.9% 2006: 12.8% for all members accruing benefits on a final salary basis with the exception of members of the former 1970 scheme and 27.4% 2006: 32.8% for members of the former 1970 scheme.
Company contributions of around 9.5m are expected to be paid to this scheme during 2007 and include a further 4.5m of additional contributions.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit schemes liabilities under IAS 19 were: UK European UK European schemes 2006 schemes 2006 schemes 2005 schemes 2005 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9% 3.0 - 4.0% 4.0% 3.0 - 4.0% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.25 - 3.3% - 2.25 - 3.2% - Discount rate 5.2% 4.0 - 4.3% 4.8% 3.8 - 4.4% Inflation rate 2.9% 2.0% 2.5% 2.0 - 2.5% Expected rate of return on schemes assets 6.25% 4.5% 6.0% 5.4% The overall expected rate of return on assets is the average of the best estimate for the expected long-term rate of return for each of the major asset classes weighted according to the percentage allocation of the aggregated assets to each of the asset classes at the reporting date.
The demographic assumptions used include rates for mortality which, for example, generally lead to an average projected life expectancy of 17.9 years for male members currently aged 65 and of 19.1 years from age 65 for male members currently aged 50.
The comparable projections under IAS 19 as at 31st December 2005, after taking account of a difference in methodology as at the comparative date, were effectively 17.1 years and 18.1 years respectively.

The foreign exchange impact on the overseas schemes is not significant.
The impact on the deficit in the overseas schemes of the Eloma acquisition is 0.3m.
The pension schemes have not invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments nor in properties or other assets used by the Group.

Earnings per share The basic earnings per share for total operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential shares the share options granted to employees and the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The earnings and weighted average number of shares are set out below: 2006 2005 Earnings for the purpose of the basic and diluted EPS m m Profit after tax from continuing operations 37.0 34.1 Minority interests - 0.4 Earnings for basic and diluted EPS 37.0 33.7 Loss profit from discontinued operations 5.9 0.3 Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent 31.1 34.0 Weighted average number of shares in issue million million For basic EPS calculation 128.9 127.6 Dilutive effect of share options and Long-Term Incentive Plans 1.1 0.8 For diluted EPS calculation 130.0 128.4 Earnings per share Continuing operations p p Basic 28.7 26.4 Diluted 28.5 26.3 Discontinued operations p p Basic 4.6 0.2 Diluted 4.6 0.2 Total operations p p Basic 24.1 26.6 Diluted 23.9 26.5 11.

c Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts The Group uses finance leases and hire purchase contracts to acquire plant and machinery.
These leases have terms of renewal but no purchase options or escalation clauses.
Renewals are at the option of the lessee.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are as follows: 2006 2005 Future minimum payments due: m m Not later than one year 0.2 0.4 After one year but not more than five years 0.3 2.0 0.5 2.4 Less finance charges allocated to future periods - 0.1 Present value of minimum lease payments 0.5 2.3 The present value of minimum lease payments is analysed as follows: m m Not later than one year 0.2 0.4 After one year but not more than five years 0.3 1.9 0.5 2.3 Foodservice Group Notes to the accounts 20.
Financial instruments a Forward foreign exchange contracts As a result of the Groups geographical presence and operations, forward foreign currency contracts put in place are primarily denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
There were no forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at the balance sheet date 2005: 0.1m.
As at 31st December 2006, the notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was committed to were GBP3.9m 2005: GBP2.8m, CHF1.9m 2005: CHF1.6m, EUR1.4m 2005: EUR6.3m and USD5.6m 2005: USD8.4m.
The fair value of these open forward foreign exchange contracts are equivalent to their carrying amount.
The contracts have been put in place to mitigate the foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchase commitments and mature over the next twelve months.
b Hedge of net investment in foreign entities The Group has Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings, which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in Europe and the US.
The fair value of such Euro borrowings at 31st December 2006 was 29.7m 2005: 27.4m and the fair value of the US Dollar borrowings was 17.2m 2005: 2.1m.
The exchange difference on the translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in translation reserves.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.
c Interest rate risk The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are equivalent to their book value at the balance sheet date.
In respect of financial assets and liabilities, the following table indicates their interest rate basis and the periods in which they mature.
Floating rate borrowings are repriced within six months from the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments continued d Liquidity risk The Group maintains a mixture of short-term uncommitted and medium-term committed facilities to ensure a sufficient level of funds are available for its business operations.
The committed facilities have been arranged to help finance the expansion of the Groups activities.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
The following table analyses the Group's principal undrawn committed facilities at the year-end: 2006 2005 m m Expiring within 1 year 20.0 - Expiring between 1 and 2 years 11.1 30.5 Expiring between 2 and 5 years 9.6 30.0 Total undrawn committed facilities 40.7 60.5 In addition to the committed facilities detailed above, the Group also has uncommitted facilities totalling 51.0m 2005: 41.0m.
e Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date.

Property and reorganisation Following the disposal programme of previous years certain vacant property located in the UK remain with the Group.
Full provision has been made for the residual lease commitments, together with other outgoings, for the remaining period of the leases.
The timing of payments on vacant properties is 0.1m repayable in less than one year and 0.3m greater than one year.
The reorganisation provision includes costs associated with announced reorganisations within the Group which occurred during the year.
Other The Groups other provisions relate to the remaining costs in respect of the disposal of Pipe Systems in 2001, including possible warranty and indemnity claims, other claims and other costs from third parties in relation to divested businesses.
Although the majority of these provisions may be realised in the next accounting period, the exact timing is unclear.

Further information is set out in the remuneration report on pages 29 to 33.
Share based payments The Senior Executive Share Option Scheme was approved in 1994.
Under the scheme the remuneration committee was able to grant options over shares in the Company to senior executives of the Group, although the scheme lapsed in May 2004.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under the option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option was ten years.
Options granted under the scheme will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the Groups earnings per share exceeding, by at least 3% per annum, the increase in the UKs retail price index over a period of three years beginning not earlier than the Companys last financial year before the date of an option grant.
The exercise of an option is subject to continued employment or other circumstances in the scheme rules.
Options granted since November 2002 were valued using Black-Scholes option model.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 1999 as an appropriate method to incentivise executives and senior management.
The LTIP consists of a right to acquire shares at a nominal price of 1 which will be exercisable after a period of three years at the earliest.
The actual percentage of shares that can be acquired depends on two performance criteria.
The first of these is a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return TSR with the TSR of companies in a comparator approved by the remuneration committee at the date of grant and the second is that the remuneration committee determines that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company see remuneration report on pages 29 to 33.

The expected life is the average expected to exercise.
A Monte-Carlo model was used to value TSR performance conditions for the LTIP.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payment plans was 0.4m 2005: 0.4m before tax and 0.3m post tax.
