Notes to the Group Accounts continued 22 Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued A deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses where current projections show that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the near future against which these losses may be offset.
2006 2005 m m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Tax losses 11.0 11.3 The tax losses above have not been recognised as recoverability is uncertain.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was expected to be 6.0 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Further, the Group has sufficient capital losses to fully offset the 6.0m liability.
