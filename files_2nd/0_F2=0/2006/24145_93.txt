EEV assumptions continued 10.3 Other assumptions Other assumptions are regularly reviewed having regard to past, current and expected future experience, and any other relevant data.
These are set so as to be best estimate assumptions.
The assumed rates of mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender, conversion to paid-up and early retirement, which are reviewed annually, have been derived from analyses of the Groups recent operating experience and industry studies.
In particular, improvements in annuitant mortality have been assumed to follow the medium cohort for males and 75% of this for females.
Allowance for commission is based on the Groups recent experience.
