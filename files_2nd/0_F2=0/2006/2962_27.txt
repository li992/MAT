SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected consolidated financial data presented below for fiscal 2002 through 2006 and as of the end of each such year, are derived from our audited financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes.
Accordingly, the information from 2003 and thereafter is not comparable to the prior period.
Certain of these amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of changing our method of accounting for dry-dock costs from the deferral method to the direct expense method.
In addition, the 2006 net income was reduced by $57 million of share-based compensation expense related to our adoption of SFAS No.
123 R in 2006 see Note 2. b In accordance with cruise industry practice, occupancy percentage is calculated using a denominator of two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers.
The percentages in excess of 100% indicate that more than two passengers occupied some cabins.
c Percentage of total debt to the sum of total debt and shareholders equity.
