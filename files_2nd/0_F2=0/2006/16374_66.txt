The reassessment is based on the relative fair values of the segments at the time of the implementation of the new operating framework and results in a reallocation of goodwill and associated currency retranslation effects during 2005 from Europe and The Americas regions of 0.1 billion and 1.1 billion respectively into the Asia Africa region.
Segmental amounts for 2005 have been amended to reect this allocation.

In 2006, we reviewed the structure of our secondary reporting segments in the light of the planned disposal of the majority of our European frozen foods businesses.
As a consequence we are presenting the main product areas in four reporting segments, as opposed to six reporting segments in 2005.
We have presented the information on this basis, as the products in each of the four reported segments are substantially similar in nature, and combining the segments provides more meaningful information.
Information for prior years has been restated accordingly.
Savoury, dressings and spreads including sales of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, olive oil, margarines and spreads, and cooking products such as liquid margarines.
Ice cream and beverages including sales of ice cream, tea, weight management products, and nutritionally enhanced staples sold in developing markets.
Personal care including sales of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and anti-perspirants, and oral care products.
Home care and other operations including sales of home care products, such as laundry powders and liquids, and a wide range of cleaning products.
To support our consumer brands, we own tea plantations and palm oil plantations, the results of which are reported within this segment.
