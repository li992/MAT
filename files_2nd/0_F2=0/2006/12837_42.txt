23 Retirement benets Overview The company operates retirement benefit schemes for most of its United Kingdom and overseas subsidiaries.
The following three dened benefit schemes are the Groups main schemes, which are based and administered in the UK: Main staff plan for all eligible UK based staff, excluding PZ Cussons Plc executive directors.
Directors plan for PZ Cussons Plc executive directors.
Expatriate plan for all eligible expatriate staff based outside the UK.
Employees within these schemes are provided with dened benets based on service and final salary.
The assets of the schemes are administered by trustees and are held in trust funds independent of the company.
The Group also operates an unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit scheme.
The cost of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit scheme is included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 Employee benets and the assumptions set out below.
In accordance with these unfunded arrangements, the Group has made payments to former directors of 0.2 million in total in the year ended 31st May 2006 2005: nil.
The last triennial actuarial valuations of the schemes administered in the UK were performed by independent professional actuaries at 1st June 2003 using the projected unit method of valuation.
The Groups balance sheet at 31st May 2006 reects a pension surplus of 23.4 million 2005: 23.1 million in respect of the Expatriate plan, and combined deficits in the Staff and Directors plans of 24.8 million 2005: 25.1 million and 5.7 million 2005: 2.8 million respectively.
For the year to 31st May 2006 the total dened benefit pension cost arising from the three schemes amounted to 3.4 million 2005: 4.6 million.
The major financial assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: 31st May 31st May 2006 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 3.70% 4.70% Rate of increase in retirement benets in payment 2.70% 2.70% Discount rate 5.10% 5.10% Ination assumption 2.70% 2.70% | | 64 ANNUAL REPORT 2006 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Retirement benets continued The assets in the schemes and the expected rates of return were: 31st May 31st May 2006 2005 m m Equities 6.70% 117.7 6.40% 97.2 Bonds 4.50% 93.5 4.20% 90.4 Cash 4.25% 3.8 4.00% 7.1 Total fair value of scheme assets 215.0 194.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 222.1 199.5 deficit in the schemes 7.1 4.8 Related deferred tax asset 2.1 1.5 Net retirement benefit deficit 5.0 3.3 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the company considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments, the historic level of the risk premium associated with the other asset class in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each class of asset.
The expected return for each class of asset was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on plan assets was 21.9 million 2005: 20.8 million.
The net retirement benefit expense before taxation recognised in the income statement in respect of the dened benefit schemes is summarised as follows: 31st May 31st May 2006 2005 m m Current service cost 4.8 4.7 Past service cost 0.5 Expected return on scheme assets 10.3 10.3 Interest cost 10.2 10.2 Curtailment gain 1.8 Net retirement benefit expense before taxation 3.4 4.6 All above amounts are all recognised in the Groups income statement before arriving at operating profit.
