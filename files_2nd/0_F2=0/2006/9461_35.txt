On 13 October 2006 and 24 October 2006, the company issued 337,503,074 and 40,345,558 shares respectively to acquire a 95.33% interest in WM-data.
On the same dates, the company issued 8,318,096 and 697,713 shares to acquire a 96.48% holding in WM-data convertible debentures.
In 2005, the group announced a rights issue to part-fund the proposed acquisition of Unilog and 375,495,147 new ordinary shares of 10 pence each were issued at 107 pence per share on the basis of one new ordinary share for every two existing ordinary shares held.
The weighted average number of shares for the year ended 31 December 2005 has been adjusted for the bonus element within the rights issue.
Adjusted earnings per share, both basic and diluted, have been shown as the directors consider this to be helpful for a better understanding of the performance of the groups underlying business.
The earnings measure used in adjusted earnings per share excludes, whenever such items occur: the results of discontinued operations: exceptional items: mark-to-market gains or losses on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through pro t or loss: and amortisation of intangible assets initially recognised at fair value in a business combination.
All items adjusted are net of tax where applicable.
The weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by employee share ownership plan ESOP trusts, which are treated as cancelled.
The convertible bonds were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2006 and 2005 as they were anti-dilutive: however, the convertible bonds are dilutive for the purposes of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005.
The impact of the charge for share-based payments was to reduce adjusted basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2006 by 0.8 pence per share 2005: 0.7 pence per share.
