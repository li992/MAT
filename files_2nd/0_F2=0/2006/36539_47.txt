FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of the groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The groups risk management policies and practices are as follows: DEBT MANAGEMENT The group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Medium and long-term debt mainly comprises the groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to floating rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the groups ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
The Company has interest rate swaps of 300.0 million 2005: 176.4 million maturing within the next five years.
Under these swaps the Company receives interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% 2005: 6.0% and pays interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of these swaps was a liability of 8.8 million 2005: 7.3 million asset.
The group does not hedge account its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
FOREIGN CURRENCy MANAGEMENT The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in France and Germany, the group has designated both euro denominated bonds and currency swaps as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2006 was 1,007.5 million 2005: 548.0 million and their fair value was 1,018.2 million 2005: 578.9 million.
At 31 December 2006 the group had currency swaps of 247.8 million, being F369.2 million sold forward against sterling for value on 3 January 2007, at a rate of 1 F1.490.
At 31 December 2005 the group had swaps of 68.7 million, being F100.0 million sold forward against sterling for value on 31 January 2006, at a rate of 1 F1.455.
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments are recognised in equity.
PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT AND BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT The group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover and gearing.
Management monitors the groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
CASH MANAGEMENT Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
CREDIT RISK The groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts in notes 15 and 16 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and tenants.

The table excludes the impact on effective interest rates at the balance sheet date of foreign currency swaps.

Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2006, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the groups annual profit before tax by approximately 4.2 million 2005: 7.4 million.
The effect of interest rate swaps has been included in this estimate.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of the euro against sterling would have had no impact on the groups profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2006 2005: increase in profit before tax of 0.2 million.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.
