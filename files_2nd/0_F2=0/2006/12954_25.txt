23 NON GAAP INFORMATION Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are non GAAP measures.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce are calculated using guidance issued by the Gold Institute.
The Gold Institute was a non profit industry association comprised of leading gold producers, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers.
This institute has now been incorporated into the National Mining Association.
The guidance was first issued in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institutes guidance, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from deferred stripping where relevant, and royalties.
Under the companys revised accounting policies, there are no transfers to and from deferred stripping.
84 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 23 NON GAAP INFORMATION CONTINUED Total cash costs per ounce are calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute guidance, by gold ounces produced for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures or an indicator of our performance.
The data does not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore amounts presented may not be comparable to data presented by gold producers who do not follow the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
In particular depreciation, amortisation and share-based payments would be included in a measure of total costs of producing gold under IFRS, but are not included in total cash costs under the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
Furthermore, while the Gold Institute has provided a definition for the calculation of total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce, the calculation of these numbers may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, Randgold Resources believes that total cash costs per ounce is a useful indicator to investors and management of a mining company's performance as it provides an indication of a company's profitability and efficiency, the trends in cash costs as the company's operations mature, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are calculated by deducting royalties from total cash costs.
Cash operating costs per ounce are calculated by dividing cash operating costs by gold ounces produced for the periods presented.
Gold sales and the average price received are non GAAP measures.
Gold sales represents the sales of gold at spot and the gains losses on hedge contacts which have been delivered into at the designated maturity date.
It excludes gains losses on hedge contracts which have been rolled forward to match future sales.
This adjustment is considered appropriate because no cash is received paid in respect of these contracts.
Average price received is calculated by dividing gold sales by gold ounces sold.
These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and should not be regarded as an alternative to the revenue measures presented under IFRS.
Profit from mining activity is calculated by subtracting total cash costs from gold sales for all periods presented.
The following table reconciles gold sales, total cash costs and profit from mining activity, as non GAAP measures, to the information provided in the income statement, determined in accordance with IFRS, for each of the years set forth below: Year Year ended ended 31 Dec 31 Dec US$0000 2006 2005 Gold sales on spot 274 907 151 502 Loss on matured hedges 12 190 - Gold sales# 262 717 151 502 Mine production costs 115 217 66 612 Movement in production inventory and ore stock piles 13 373 18 744 Transport and refining costs 711 360 Royalties 16 979 10 273 General and administration expenses 13 006 7 438 Total cash costs 132 540 65 939 Profit from mining activity 130 177 85 563 Depreciation and amortisation 22 844 11 910 Exploration and corporate expenditure 28 805 24 049 Interest and other income 8 552 3 367 Other losses gains - net 653 45 Exchange losses gains - net and other expenses 2 216 3 129 Interest expense 5 825 1 861 Non-cash loss on roll forward of hedges 4 413 - Profit before income tax 73 973 48 026 Restated due to change in accounting policy relating to deferred stripping.
