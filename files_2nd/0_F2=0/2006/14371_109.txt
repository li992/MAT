Notes 1 General Information As the Groups principal assets and operations are in the US and the majority of its operations are conducted in US dollars, the Group changed its presentational currency from Pounds Sterling to US dollars with effect from 1 January 2006.
The Company redenominated its share capital into US dollars on 23 January 2006 and will retain distributable reserves and declare dividends in US dollars.
Consequently, its functional currency became the US dollar.
This lowers the Groups exposure to currency translation risk on its revenue, pro ts and equity.
Financial information for prior periods has been restated from Pounds Sterling into US dollars in accordance with IAS 21.
The prior year comparatives have been restated for the following items: a To correct the method of calculating the elimination of intra-group pro t carried in inventory, the effect of which is to reduce the amount of overhead expense included in inventory valuation.
The impact of correcting this error is to reduce inventory at 31 December 2005 by $53 million and trading pro t for the year ended 31 December 2005 by $9 million.
In addition, deferred tax assets at 31 December 2005 increased by $17 million and taxation for the year ended 31 December 2005 reduced by $3 million.
b A change in accounting policy for the recognition of the death-in-service bene ts liability in the UK pension plan.
Under IFRS alternative treatments are permissible: however management believes that it is more appropriate to apply the projected unit credit method rather than the value at risk approach previously adopted as this better re ects the Groups obligations and costs.
The effect of adopting this policy has been to increase the retirement bene t obligation under IFRS by $17 million at 31 December 2006 and $16 million at 31 December 2005 and decrease deferred tax liabilities by $5 million at 31 December 2006 and $5 million at 31 December 2005.
There is an immaterial impact on trading pro t and finance income in both years presented.
2 Segmental Information At the beginning of 2006 the Orthopaedics business, previously reported in the full accounts of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2005, was restructured into two separate businesses with separate management in order to improve focus on the distinct market segments of Reconstruction and Trauma and Clinical Therapies.
