Impairment As part of its business review, management has identified impairment losses of 5.1m relating to trading performance issues at properties held in the companys books.
The impairment losses identified represent the difference between the book values of properties and their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using the groups weighted average cost of capital.
The company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The growth rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant post-tax markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast post-tax cash flows for all CGUs is the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.0% 2004 05: 6.6%.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows.
