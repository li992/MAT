The geographic segments disclose revenue, operating profit and operating assets and liabilities by destination and reflect management responsibility.
Within each geographic segment the Group sells both Food and General Merchandise and secondary segment disclosure is given for revenue.
Given that both Food and General Merchandise are sold from the same locations it is not practical to provide segmental information on operating assets and capital expenditure at this level.
The Groups geographical segments are United Kingdom and International Retail.
The International segment consists of the Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland and Hong Kong, together with franchise operations.
The geographic segment results are as follows: Revenue Operating profit Operating assets Operating liabilities 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m m m m m United Kingdom Before exceptional operating charges 7,275.0 7,034.7 784.5 588.3 Exceptional operating charges 60.3 7,275.0 7,034.7 784.5 528.0 4,431.2 4,443.2 1,630.7 1,084.7 International Retail Before exceptional operating charges 522.7 455.8 65.6 60.4 Exceptional operating charges 9.7 522.7 455.8 65.6 70.1 214.5 215.2 81.5 60.0 Total 7,797.7 7,490.5 850.1 598.1 4,645.7 4,658.4 1,712.2 1,144.7 Assets liabilities from 1 discontinued operation 69.5 59.3 20.5 17.1 Total non-operating assets liabilities 495.3 149.6 2,322.5 2,796.3 Total assets liabilities 5,210.5 4,867.3 4,055.2 3,958.1 1 The assets and liabilities in the comparative period relate only to Kings Super Markets.

The value of goods exported from the UK, including shipments to international subsidiaries, amounted to 367.6m last year 319.9m.
The Group completed the sale of Marks and Spencer Retail Financial Services Holdings Limited to HSBC Holdings plc on 9 November 2004.
At the same time, the Group and HSBC entered into a relationship under which the Group continues to share in the success of the business.
Under this relationship, the Group receives income in the form of fees representing an amount equivalent to costs incurred, 50% of the profits of M&S Money after a notional tax charge and after deducting agreed operating and capital costs together with an amount relating to sales growth.
In the current year, a net operating profit of 9.6m has been recorded and is included within the results for UK Retail.

8 EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax last year earnings after tax and non-equity dividends, and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The adjusted earnings per share figures have been calculated in addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33 Earnings per Share and is based on earnings excluding the effect of exceptional items and asset disposals.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

This has a defined benefit section, which was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002, and a defined contribution section which has been open to new members with effect from 1 April 2003.
The defined benefit section operates on a Final Salary basis and at the year end had some 31,000 active members last year 35,000, 57,000 deferred members last year 56,000 and 38,000 pensioners last year 36,000.
At the year end, the defined contribution section had some 5,000 active members last year 4,000.
The Group also operates small defined benefit pension schemes in the Republic of Ireland and at Kings Super Markets in the USA.
Retirement benefits also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded pension plans.
Within the total Group retirement benefit cost of 80.7m last year 84.8m, 69.1m last year 74.0m relates to the UK defined benefit section, 5.6m last year 4.6m to the UK defined contribution section and 6.0m last year 6.2m to other retirement benefit schemes.
The Groups accounting policy for recognising actuarial gains and losses is to recognise these immediately through the statement of recognised income and expense.

The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 1 April 2006: 2006 2005 % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.7 3.7 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service: pre April 1997 2.4 2.5 between April 1997 and July 2005 2.9 2.9 post July 2005 2.1 2.4 Discount rate 4.9 5.5 Inflation rate 2.9 2.9 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.9 7.9 C Demographic assumptions The demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
One of the most significant demographic assumptions underlying the valuation is mortality.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the Scheme for the period to 2003 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent three years.
The specific mortality rates used are based on the PMA92 and PFA92 tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2006 2005 Years Years Current pensioners at age 65 males 18.8 18.6 Current pensioners at age 65 females 22.6 22.4 Future pensioners at age 65 males 19.8 19.6 Future pensioners at age 65 females 23.6 23.4 The next funding valuation for the UK Scheme is due to be carried out as at 31 March 2006, when the mortality trends under the Scheme will be reviewed and the demographic assumptions updated if appropriate.
D Analysis of assets and expected rates of return The major categories of assets as a percentage of total plan assets are: 2006 2005 % % UK equities 17 26 Overseas equities 30 27 Government bonds 16 31 Corporate bonds Triple B or above 27 13 Other 10 3 100 100 The expected long-term rates of return at 1 April 2006 were: 2006 2005 % % UK equities 8.0 8.1 Overseas equities 8.0 8.4 Government bonds 4.3 4.8 Corporate bonds Triple B or above 4.9 5.5 Other 4.5 3.8 6.2 6.7 Marks and Spencer Group plc 67 11 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued The overall expected return on assets assumption is derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of financial markets as suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
Consideration is also given to the rate of return expected to be available for reinvestment.
As at 1 April 2006 the UK scheme indirectly held 394,672 last year 746,868 ordinary shares in Marks and Spencer Group plc through its investment in an Aquila Life UK Equity Index Fund.

A Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the Scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
Inland Revenue rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three, five or seven years after entering the Scheme.

The resulting fair value is expensed over the five-year service period on the assumption that 30% of options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Company.
Under the plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be offered.
The extent to which the awards vest is based on earnings per share growth over three years.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 41.
The first award under this scheme was made in July 2005.
During the year, 3,694,559 shares were awarded under the plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued was 365.7p.
D Deferred Bonus Plan The Deferred Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005 as part of the annual bonus scheme for approximately 400 of the most senior managers.
As part of the bonus scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which will be held for three years.
There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment, and the value of any dividends earned during the deferred period will be paid at the end of the period.
It is anticipated that shares with a value of 11.9m will be awarded under the scheme in June 2006.
E Restricted Share Plan A Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention of senior employees who are vital to the success of the business recovery and growth.
The Plan operates for senior executives below Executive Director level.
Awards under the plan are made as part of ongoing reviews of reward packages, and recruitment tools for new employees.
The shares are held in trust for a period of between one and three years, at which point they are released to the employee, subject to them still being in employment.
During the year, 564,336 shares last year 795,428 have been awarded under the Restricted Share Plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued was 331.1p last year 332.8p.
F Executive Share Matching Plan The Executive Share Matching Plan for senior management was introduced in 2002, since when there have been annual awards in 2002, 2003 and 2004.
The plan currently operates for four members of senior management, and it is intended that no further awards are made under this plan.
Participants were required to invest one-third of any annual bonus earned in shares of the Company.
The pre-tax value of the invested bonus would be matched by an award of shares, with the extent of the match determined by the Total Shareholder Return performance measure.
No shares have been awarded under the Executive Share Matching Plan during the year.
Last year, 46,293 shares were issued with a weighted average fair value of 376.2p.
G United Kingdom Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan is a discretionary, all-employee plan, approved by the Inland Revenue, under which Freeshares may be allocated by the Company.
The last award was made in July 2003.

The net assets acquired included 1.4m of assets offset by 1.0m of liabilities.
There were no fair value adjustments.
The Group adopted acquisition accounting for the acquisition of the per una group of companies.
Per Una Group Limited was a newly formed entity into which the net assets and liabilities acquired were transferred immediately prior to the acquisition date.
As separate accounts were not maintained for this entity in the period prior to the acquisition date, separate figures for profit after tax were not available.
Based on the available information, the profit before tax attributable to the acquired business in the year to 31 March 2004 and in the six months prior to acquisition was approximately 17m and 15m respectively.
These pre-acquisition figures for the acquired business have been adjusted to reflect the post-acquisition structure for the per una group.
In the six months prior to acquisition, the value of goods purchased from the acquired business was 85.2m.
2 Additions includes 0.8m in respect of discontinued operations.
3 Amortisation charge includes 1.9m in respect of discontinued operations.
Computer software and software under development are internally generated.
Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of three to five years.
Brands consist of the per una brand which was acquired in October 2004 and which is being amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.
Goodwill is not amortised but the Group tests goodwill annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and changes in income and costs.
The Group prepares discounted cash flow forecasts based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a three-year period, which takes account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
Cash flows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.0%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for retail businesses in the UK.
Management estimates the discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to retail businesses.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9.5% has been used.

The net book values included in the tables above include land and buildings of 44.9m last year 50.9m and equipment of 5.0m last year 5.5m where the Group is a lessee under a finance lease.
In accordance with IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IAS 17 Leases the Group reviewed the classification of all leases at the transition balance sheet date of 4 April 2004.
Under IAS 17, the land and building elements of a lease need to be considered separately and the land element is normally deemed to be an operating lease.
As a result, the buildings element of a number of properties, previously treated as operating leases, have been reclassified as finance leases.
In addition, the revaluation element held in respect of leasehold land previously held as a fixed asset has been derecognised and the payments made to acquire such land have been reclassified as leasehold prepayments.
Under the provisions of IFRS 1, the Group adopted a valuation as deemed cost on transition for freehold land and buildings.
A property valuation was prepared on an existing use basis by external valuers DTZ Debenham Tie Leung as at 2 April 2004.
The Group elected under IFRS 1 to reflect this valuation, in so far as it related to freehold land and buildings, as deemed cost on transition at 4 April 2004.
This gave rise to an uplift of 530.9m against the previous carrying value.

The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At 1 April 2006, these amounted to 175m last year 190m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
All committed and uncommitted bank facilities were undrawn as at the balance sheet date.
Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities is as set out below.
There are no financial liabilities other than short term payables excluded from this analysis: 2006 Fixed Floating rate rate Total Currency m m m Sterling 1,137.7 1,045.5 2,183.2 Euro 3.2 0.2 3.4 1,140.9 1,045.7 2,186.6 Included within floating rate liabilities is 54.7m of unredeemed B shares.
The floating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods ranging from one month to six months.
Excluding finance leases, the fixed rate Sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 6.1% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 10.4 years.
Interest rate analysis The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2006 % Medium term notes 5.7 Securitised loan notes 6.3 Non-equity B shares 3.5 Finance leases 4.4 Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: 2006 2005 m m Not later than one year 4.8 5.5 Later than one year but not more than five 9.8 13.6 More than five years 197.7 201.2 212.3 220.3 Future finance charges on finance leases 162.1 166.4 Present value of lease obligations 50.2 53.9 It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is four years and 125 years for property.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
80 Marks and Spencer Group plc Notes to the financial statements continued 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 from the requirement to restate comparatives in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The comparative figures have therefore been measured and presented in accordance with previously adopted UK GAAP.
The main adjustments that would be required to make the comparative information comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 are the inclusion of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the reclassification of non-equity B shares from share capital to debt.
Treasury Policy and Financial Risk Management Marks and Spencer operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups external internal funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and delegated authorities therein given.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Group Treasury also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains Group policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed relate to liquidity funding, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and counterparty risk.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: a Liquidity funding risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium-term note issuance and securitised loan notes.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a Euro Medium Term Note programme of 3 billion, of which 1.7 billion was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
Furthermore, short-term borrowings are backed by a 1.2 billion five-year committed syndicated bank facility, which was undrawn at the balance sheet date.
b Interest rate risk Interest rate risk primarily occurs with the movement of sterling interest rates in relation to the Groups floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Group policy for interest rate management is to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
Interest rate risk in respect of debt on the balance sheet is reviewed on a regular basis against forecast interest costs and covenants.
A number of interest rate swaps have been entered into to redesignate fixed and floating debt.
The structure and maturity of these swaps correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date fixed rate borrowings amounted to 1,137.7m representing the property securitisation, two public bond issues and finance leases.
Based on the financial liabilities and assets as at the balance sheet date a one percentage point movement in average sterling interest rates will have a 6.2m impact on the Groups net interest charge.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, also from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group Treasury hedge these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts covering between 80% and 100% out to 15 months.
As at the balance sheet date the gross value in Sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 270m with a weighted average maturity date of six months.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
Where appropriate, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
Where funding has been sourced in currencies other than sterling, the Group has swapped these exposures back into sterling debt through cross currency swaps matching the underlying terms.
The gross notional value of cross currency swaps as at the balance sheet date was 610.8m with a weighted average maturity of 0.6 years.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 109m.
Marks and Spencer Group plc 81 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued d Counterparty risk Counterparty risk exists where the Group has the potential to experience loss through default or non-performance by financial institutions in relation to outstanding financial instruments.
Counterparty exposures for these instruments are managed through Board approved Group Treasury policy that limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These limits are based on a combination of short-term credit ratings of A-1 P-1 and long-term credit ratings of AAAa3 or better.
The monetary limit will apply to the aggregate of investments and the mark to market value of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
Dealing mandates and derivative agreements are entered into with counterparty banks prior to deals being arranged.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 1 April 2006 was as follows: trade receivables 42m, other receivables 33m, cash and cash equivalents 363m and derivatives 76m.
The Group does not have any material exposures to concentrations of credit risk with any one counterparty.

The attributes of these derivatives match the characteristics of the underlying debt hedged.
Derivatives moving floating debt to fixed have been designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives moving fixed debt to floating have been designated as fair value hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
As at the balance sheet date gross outstanding interest rate swaps amounted to 754.3m with a weighted average maturity of 3.6 years.
The weighted average effective interest rate for floating to fixed interest rate derivatives was 6.3% as at the balance sheet date.
The gross notional outstanding interest rate swaps converting fixed debt to floating was 574.6m with rate fixings being set using the published one, three, or six month LIBOR, where appropriate.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in equity.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables then associated fair value movements previously recognised in equity are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 1 April 2006 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 15 months from the balance sheet date.
With the exception of the Groups fixed rate bond debt, there were no material differences between the carrying value of nonderivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups fixed rate bond debt was 915.0m, the fair value of this debt was 940.8m.

C Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison of fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments by category.
Where market prices are not available for a particular instrument, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and exchange rates.

A property revaluation was prepared on an existing use basis by external valuers DTZ Debenham Tie Leung as at 2 April 2004.
The Group has elected under IFRS 1 to reflect this valuation, in so far as it relates to freehold land and buildings, as deemed cost on transition at 4 April 2004. b IFRS 2 Share Schemes The Group operates a range of share-based incentive schemes.
Under UK GAAP, where shares or rights to shares were awarded to employees, UITF 17 required that the charge to the profit and loss account should be based on the difference between the market value of shares at the date of grant and the exercise price i. e. an intrinsic value basis spread over the performance period.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes were exempt from this requirement and no charge was made.
IFRS 2 requires that all shares or options including SAYE awarded to employees as remuneration should be measured at fair value at grant date, using an option pricing model, and charged against profits over the period between grant date and vesting date, being the vesting period.
This treatment has been applied to all awards granted but not fully vested at the date of transition.
Marks and Spencer Group plc 93 33 ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS continued c IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date Under UK GAAP, dividends are recognised in the period to which they relate.
IAS 10 requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets.
Accordingly the final dividends for 2003 04 160.7m and 2004 05 124.3m are derecognised in the balance sheets for April 2004 and April 2005 respectively.
d IAS 17 Leases Treatment of Leasehold Land The Group previously recognised finance leases under the recognition criteria set out in SSAP 21.
IAS 17 requires the land and building elements of property leases to be considered separately, with leasehold land normally being treated as an operating lease.
As a consequence, payments made to acquire leasehold land, previously treated as fixed assets, have been recategorised as prepaid leases and amortised over the life of the lease.
In addition, the revaluation previously attributed to the land element has been derecognised.
e IAS 17 Leases Finance Leases Also under the provisions of IAS 17, the building elements of certain property leases, classified as operating leases under UK GAAP, have been reclassified as finance leases.
The adjustments are to include the fair value of these leased buildings within fixed assets and to set up the related obligation, net of finance charges, in respect of future periods, within creditors.
f IAS 17 Leases Lease Incentives Under UK GAAP, leasehold incentives received on entering into property leases were recognised as deferred income on the balance sheet and amortised to the profit and loss account over the period to the first rent review.
Under IAS 17, these incentives have to be amortised over the term of the lease.
Consequently, as the term of the lease is longer than the period to the first rent review, amounts previously amortised to the profit and loss account are reinstated on the balance sheet as deferred income and released over the term of the lease.
g IAS 17 Leases Fixed Rental Uplifts The Group has a number of leases that contain predetermined, fixed rental uplifts.
Under IAS 17, it is necessary to account for these leases such that the predetermined, fixed rental payments are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for these property lease rentals such that the increases were charged in the year that they arose.
h IAS 19 Employee Benefits Previously no provision was made for holiday pay.
Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits the expected cost of compensated shortterm absences e. g. holidays should be recognised when employees render the service that increases their entitlement.
As a result, an accrual has been made for holidays earned but not taken.
i IAS 38 Software Assets The cost of developing software used to be written off as incurred.
Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets there is a requirement to capitalise internally generated intangible assets provided certain recognition criteria are met.
Results have been adjusted to reflect the capitalisation and subsequent amortisation of costs that meet the criteria.
As a result expenses previously charged to the profit and loss account have been brought onto the balance sheet as intangible software assets and amortised over their estimated useful lives.
j IAS 38 Goodwill Goodwill used to be capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.
Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets there is a requirement to separately identify brands and other intangibles acquired rather than include these as part of goodwill.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their useful lives.
Goodwill, which is considered to have an indefinite life, is subject to an annual impairment review.
As a result, the goodwill recognised under UK GAAP on the acquisition of per una of 125.5m has been split between brand 80m and goodwill 45.5m.
The goodwill amortisation under UK GAAP has been reversed but the brand has been amortised as required under IFRS.
Cash flow statement The cash flows reported under IFRS relate to movements in cash and cash equivalents defined as short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Under UK GAAP, only the movement in cash defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts were reported in the cash flow statement.
As a result of adopting IFRS, a 55.7m movement in cash equivalents in the year to 2 April 2005 is now reported as a cash flow movement rather than as movement in financial investment.
94 Marks and Spencer Group plc Notes to the financial statements continued 34 FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF IAS 32 AND IAS 39 The adoption of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 3 April 2005 results in a change in the Groups accounting policy for financial instruments.
The impact of these standards on the Groups opening balance sheet is shown below.
The principal impacts of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the Groups financial statements relate to the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value and the reclassification of non-equity B shares as debt.
Any derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are held on the balance sheet at fair value with the changes in value reflected through the income statement.
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting depends on how they are designated, as follows: Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to interest rates of its issued debt.
Under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments were not recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments that meet the fair value hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value movements recognised in the income statement.
For an effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.
To the extent that the designated hedge relationship is fully effective, the amounts in the income statement offset each other.
As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated hedging relationship impacts the financing line in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash flow hedging are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value changes deferred in equity.
In addition, the Group hedges the foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases.
Under UK GAAP, foreign currency derivatives were held off balance sheet and these are now treated as cash flow hedges.
The adjustments to the opening balance sheet as at 3 April 2005 are as follows: Restated Opening Effect of opening balance sheet IAS 32 and position at under IFRS IAS 39 3 Apr 2005 m m m Non-current assets Derivative financial instruments 71.1 71.1 Deferred tax asset 24.6 1.3 25.9 Current assets Derivative financial instruments 2.8 2.8 Inventories 338.9 0.4 339.3 Current liabilities Derivative financial instruments 1.9 1.9 Borrowings 478.8 66.2 545.0 Trade and other payables 717.9 24.7 693.2 Non-current liabilities Derivative financial instruments 12.0 12.0 Borrowings 1,948.5 87.8 2,036.3 Impact on net assets 67.6 Non-equity B shares 65.7 Hedging reserve 1.6 Retained earnings 0.3 Impact on shareholders funds 67.6
