Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
These individual financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom generally accepted accounting standards which have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding period, except for where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards during the current period.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by FRS26, Financial instruments: Measurement FRS26 as detailed below.
The Company has adopted, FRS20, Share-based payment FRS20, FRS21, Events after the balance sheet date FRS21, FRS23, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS23, FRS25, Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation FRS25, FRS26 and FRS28, Corresponding amounts FRS28, in these financial statements.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy.
The adoption of FRS21 has required restatement of the comparative results see notes 13 and 14.
The adoption of FRS26 see notes 10, 13 and 14 has an exemption from restating the comparative results.
Investments All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
The Company adopted FRS26 from 2 October 2005, as a result of which the current asset investments are categorised as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value from that date.
Changes in fair value are taken directly to reserves, and recycled to profit and loss when the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Taxation Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences that result in obligations at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that the asset will be recovered.
Share-based payment share options The Company has no employees.
However it has a number of share option arrangements with the employees of subsidiary companies.
As these arrangements are not with the direct employees of the Company, FRS20 is not applicable to these separate financial statements.
Disclosure of the option arrangements is included in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, which have been prepared under IFRS2 Share-based payment, which FRS20 embodies.
Financial instruments The Company has prospectively adopted the provisions of FRS25 and FRS26 effective from 2 October 2005.
Following the adoption of these Standards, the Company now recognises its financial instruments at fair value on a trade date basis when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The subsequent measurement depends on the classication of the individual financial instruments.
Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale assets are held at fair value with changes in fair value taken to equity.
On disposal of the related asset, the accumulated gains or losses recorded in equity are included in the gain or loss recorded in profit and loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, that is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Prior to the adoption of FRS26, investments in financial assets were held at cost and borrowings were stated at nominal value.

3 The Companys borrowings under the Senior Subordinated Notes the Notes, which pay interest at 10 8%, were subject to legal defeasance during 2005.
On 27 July 2005 the Group irrevocably transferred the remaining 19.9m current value 20.6m of liabilities under the Notes into a trust administered by the Bank of New York the Trustee together with UK Government Gilts and cash sufficient to meet all remaining future liabilities arising on the Notes including an early redemption fee payable in April 2007.
In certain circumstances, it is possible for the assets and liabilities of the trust to be returned to the Company.
