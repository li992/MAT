Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly the Groups tax charge will continue to depend on the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of 124 million 2005: 130 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.

These amounts will be written off to the Income Statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of Exploration and Evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 65 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 10.
The carrying amount of the Groups oil and gas assets includes an amount of 10,381,000 2005: 14,184,000 in respect of assets held under finance leases.
Other fixed assets include leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, generally on a field-byfield basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Bank loans, overdrafts and guarantees are secured by fixed and floating charges over the producing assets of the Group.
Wherever possible the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US Dollars all other countries, the functional currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
Balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating or administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
At 31 December 2006 the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were $280 million 142.9 million cash drawings under the US$850 million Borrowing Base Facility, a $7.5 million 3.8 million Revolving Loan taken out in Ireland and funds in Pakistan of 389.2 million Pakistani Rupees 3.3 million in respect of sales income held awaiting the necessary approval for repatriation.
The US$280 million drawn under the Borrowing Base Facility at 31 December 2006 continues to be held as a hedge against US$ denominated net assets in subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2006 was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 Cash at bank at floating interest rate 38,256 130 53,763 6,619 98,768 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 133 577 710 Fixed rate debt 30,000 63,805 93,805 Floating rate debt 40,000 87,768 127,768 Net debt cash 31,611 130 97,233 6,619 122,095 The profile at 31 December 2005 for comparison purposes was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 Cash at bank at floating interest rate 36,102 20,228 359 56,689 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 194 50 5,330 3,123 8,697 Fixed rate debt 42,500 34,286 76,786 Floating rate debt 51,516 77,289 128,805 Net debt cash 57,720 50 86,017 3,482 140,205 Cash at bank at floating interest rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 69 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 16.
Financial liabilities continued The Borrowing Base Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 240 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets and US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 240 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 August 2012, or such other time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Borrowing Base Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Borrowing Base Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility from time to time, net of relevant cash balances.
In the table for 2006, 93.8 million of the gross debt has been shown as fixed rate debt as the particular bank borrowings were fixed in November 2006 for a six month duration.
In December 2005, the Group executed an interest rate hedging programme effective February 2006, whereby 50% of the projected interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR was hedged through the application of a series of interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars.
The effect of these derivatives limits the interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR at 5.7% and US Dollar LIBOR at 5.8%.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars were put in place for a three year period for US Dollar expiring November 2008 and for an 18 month period for Sterling LIBOR expiring May 2007 at varying notional principal amounts.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values.
Therefore the hedged amounts are included in Floating Rate Debt in the 2006 table.
Derivative financial instruments The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.
The Groups policy is to mitigate its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations for a portion of its production, using a range of derivative financial instruments such as fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero cost collars and other option structures.
The Groups policy is also to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates through the use of similar derivative financial instruments.
Fair values of derivative instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet with changes in such fair value between accounting periods being recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
The fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices marked-to-market values where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The fair value of derivative instruments are recorded on the Balance Sheet under the caption Derivative Financial Instruments under Current Assets Liabilities and Non-Current Liabilities.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: 31 Dec 31 Dec 2006 2005 Assets Liabilities : 000 000 Derivative Instruments Gas derivatives 45,614 31,520 Oil derivatives 72,682 116,344 Interest rate derivatives 156 17 Exchange rate derivatives 5,889 21,023 147,847 Analysed as follows: Amounts falling due within one year 16,065 70,639 Amounts falling due after one year 37,088 77,208 21,023 147,847 A large portion of the oil derivative liabilities at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006 relate to contracts acquired as part of the acquisition of Energy Africa in May 2004: these contracts cover 4,000 bopd at a maximum Brent Dated price for the Group of $29.30 barrel, extending to 31 December 2009.
These derivative liabilities are substantially offset by an increase in the economic value of the underlying hedged future oil production.
70 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Cash flow hedges As at 31 December 2006 all of the Groups commodity and interest rate derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
As a result, the effective portion of hedging gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of designated hedging instruments is deferred in a separate component of reserves, subject to the establishment of a highly effective correlation defined in IAS 39 as hedge effectiveness within a range of 80 125% between the commodity hedge and the underlying physical commoditys pricing and sale characteristics.
Such effective gains or losses, which are deferred to reserves, are recorded on the Balance Sheet under the caption Hedge Reserve see note 22.
Similar hedge effectiveness testing is carried out in relation to the Groups interest rate derivatives.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the Income Statement in the period, and such hedge ineffectiveness for the oil and gas commodity hedges is described below.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in the Income Statement under the caption Gain Loss on Hedging Instruments with any associated tax effect being recorded under the caption Income Tax Expense.
Hedge ineffectiveness arises when the hedge correlation results are within the range of 80 125% but not 100% precisely.
Any change in the time value component of the hedge instrument is also recognised immediately in the Income Statement under the caption Gain Loss on Hedging Instruments.
Any associated tax effect is recorded under the caption Income Tax Expense.
Oil hedges The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil revenues.
These derivative instruments include fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero cost collars and other option structures.
Such oil derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil revenues.
The Group hedges its estimated oil revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its revenues from substantially all of its West African oil interests.
At 31 December 2006 the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil hedges H1 2007 H2 2007 2008 2009 2010 Volume bopd 15,400 15,400 9,300 4,500 Average price $ bbl 53.78 56.04 50.58 33.37 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2006 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.
As at 31 December 2006 all of the Groups oil derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using a regression analysis.
There is however a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying West African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
As at 31 December 2006 an unrealised loss of 73.9 million has been deferred to the Hedge Reserve, net of tax effects.
Changes in fair value of oil hedges which have been recognised in the Income Statement in the current period amount to a gain of 10.2 million, with an associated tax charge of 0.9 million.
A proportion of the oil cash flow hedges do not generate an offsetting tax charge or credit.
Gas Hedges The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying UK gas revenues.
Such gas derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks which correlate as far as possible to the underlying gas revenues.
The Group hedges its estimated UK gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2006 the Groups gas hedge position was summarised as follows: Gas hedges H1 2007 H2 2007 2008 2009 2010 Volume mmscfd 77.8 56.4 41.6 3.6 Average price p therm 49.35 44.73 45.73 50.43 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2006 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.
As at 31 December 2006, all of the Groups gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using ratio analysis.
There is, however, a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges arising from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.
As at 31 December 2006, an unrealised gain of 21.6 million has been deferred to the Hedge Reserve, net of tax effects.
Changes in fair value of gas hedges which have been recognised in the Income Statement in the current period amount to a loss of 0.4 million, with an associated tax credit of 0.2 million.
Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 71 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 17.
Derivative financial instruments continued Foreign Exchange Hedges The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate its exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates.
As at 31 December 2006 none of the Groups foreign exchange derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
Consequently the changes in fair value of the instruments have been recognised immediately in the Income Statement and amount to a gain of 5.9 million, with an associated tax charge of 1.8 million.
Income statement hedge summary The changes in the fair value of hedges which require to be recognised immediately in the Income Statement for the year, together with associated tax effects, were as follows: 2006 2005 Gain loss on hedging instruments: 000 000 Gas derivatives net 387 2,407 Oil derivatives net 10,199 2,566 Foreign exchange derivatives net 5,889 Total net gain loss for the year in Income Statement 15,701 159 2006 2005 Income tax credit charge : 000 000 Gas derivatives net 194 963 Oil derivatives net 873 729 Foreign exchange derivatives net 1,767 Total net charge for the year in income statement 2,446 1,692 Deferred amounts in hedge reserve The following table summarises the deferred gains losses on derivative instruments, net of tax effects, recorded in Hedge Reserve note 22 for the year: 2006 2005 000 000 At 1 January 120,449 Amounts recognised in profit for the year 13,255 1,851 Deferred gains losses before tax arising during the year 122,625 130,494 Deferred tax movement taken directly to equity 41,134 8,194 68,236 120,449 At 31 December 52,213 120,449 Note 18.

These provisions have been created based on Tullows internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Acquisition of subsidiaries On 25 September 2006 the Group announced a proposal to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Hardman Resources Limited by way of a Scheme of Arrangement.
Following the approval of the acquisition by Hardman shareholders and the Australian Courts, the Scheme became effective on 20 December 2006 and formal completion, which involved the payment of AS$819.5 million and the issue of 65 million Tullow shares, occurred on 10 January 2007.
The acquisition of Hardman provides additions to the Groups production, development and exploration activities in Africa and adds exploration acreage in Europe and South America.
The transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 20 December 2006, being the date that Tullow gained control of Hardman.
For reasons of materiality and practicality, Tullow has consolidated Hardmans results from 31 December 2006.
The fair value allocation to the Hardman assets is preliminary in nature and will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Due to the inherently uncertain nature of the oil and gas industry and intangible exploration evaluation assets in particular, the assumptions underlying the preliminary assigned values are highly judgemental in nature.

Options awarded under the 2000 ESOS before 24 May 2005 are subject to monthly re-testing on a rolling three year basis if the TSR performance criterion is not met.
Options granted on or after 24 May 2005 are not subject to monthly re-testing.

UK and Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs The SIPs were launched at the beginning of 2004.
These are all-employee plans, which have been set up in both the UK and Ireland that enable employees to make contributions out of salary up to prescribed limits each month, which are used by the Plan trustees to acquire Tullow shares Partnership Shares.
The Company makes a matching contribution to the trustees to acquire a matching number of Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
The SIPs have a three month accumulation period.
The fair value of a Matching Share is the market value at grant adjusted for any options included.
For this purpose, the grant date is the start of the accumulation period.
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and the purchase date.
For the Irish Plan, shares are bought at the market price at the purchase date.
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period.
The Company recognised a total expense of 55,000 2005: 31,000 for the matching shares and 7,000 2005: 4,000 for the partnership shares.
