Directors Responsibilities The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the financial year and of the pro t or loss of the Group for the financial year.
The Directors consider that in preparing the Financial Statements on pages 32 to 75 the Group has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Group keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Group and which enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Companys website.
Information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
