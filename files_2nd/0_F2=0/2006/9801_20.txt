In relation to the limited graphical disclosures for 2002 and 2003 these are the only adjustments that have been made to past disclosures made under UK GAAP.
In terms of the transitional adjustments required for conversion to IFRS, these are the only material adjustments considered by the Directors to be necessary to produce a five year record that discloses the results of continuing operations on a consistent, like for like, basis.
