NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 1 General information N Brown Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is listed at the end of the report.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out on page 18 of the directors report.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 36.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
N Brown Group plcs consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP until 26th February 2005.
UK GAAP differs in some areas from IFRS.
In preparing this financial information, management has amended certain accounting and valuation methods applied in the UK GAAP financial statements to comply with the recognition and measurement criteria of IFRS.
The comparative figures in respect of 2005 were restated to reflect these adjustments.
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and are therefore subject to change.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Accounting period Throughout the accounts and the directors report and financial review, reference to 2006 means at 25 February 2006 or the 52 weeks then ended: reference to 2005 means at 26 February 2005 or the 52 weeks then ended.
Transitional arrangements IFRS 1 The rules for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In general a company is required to define its IFRS accounting policies and apply these retrospectively to determine its opening balance sheet under IFRS.
The standard allows a number of optional exemptions to this general principle to assist companies as they make the transition to reporting under IFRS.
The group has made the following elections under the IFRS 1 provisions for optional exemptions: 1.
The group has elected not to account under IFRS 3 for business combinations made prior to 28 February 2004.
The group has elected not to measure items of property, plant and equipment at fair value at the date of transition to IFRS but will use UK GAAP net book values at that date.
The group has elected to recognise in full all actuarial gains and losses related to liabilities under any employee benefit arrangement IAS 19 in opening equity under IFRS.
In future, actuarial gains and losses will be recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The group will only apply the provisions of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments to equity instruments issued after 7 November 2002.
The group will take up the exemption related to financial instruments IAS 32 and IAS 39 that allows it not to present comparative information in compliance with those standards but will continue to comply with UK GAAP in this respect for instruments in place during the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005.
The group will comply fully with IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 26 February 2005.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries made up to the Saturday that falls closest to 28 February each year.
The Employee Share Ownership Trust and the No 2 Employee Share Ownership Trust the employee trusts, are also made up to a date co-terminus with the financial period of the parent company.
N Brown Group plc Report and Accounts 2006 41 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 2 Accounting policies continued The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of jointly controlled entities are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses represents any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 March 1998 was charged against reserves in the year of acquisition in accordance with UK GAAP and has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the total amount receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of returns, VAT and sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the applicable effective interest rate which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial assets to that assets net carrying amount.
Income from other services is recognised when the services have been performed.
Property, plant & equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values, based on current prices at the balance sheet date, over their remaining useful lives, using the straight-line method.
No depreciation is charged on freehold land.
In this respect the following annual depreciation rates apply: Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold property and improvements over the period of the lease Motor vehicles 20% Computer equipment 20% Plant and machinery between 5% and 20% Fixtures and fittings between 10% and 20% Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
42 N Brown Group plc Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 2 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Computer software development costs that generate economic benefits beyond one year are capitalised as an intangible assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over five years.
Customer databases and brand names arising on acquisitions re-assessed under the transitional requirements of IFRS 3 are amortised over the useful economic lives, which have been assessed as five years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimate of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Assets held under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets at a value equal to the original costs incurred by the lessor less depreciation, and obligations to the lessor are shown as part of creditors.
The interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Inventories Inventories have been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value means estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
N Brown Group plc Report and Accounts 2006 43 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 2 Accounting policies continued In preparing the financial statement of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into forward contracts and options see below for details of the groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Profits and losses on financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase of overseas sourced product, and interest rates relating to the groups debt.
The group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivatives are stated at their fair value.
The fair value of foreign currency derivatives contracts is their quoted market value at the balance sheet date.
Market values are based on the duration of the derivative instrument together with the quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate contracts is the estimated amount that the group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into account prevailing interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
44 N Brown Group plc Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 2 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 27 February 2005.
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale if highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the year end date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Trade receivables An appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable trade receivables is derived where there is an identified event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a potential reduction in the recoverability of future cash flows.
This estimation is based on assumed collection rates which, although based on the groups historic experience of customer repayment patterns, remains inherently uncertain.
Inventory Provision is made for those items of inventory where the net realisable value is estimated to be lower than cost.
Net realisable value is based on both historic experience and assumptions regarding future selling values, and is consequently a source of estimation uncertainty.

62 N Brown Group plc Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 33 Equity settled share based payments continued The fair value of management and sharesave options awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The group recognised total expenses of 0.6m and 0.7m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2006 and 2005 respectively.
N Brown Group plc Report and Accounts 2006 63 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 34 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contributions scheme The group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 0.5m 2005, 0.3m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 25 February 2006, contributions of 0.1m 2005, 0.1m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 30 June 2003 by an independent qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the groups net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2006 2005 Discount rate 4.7 5.2 Expected return on scheme assets 5.6 5.9 Expected rate of salary increase 4.4 4.4 Pension increase rate for post 1997 pensions 2.9 2.9 Pension increase rate for pre 1997 pensions 2.0 2.0 2006 2005 Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: m m Current service cost 2.1 2.1 Interest cost 2.8 2.5 Expected return on scheme assets 1.4 1.3 Past service cost 3.5 3.3 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The actual return on scheme assets was 4.4m 2005, 2.0m.
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost would be expected to increase.

Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes Model.
Business combinations IFRS 3 The basis of accounting for pre-transition combinations under UK GAAP has not been revisited.
The initial carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired in such business combinations is deemed to be equivalent to cost.
Intangible assets IAS 38 a Intangible assets also comprise a brand name and customer database arising on acquisition during the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005, which has been re-assessed under the transitional guidelines of IFRS 3. b Computer software development costs that generate economic benefits beyond one year are now recognised separately as an intangible fixed asset.
These were previously classified as property, plant and equipment under UK GAAP.
c Employee benefits IAS 19 IAS 19 requires that pension scheme charges be recognised separately in the income statement with current service costs charged to operating profit and net financing costs charged to interest costs.
The group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Pension scheme deficits are recognised in the group balance sheet, 2005, 28.3m, 2004, 24.0m gross of the related deferred tax asset, 2005, 8.6m 2004, 7.3m.
IAS 19 also requires holiday pay to be accrued for when the corresponding services have been received from employees, 2005, 0.4m 2004, 0.4m.
d Catalogue costs IAS 38 Catalogue costs under IFRS are expensed as incurred.
Under UK GAAP these costs were spread over the life of a catalogue in order to match against revenue, 2005, 6.4m, 2004, 2.6m.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised on these adjustments of 2005, 1.9m, 2004, 0.8m.
e Non-current assets held for sale IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale are presented separately from other non-current assets under IFRS.
In 2005 this amount includes 16.0m transferred from trade receivables, 7.0m transferred from property, plant and equipment, 0.1m from inventories and 0.6m from trade and other payables.
f Dividends IAS 10 Dividends proposed will be disclosed as a Non-adjusting Event after the Balance Sheet Date under IAS 10.
Under IFRS dividends are not recognised as liabilities IAS 37 until they are appropriately approved and are no longer at the discretion of the directors.
Accordingly proposed dividends under UK GAAP have been removed from the IFRS accounts, 2005, 12.1m, 2004, 12.0m.
g Financial instruments IAS 32 and 39 The group adopted IAS 32 and 39 on 27 February 2005 as permitted under the exemptions of IFRS 1.
The impact was limited to the recognition of fair value movements in forward contracts and embedded derivatives on the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A deferred tax asset of 0.3m is included in 2005.
h Cumulative translation difference Under IFRS, exchange rate differences arising on consolidation on the translation of overseas subsidiaries are required to be recognised as a separate equity reserve.
I The cash flow differences between UK GAAP and IFRS are either movements within a classification adjustments netting to zero or presentational.
There is no impact on the final cash position nor the movement during the periods presented.
