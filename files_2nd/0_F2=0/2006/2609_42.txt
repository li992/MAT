NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25 Acquisition of subsidiary continued Details of the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows: Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Net assets acquired Property, plant and equipment 0.6 0.6 Stock 1.6 0.1 1.5 Trade and other receivables 0.1 0.1 Trade and other payables 0.2 0.2 2.3 0.3 2.0 Goodwill 3.9 Total consideration 5.9 Satisfied by cash 3.7 deferred consideration within one year 1.5 commission paid in January 2006 0.3 direct costs relating to the acquisition 0.4 5.9 The acquired business contributed turnover of 10.9m and attributable profit of 0.6m to the Group for the period from 1 August 2005 to 31 March 2006.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 April 2005, it is estimated that the impact on the Group turnover for the full year would have been 16.3m and attributable profit would have been 0.9m.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition because of anticipated synergies that do not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
26 Derivative financial instruments The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 April 2005 and the impact of this is shown in note 3 Changes in accounting polices and presentation.
As a result of adopting these standards on 1 April 2005 no comparatives are shown.
The Group income statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward exchange contracts.
These can be analysed into two categories.
Cash flow hedges Burberry Groups principal foreign currency denominated transactions arise from royalty income and the sale and purchase of overseas sourced products.
In the UK, the Group manages these exposures by the use of Yen and Euro forward exchange contracts for a period of 12 months in advance.
In addition, the Groups overseas subsidiaries hedge the foreign currency element of their product purchases on a seasonal basis.
This hedging activity involves the use of spot and forward currency instruments.
Fair value hedges Certain intercompany loan balances are hedged using forward exchange contracts to offset any volatility in foreign currency movements and tax arising thereon.
The balances are hedged up to the date of repayment.
