MINING AND TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS Alumina Aluminium oxide.
It is extracted from bauxite in a chemical refining process and is subsequently the principal raw material in the electro-chemical process by which aluminium is produced.
Anode and cathode copper At the final stage of the smelting of copper concentrates, the copper is cast into specially shaped slabs called anodes for subsequent refining to produce refined cathode copper.
Bauxite Mainly hydrated aluminium oxides Al O.
Principal ore of alumina, the raw material from which 2 3 2 aluminium is made.
Beneficiated bauxite Bauxite ore that has been treated to remove waste material to improve its physical or chemical characteristics.
Bioleaching The deliberate use of bacteria to speed the chemical release of metals from ores.
Block caving An underground bulk mining method.
It involves undercutting the orebody to induce ore fracture and collapse by gravity.
The broken ore is recovered through draw points below.
Borates A generic term for mineral compounds which contain boron and oxygen.
Cathode copper Refined copper produced by electrolytic refining of impure copper or by electro-winning.
Classification Separating crushed and ground ore into portions of different size particles.
Coking coal By virtue of its carbonisation properties, it is used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel making process.
Also known as metallurgical coal.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration process, such as flotation or gravity concentration, which involves separating ore minerals from unwanted waste rock.
Concentrates require subsequent processing such as smelting or leaching to break down or dissolve the ore minerals and obtain the desired elements, usually metals.
Cutoff grade The lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic to process.
It is used in the calculation of the quantity of ore present in a given deposit.
Dor A precious metal alloy which is produced by smelting.
Dor is an intermediate product which is subsequently refined to produce pure gold and silver.
DWT Dead weight tons is the combined weight in long tons 2,240 pounds weight of cargo, fuel and fresh water that a ship can carry.

In the flotation process certain mineral particles are induced to float by becoming attached to bubbles of froth whereas others, usually unwanted, sink.
Grade The proportion of metal or mineral present in ore, or any other host material, expressed in this document as per cent, grammes per tonne or ounces per ton.
Head grade The average grade of ore delivered to the mill.
Ilmenite Mineral composed of iron, titanium and oxygen.
Metallurgical coal By virtue of its carbonisation properties, it is used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel making process.
Also known as coking coal.
Mineral resource A concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earths crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
Mineral resources are sub-divided in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
Ore A rock from which a metal s or mineral s can be economically and legally extracted.
Ore milled The quantity of ore processed.
Ore hoisted The quantity of ore which is removed from an underground mine for processing.
Ore reserve The economically mineable part of a Measured and or Indicated Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the materials are mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.
Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves.
Pressure oxidation A method of treating sulphide ores.
In the case of refractory gold ores, the object is to oxidise the sulphides to sulphates and hence liberate the gold for subsequent cyanide leaching.
The technique involves reaction of the ore with sulphuric acid under pressure in the presence of oxygen gas.
Rock mined The quantity of ore and waste rock excavated from the mine.
In this document, the term is only applied to surface mining operations.
Rutile A mineral composed of titanium and oxygen TiO.
2 Steam coal Also referred to as steaming coal, thermal coal or energy coal.
It is used as a fuel source in electrical power generation, cement manufacture and various industrial applications.
Stripping ratio The tonnes of waste material which must be removed to allow the mining of one tonne of ore. Solvent extraction Processes for extracting metal from an ore and producing pure metal.
First the metal is leached into and electrowinning SX-EW solution: the resulting solution is then purified in the solvent extraction process: the solution is then treated in an electro-chemical process electro-winning to recover cathode copper.
Tailings The rock wastes which are rejected from a concentrating process after the recoverable valuable minerals have been extracted.
Titanium dioxide feedstock A feedstock rich in titanium dioxide, produced, in Rio Tintos case, by smelting ores containing titanium minerals.

The expansion follows the completion of the cyclone-proof tug harbour at Cape Lambert in 2006 the significance of which was underlined by an unprecedented succession of tropical cyclones that battered the coast over the wet season.
The port, unlike Parker Point and East Intercourse Island at Dampier, is more exposed to the open ocean.
Combined, the ports should ensure shipments continue apace with rapidly expanding mining operations.
The expansion of Cape Lambert is the final infrastructure work required to achieve a sustainable 220 million tonnes annual port capacity.

Until now, the effectiveness of Rio Tintos procurement process, the foundations for which were laid a decade ago, has shielded the Groups operations from the worst effects of current shortages and cost increases.
Today, however, with industry wide mine production expanding as fast as it can to meet increased demand, the competition for scarce resources in every sector of the industry is becoming more fierce.
The boom has caused a market shortage of basic mining inputs such as tyres and explosives.
There are shortages, too, of cement, ore cars and steel, and in addition longer lead times are required to get large mining equipment and spares.
Orders for new heavy mobile equipment have doubled since 2000, despite prices escalating rapidly.
The market for off road tyres is extremely tight and no capacity has been added to the industry for more than three years.
Yet Rio Tinto has maintained production in spite of tyre and other shortages.
The Group is in a strong position for tyres and will have enough to meet forecast needs.
This is due to good supplier relationships built up over the years and the Groups successful Improving performance together programme.
In 1998 the Group moved from purchasing by individual business units towards a combined approach that leveraged spending and volume to secure favourable terms for large Group contracts.
In 2001 a new phase began with the deployment of electronic technologies.
Today there is a fully integrated global procurement function that provides Rio Tinto with a competitive advantage at a time of rising prices.
Trade with China is becoming a two way street.
China is not just a customer, it is also becoming a key supplier.
Rio Tinto is sourcing an increasing volume of fabricated and manufactured products and raw materials from China, including rail cars and tugboats for Rio Tinto Iron Ores ports and transport system.

At the same time, the industry faces social and political pressures to use less energy and water and to leave a smaller environmental footprint both during and after mining not just in established locations but in newer territories too.
These trends suggest new approaches to mining in the future.
The large scale surface operations of the past will need to give way to underground techniques, such as block caving, that use less energy and create less disturbance at ground level.
New hydro-metallurgical techniques may make it possible to extract minerals from the ore in situ without bringing huge amounts of rock to the surface again saving energy.
And given that most mining takes place in remote parts of the world, where its hard to recruit or locate the necessary staff expertise, tomorrows mines may need to rely more on remote monitoring and control possibly even from thousands of kilometres away.
In all these areas it is important that Rio Tinto enhances its skills and develops new ones, in order to remain competitive in the decades ahead.
In the face of these challenges, OTX itself is likely to change in the coming years.
While continuing to employ the best engineers and scientists, it will also need business analysts and change management professionals, who can work with Rio Tintos business units to turn engineering and scientific solutions into better financial performance.
It also needs to ensure that the radical, longer term changes required in the next quarter century receive proper attention alongside the opportunities for improvement in the near term.
However OTX develops, adds Grant Thorne, its work will be characterised by the same clear principles the disciplined setting of measures, monitoring the changes to Rio Tintos performance and translating those changes into real, bottom line value.
From the simple to the complex, the way Rio Tinto applies and develops new technology is vital to its future success.

Another area where we hold a major competitive advantage is in brownfield exploration.
Local geological knowledge accumulated over many years of work allows us to identify new resources in exploration environments as mature as the Hamersley Basin in Western Australia.
Such resources are highly valuable given their proximity to existing mines.
Exploration has an excellent track record and is credited with ten major discoveries over the past 15 years, most of which are now operating mines or projects that are undergoing evaluation within product groups.
A rich portfolio of current opportunities suggests that this performance will continue.

Under EU IFRS, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Groups UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated.

It reverses part of an exceptional charge taken up in 2002, which was excluded from Adjusted earnings at that time.
This reversal is therefore excluded in arriving at Underlying earnings.
The Group frequently sells undeveloped properties as an alternative to development, and such activities are a component of the Groups regular business activities.
