Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Key assumptions and significant judgements IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that are considered to be significant are: Impairment of goodwill - Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill allocated to the Groups primary segments are calculated by estimating long-term growth rates and discount rates, based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of future prospects.
Full details of these estimates are provided in note 11 to the financial statements.
Pension liabilities - The present value of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is determined by qualified actuaries, using a number of assumptions.
The principal assumptions adopted are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Residual values - Residual values are reassessed annually based on prevailing market prices, and adjusted if appropriate.
