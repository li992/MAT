Financial Statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 29 Share-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2006, the Group had a number of share-based compensation plans: i All-Employee Share Option Plans Local All-Employee Share Option Plans have been set up in 15 countries to enhance employee involvement with Unilever and its performance by providing a potential financial benefit linked to the Unilever share price.
There are no individual performance targets to be met.
The plans permit participation by all permanent employees in the country where the relevant plan applies.
ii Executive Option Plans The Executive Option Plans were introduced in 1985 to reward key employees throughout the world for their contribution to the enhancement of the Groups longer-term future and their commitment to the Group over a sustained period.
The grants were dependent on performance of the Group and the individual.
iii Global Performance Share Plan GPSP Introduced in 2005, under this plan managers can be awarded conditional shares which will vest three years later at a level between 0% and 150% - 200% depending on Unilevers achievement of set targets for Underlying Sales Growth and Ungeared Free Cash Flow over the three-year performance period.
iv TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and, depending on the TSR ranking see page 27 of Unilever in comparison with its peer group, it will potentially award top executives on the vesting date three years later with between 0% and 200% of the original conditional award.
v North America Performance Share Programme A long-term incentive plan for North American managers, awarding Unilever shares if company targets are met over a three-year period.
vi Other plans These comprise a Share Matching Plan, a Restricted Share Plan, and a cash-settled share-based retention plan.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of Executive Option Plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all Plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
In recent years we have met the obligations under our share option and award plans by purchasing shares in advance and transferring them, in return for the exercise price, to Directors and employees as the options are exercised or the awards vest.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 49 to 62 and those for key management personnel shown in note 31 on page 122.
No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2004, 2005 and 2006 under the North America Performance Share Programme, the Restricted Share Plan or the cash-settled share-based retention plan.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model usually an adjusted Black-Scholes or multinomial model and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
The actual remuneration costs charged in each period is shown below, and relates almost wholly to equity settled plans: million million million 2006 2005 2004 All-Employee Share Option Plans 12 13 17 Executive Option Plans 29 63 105 Global Performance Share Plan 17 15 TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan 9 10 9 North America Performance Share Programme 31 63 64 Other Plans 22 28 23 120 192 218 Disclosures, including a description of the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of options and the weighted average information, are given below for each type of plan, on a combined basis.
In the tables for each plan or group of plans, option or award valuations are given on the basis of the weighted average of options or awards granted during each period.
For plans involving options, the fair value per option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing method.
The expected option terms are based on historic data.
Figures for expected volatility are set with regard to historic volatility over the last six years.
The expected dividend yield is based on the dividend yield in the year of grant.
Forfeiture rates are set annually with regard to historic forfeiture rates.

These options become exercisable after a three-year period from the date of grant.
The options have a maximum term of ten years.

Additional information As a result of the share-based compensation plans for employees, we are exposed to movements in our own share price.
We take a exible approach to the buying of shares to meet these obligations, not automatically buying shares at grant.
In 2001, we entered into a contract with a bank for the forward purchase of Unilever shares.
This contract was terminated in March 2006.
At 31 December 2006, there were options outstanding to purchase 87 114 773 2005: 99 687 447 ordinary shares in NV or PLC in respect of share-based compensation plans of NV and its subsidiaries and the North American plans, and 28 832 519 2005: 33 703 439 ordinary shares in NV or PLC in respect of share-based compensation plans of PLC and its subsidiaries.
To satisfy the options granted, certain NV group companies hold 91 935 752 2005: 99 695 763 ordinary shares of NV or PLC, and trusts in Jersey and the United Kingdom hold 16 678 871 2005: 19 454 453 PLC shares.
The trustees of these trusts have agreed, until further notice, 1 to waive dividends on these shares, save for the nominal sum of 0.01p per 3 9p ordinary share.
Shares acquired during 2006 represent 0.2% of the Groups called up capital.
The book value of 1 836 million 2005: 2 258 million of all shares held in respect of share-based compensation plans for both NV and PLC is eliminated on consolidation by deduction from other reserves see note 23 on page 110.
Their market value at 31 December 2006 was 2 279 million 2005: 2 261 million.
At 31 December 2006 the exercise price of 14 989 001 2005: 43 740 558 NV and PLC options were above the market price of the shares.
Shares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 and SIC12.
All differences between the purchase price of the shares held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves.
In 2006 this includes 7 million 2005: 7 million for shares held to meet options expiring in the short term which are priced above market value.
The basis of the charge to operating profit for the economic value of options granted is discussed on page 117.
Obligations over the following number of shares were granted, exercised, forfeited or expired between 31 December 2006 and 1 March 2007.
In this period we have also, in line with prior years practice, purchased 206 871 NV New York Registry Shares and 259 522 PLC shares in the form of ADRs to satisfy awards under the North America Executive Option and Share Matching Plans.
