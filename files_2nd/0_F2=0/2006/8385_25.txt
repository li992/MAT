Of which 12 million 2005: 9 million is recorded within cost of sales, 1 million 2005: nil is included within distribution costs and 1 million 2005: 4 million is included within administrative costs.
Total research and development expenditure incurred after adding back amounts capitalised as intangible assets is 110 million 2005: 124 million.
64 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 5 Auditors remuneration total Group Fees in respect of the audit during the year ended 31 March 2006 were 4 million 2005: 5 million.
Fees paid in respect of other services provided by Ernst & Young LLP were: to UK Group companies 1 million 2005: 2 million and non-UK Group companies 1 million 2005: 3 million.
Fees paid in respect of these other services are analysed as follows: 2006 2005 m m Taxation advisory services 12 Other local statutory reporting and other audit-related services 1 2 IFRS audit and advisory services 1 25 6 Staff numbers and employee benefits expense total Group The average number of people employed by the Group including directors during the year was as follows: 2006 2005 Marketing and distribution 3,692 4,278 Production 23,177 27,259 Technical 1,850 2,210 Finance and administration 2,150 2,618 30,869 36,365 The aggregate payroll costs of these people were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Wages and salaries 703 769 Social security costs 86 95 Pension and post-retirement costs note 25 45 49 Share-based payment expense note 29 83 Other payroll costs 38 37 880 953 7 Foreign exchange gains and losses Foreign exchange losses in the year of 33 million 2005: 16 million gain relate to exchange differences arising on the translation of unhedged foreign currency monetary items used in the financing of the Group and its subsidiaries.
These are principally attributable to exchange differences on the Groups non-sterling denominated currency borrowings, held in companies whose functional currency is sterling.
Of the exchange losses, 23 million arose on dollar borrowings.
The Groups hedging policy is determined by reference to the currency of the underlying cash generation, ensuring as far as possible an economic hedge.
This results in an unhedged position under IAS 21.

The basic loss earnings per share for the year has been calculated using 5,687 million shares 2005: 5,687 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, and the loss profit after taxation and minority interests for continuing operations, discontinued operations and total Group as shown above.
Earnings per share for continuing operations is also calculated by reference to earnings before exceptional items and foreign exchange gains and losses with an underlying tax charge of 26 million 2005: 22 million, since the directors consider that this gives a useful additional indication of underlying performance.
The diluted loss earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share without reference to adjustments in respect of certain share options which are considered to be anti-dilutive.
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements other than that described in note 35.

An analysis of the carrying amount of goodwill by primary business segment is set out below.
Certain of the business segments comprise a number of CGUs.
2006 2005 m m Controls 38 47 Process Systems 65 59 Rail Systems 11 APV 77 Eurotherm 111 107 Continuing operations 222 221 Discontinued operations 89 222 310 70 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 Annual impairment test The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections over a five-year period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: revenue volumes: revenue prices: operating costs: growth rate assumptions for years 4 and 5 of the cash flow projections: growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value: and discount rate.
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are based on past experience and expected future developments in markets and operations and are the same assumptions used in the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management.
These projections cover the first three years of the cash flow projections.
Cash flows for years 4 and 5 are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
These growth rates take into consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the levels of growth achieved historically by the CGU and forecast in the periods covered by the budget and strategic plan.
Lower growth rates are applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal value for each CGU.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The discount rate applied to each CGU is a pre-tax rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect managements estimate of the specific risk profile associated with the cash flow projections for the CGU.
These discount rates and growth rates by CGU are as follows: 2006 2006 2005 2005 Discount Growth Discount Growth rate rate rate rate %%%% Controls Appliance and Climate Controls 12.69 3.10 12.47 2.70 IMServ 13.69 1.90 13.46 1.60 Invensys Building Systems 12.69 3.10 12.47 2.70 Process Systems IPS Sales, Operations, Customer Services and IPS Products 15.61 3.50 15.35 3.00 IPS Solutions and Services 15.61 3.10 15.35 2.70 Wonderware 15.61 3.20 15.35 2.70 Rail Systems 16.71 2.60 16.43 2.20 APV 16.95 2.70 16.67 2.30 Eurotherm 16.18 3.00 15.91 2.60 In perpetuity.
In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year 2005: 28 million.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With respect to the assessment of value in use of all CGUs management believes that, with the exception of IMServ, no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.
With respect to IMServ, a reasonable possible change in the discount rate would cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 29 million 2005: 25 million that will expire within four years.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of 520 million 2005: 517 million in respect of pension and other retirement benefit obligations.
The Group has unrecognised capital losses of 2,267 million 2005: 2,234 million that are only available for offset against future capital gains.
Included in capital losses are losses of 1,765 million 2005: 1,695 million that will expire within four years.
Other capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 850 million 2005: 1,203 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

There are no joint ventures.
Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets consist of investments in listed ordinary shares and therefore have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss The investments included above represent investments in unlisted Euro denominated securities that offer the Group the opportunity for return through fair value gains.
The securities have final maturity dates between 2009 and 2020, with options for early redemption at set intervals linked to the level of the Nikkei Index.
Market values have been determined by external security dealers using pricing models, based on various financial factors including bond prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and the Nikkei Index prices.
The total amount of the change in fair value estimated using a valuation technique that was recognised in profit or loss during the year was a gain of 3 million.
These assets are classified as held for trading.
Nature of main adjustment to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been applied from 1 April 2004 the following adjustment would have been necessary in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005: Available-for-sale investments and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss would have been carried at fair value rather than at cost.
This would have resulted in an increase of 6 million to the balance sheet value.
Details of the Groups principal subsidiary undertakings are included in the listing of Principal subsidiaries as at 31 March 2006.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is not materially different from their book value.
Restricted cash and short-term deposits The refinancing undertaken in 2004 provided for the allocation of certain funds to deal with the Groups legacy liabilities.
Such funds are to be held in an escrow account.
At 31 March 2006, the balance in this account was 219 million 2005: 309 million although further funds remain to be drawn down.
In addition, 58 million 2005: 111 million of cash and short-term deposits is cash collateral held in the ordinary course of business to provide security to third parties.
As an international Group, Invensys has operations in a number of territories such as China, Brazil and Russia which place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to lend money to other Group entities outside those territories.
However, distributions to the Group are permitted from audited reserves.
Credit risk The funds held in escrow as noted above are in the form of investments in the Deutsche Global Liquidity Series plc Managed USD, EUR and GBP Funds, each of which is triple-A rated.
There are no other significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in note 30.

These are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date but have been classified according to the terms of the respective facilities.
These loans and borrowings are secured by fixed and floating charges over certain Group companies assets.
5 million 2005: 3 million of such loans is classified as current liabilities.
The bonding facility is only able to be drawn as cash to finance or refinance cash collateral.
The available facility at 31 March 2006 is 410 million 2005: 389 million of which 277 million 2005: 213 million is drawn other than as a cash advance.
The borrowers have the right to prepay this Facility on five days notice, subject to conditions in other borrowing agreements.
Prepayment is at par and in the case of the bonding facility would, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, require the borrowers to place cash with the relevant Fronting Bank in the amounts outstanding.
The lenders have the right to seek early repayment following any Event of Default or Change of Control.
Prior to 5 March 2007, such prepayment would be at a price of 101%.

76 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 The Groups principal borrowing facilities are subject to several financial covenants.
The Group is subject to incurrence covenants which prohibit it from taking certain actions if the incurrence test is failed.
It is also subject to maintenance covenants which are tested on a regular basis.
Failure of the maintenance covenants would allow the lenders under the relevant agreement to call for immediate repayment of loans made to the Group.
Senior Notes due March 2011 These Notes carry only incurrence covenants which, if failed, restrict the ability of the Group to incur indebtedness beyond certain limits, pay dividends or similar payments.
To date the Group has not sought to undertake actions where such a test would require to have been passed.
Second Lien Facility maturing 5 December 2009 and Senior Credit Facility maturing 5 March 2009 to 5 September 2009 These facilities carry maintenance covenants that include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings, a minimum level of interest cover and a maximum level of capital expenditure.
The covenants measure these as a number and must show performance better than a defined scale, which changes over the period of the facilities.
To date the Group has shown ratios better then those required by the relevant agreements.
iii Undrawn committed facilities 2006 2005 m m Expiring in more than two years 316 348 316 348 As at 31 March 2006, the committed syndicated loan facilities available to the Group include a a 86 million US$149 million nonrevolving single currency loan facility which ceases to be available in September 2009: b a 27 million EUR 38 million non-revolving single currency loan facility which ceases to be available in September 2009: c a 105 million EUR 150 million second lien non-revolving single currency loan facility which ceases to be available in December 2009: d a 172 million US$300 million second lien non-revolving single currency loan facility which ceases to be available in December 2009: e a 208 million revolving multi-currency loan facility which ceases to be available in March 2009: and f a 410 million bonding facility which ceases to be available in March 2009.
22 Financial risk management and financial instruments The Groups treasury policy seeks to ensure that: adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Groups businesses, ensuring also long-term security in support of our products for the benefit of customers.
This includes the provision of funding for capital expenditure, working capital and the bonding requirements of our contract businesses: and financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty exposure is minimised as far as possible, as set out in the following sections, and that no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Group Treasury operates as a service centre from locations in the UK, the US and Singapore within clearly defined guidelines.
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to set the proportion of fixedand floating-rate debt taking into account factors such as the interest rate, the business cycle and the Groups level of financial leverage.
The Group has undertaken to ensure various ratios of fixed-rate debt to total debt in the period up to March 2007 in respect of US dollars and euros.
The Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward-rate agreements and currency swaps to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2006, 911 million of borrowings were in fixed-rate form, representing 120% of net debt and 75% of gross debt 2005: 926 million, representing 115% of net debt and 64% of gross debt.
Invensys plc 77 Annual report & accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Currency risk Translation exposure In common with other companies operating with many international subsidiaries, a currency risk arises on the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into sterling.
Similarly a currency risk arises on the translation of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries into sterling.
The Group targets several ratios in the management of this risk, including liabilities to net assets and earnings.
Transaction exposure Currency transaction exposure arises where actual revenue and purchases are made by the Groups businesses in a currency other than their own functional currency.
The incidence of this risk varies across the different businesses of the Group although the majority of revenues and purchases will usually be in the businesses local markets and in their respective functional currencies.
Where this is not the case, the Groups businesses are required to hedge 100% of their known exposures.
Policy also requires businesses to take action to protect any exposure where a bid is made which involves cash flows in non-functional currencies.
The Group uses forward currency contracts and currency options to manage transaction exposure.
Price risk The Groups exposure to changing market prices on the value of financial instruments has an impact on the carrying value of financial assets that are classified as available-for-sale and on financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
On 31 March 2006, the total carrying value of these financial assets was 17 million 2005: 16 million.
Counterparty risk The Group monitors the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as to control exposure to any territory or institution.
Surplus funds are placed for short periods with highly-rated institutions in investments that are readily realisable.
Funds placed in escrow arrangements are invested in US dollars, euros or sterling in highly-rated money market funds pending their requirement to meet legacy liabilities.
Derivatives Derivatives are used to manage the interest rate and currency risks described above and further detail is provided below.
March 2006 IFRS disclosures i Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year end exchange rates.
Receivables and payables have been included to the extent they are classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32.
Provisions have been included where there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 March was: Book Fair Book Fair value value value value 2006 2006 2005 2005 m m m m Financial assets Investments accounted for using the equity method 1111 Available-for-sale investments 4 4 8 11 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 13 13 8 11 Trade and other receivables 556 556 608 608 Cash and cash equivalents 450 450 638 638 Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate swaps 3 3 2 Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 1125 The directors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets approximate to their fair value.

The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued to customers.
The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered remote.
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties.
At 31 March 2006, the maximum credit risk to the Group arising from these guarantees was 8 million 2005: 10 million, being the total amount of such borrowings outstanding at that date.
Financial assets with a carrying value of up to 412 million being the total borrowings under secured loans see note 21 are subject to charges relating to such loans.
ii Interest rate profiles of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profiles of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in notes 20 and 21 respectively.
The Groups interest rate swaps are set out below.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been made to that effect in the relevant balance sheet notes.
iii Maturity analysis of interest bearing financial assets and liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups short and long-term borrowings is set out in note 21 and of the Groups cash and short-term deposits is set out in note 20. iv Derivative financial instruments A summary of derivative financial instruments is as follows: Fair Fair value value 2006 2005 m m Derivative assets 47 Derivative liabilities 2 4 23 The Group uses derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, currency transaction exposure and currency translation exposure.

The disclosure also includes forward contracts taken out by the Group to hedge expected future foreign currency sales and purchases.
viii Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2005 was as follows: Gross Other Financial borrowings liabilities liabilities 2005 2005 2005 m m m In one year or less, or on demand 29 304 333 In more than one year but not more than two years 20 20 In more than two years but not more than five years 742 742 In more than five years 640 640 1,431 304 1,735 As at 31 March 2005 the Group had 1,211 million of bank facilities to meet the maturity of these financial liabilities as they fell due.
Nature of main adjustment to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been applied from 1 April 2004 the following adjustment would have been necessary in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005: All derivatives would have been brought onto the balance sheet at fair value.
This would have resulted in a value of derivative assets of 7 million and a value of derivative liabilities of 4 million on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2005.
82 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 23 Assets and liabilities held for sale Following the adoption of IFRS 5 described more fully in note 34, assets and liabilities held for sale consist of: the Groups surplus freehold property portfolio: the assets and liabilities of a small business within Process Systems, sold on 19 April 2006: and the assets and liabilities of IBS Invensys Building Systems business in the US and Asia Pacific.

Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably.
This generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
Other provisions principally relate to onerous lease rentals in respect of vacant property, other onerous contracts and legal claims.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next five years.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value.
Invensys plc 83 Annual report & accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution schemes The Group operates many defined contribution schemes.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to 9 million 2005: 8 million.
At 31 March 2006, there were 1 million 2005: 1 million of outstanding contributions included in creditors.
ii Defined benefit schemes general The Group operates many funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme.
There are two main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme.
The Invensys Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a valuation date of 30 September 2005 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The assumptions that had the most effect on the results of this valuation for funding purposes are those relating to the discount rate on scheme liabilities and mortality assumptions.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries.
Of these the largest US scheme is assessed annually, and the other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent actuaries in accordance with local practice.
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired former employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2006. iii Defined benefit schemes major assumptions The major assumptions made when valuing the assets and liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows: For March 2006 the major financial assumptions are: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension Plan US Scheme UK US Other healthcare Other % %%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.15 4.00 3.63 2.47 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.35 1.91 1.68 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.95 6.05 5.11 6.05 4.76 Inflation rate 2.90 2.50 2.26 2.16 For March 2005 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension Plan US Scheme UK US Other healthcare Other % %%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.15 4.00 3.10 2.33 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.15 1.86 1.46 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.40 5.75 5.11 5.75 4.78 Inflation rate 2.90 2.50 2.01 1.91 For March 2004 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension Plan US Scheme UK US Other healthcare Other % %%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.15 4.00 3.20 1.50 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.15 1.80 1.30 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.50 6.00 5.20 6.00 5.10 Inflation rate 2.90 2.50 2.10 1.70 The assumptions used for medical trend rates for beneficiaries of the US healthcare scheme were 9.0% per annum, declining to an ultimate rate of 5.0% in 2006 2005: 10.0% declining to 5.0%: 2004: 11.5% declining to 5.0%.

Fair value of plan assets 3,494 624 215 4,333 The expected return on each asset class has been determined on the basis of market expectations for the rate of return on each asset class over the life of the related obligation, at the balance sheet date.
In respect of the UK scheme, Government and Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium has been applied to determine the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments.
Similar processes are applied to other schemes.
The Trustee of the UK scheme has recently adopted a new statement of investment principles which states that the Trustee will target a long-term rate of return on investments as a whole at 1% over Government stock of an appropriate duration: this would give an overall expected rate of return of 5.15% at the balance sheet date after allowing for scheme expenses.
In respect of the US plan, there has been a significant change in the expected rate of return on equities in the US due to a reduction in the assumed risk premium representing the excess return above US Government Bonds available on equities.

Cumulative actuarial gains and losses The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 April 2004 in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense is a loss of 138 million 2005: loss of 50 million.
The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of 606 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004. ix Pensions and post-retirement benefits other Total pension service costs charged to the income statement in respect of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes amounted to 45 million 2005: 49 million.

In addition, the Company will continue to make supplemental contributions to the scheme of 20 million per annum in each of the years ending 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2008, followed by contributions of 35 million per annum until the schemes deficit is eliminated.
Where the proceeds from the sale of a business exceed 1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be paid as additional contributions to the UK main scheme.
Under the main US plan, the Companys agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation provided for additional contributions of 4% of net proceeds from future disposals.

Interest payable on the Groups major borrowing facilities is settled either quarterly or half-yearly throughout the financial year.
Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll taxes, payroll creditors, customer advances not related to construction contracts, payments received from customers in advance of work performed on construction contracts and commissions payable.
The majority of non-current other payables will mature in more than one year but in less than two years: there is a small proportion that will mature in over five years.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

Vesting requirements: Performance requirements: a for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share EPS performance of RPI 12% over a three-year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of which is the year preceding that in which the option will lapse: b for grants made between 25 July 2001 and 16 June 2002 EPS of RPI 12% in the three years after grant or EPS of RPI 16% in the four years after grant or EPS of RPI 20% in the five years after grant, failing which the option will lapse: and c for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder return TSR performance against a peer group of the FTSE 100 over a performance period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant.
40% will be exercisable if median position is achieved, rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved.
Between these two points the option will vest on a straight-line basis.
If the performance condition is not met in full at the first measurement then it will be re-tested against the fixed base in years four and five.
If the median position is not achieved by the end of the fifth year the option will lapse.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use: the Company does not propose to operate the Scheme, except in the case of recruitment situations, where it may be considered appropriate.
Hence no options were granted during the years ended 31 March 2006 or 31 March 2005.
Other arrangements: one option was granted under a separate arrangement to the incoming Chief Operating Officer now Chief Executive, Ulf Henriksson, during the year ended 31 March 2005 as detailed below: Option granted in year ended 31 March 2005 Total number of awards granted 5,000,000 Weighted average fair value 11.00p Weighted average share price 16.00p Exercise price 16.55p Expected volatility 75.00% Expected option life 6 years Expected dividend yield 0.00% Risk free interest rate 5.21% Details of executive share options outstanding under this scheme, and including the option granted to Mr Henriksson during the year ended 31 March 2005, are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted Number average Number average of share exercise of share exercise Share option transactions options price p options price p Outstanding at the beginning of the year 110,007,580 142.58p 125,430,427 150.67p Granted during the year 5,000,000 16.55p Forfeited during the year 6,652,354 154.79p 203,666 161.64p Exercised during the year Lapsed during the year 43,330,572 155.44p 20,219,181 161.36p Outstanding at the end of the year 60,024,654 131.94p 110,007,580 142.58p Invensys plc 95 Annual report & accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Share-based payment plans continued The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.7 years 2005: 6.5 years and the range of exercise prices was between 16.55p and 318.95p.
Long term incentives Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Grant details: a long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to directors and senior executives at no or nominal cost.
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: a a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment unless the Company determines otherwise : b a conditional share award: or c a cash award granted in respect of a notional number of shares.
Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period.
For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years: for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements: Performance requirements: TSR test a Awards granted prior to 28 May 2003: TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee with no re-testing opportunities.
TSR must rank at the median position when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR in order for 50% of the shares subject to the award to be available subject to the retention period, rising to 100% of the shares if the upper quartile position is achieved.
Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
If at least median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse.
The peer group selected for the relevant grant was as follows: award dated 4 December 2002: the companies that comprised the FTSE 100 Index on the dealing day preceding 4 December 2002: and b awards granted after 28 May 2003: the same TSR performance test that applies to awards granted prior to this date, save that 25% of the shares subject to the award will be available subject to the retention period, if TSR ranks at the median position when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR, rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved.
The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows: awards granted on 20 June 2003, 13 November 2003, 24 June 2004, 30 September 2004, 1 December 2004 and 21 December 2004: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of the grant: and awards granted on 22 July 2005, 10 November 2005 and 27 February 2006: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group, Yokagawa.
Overall performance test a For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained delivery over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group indebtedness: and b for the awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: 1 achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets: and 2 efficient management of legacy liability items.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee after the completion of the first two years of the performance period.
Scheme use: currently used as the sole long-term incentive: the intention is to continue to make awards under this plan in 2006 07 and subsequently.

Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use: the use of the Scheme and potential future launches are reviewed on a regular basis.
No options were granted under this Scheme during the year ended 31 March 2006.

98 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 Invensys Overseas Savings Related Share Option Scheme Grant details: the Scheme operates in a number of overseas countries where it has proved advantageous and practicable based on the numbers of eligible employees and local legal and tax requirements.
It is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees.
Vesting requirements: Performance requirements: There are no performance conditions, other than that a participant is required to complete the savings contract in order to exercise their options.
Scheme use: the use of the scheme and potential future launches are reviewed on a regular basis.
No options were granted under this Scheme during the years ended 31 March 2005 or 31 March 2006.

Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan In addition to the schemes detailed above, the Group has introduced the Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan TBO under which executives have the opportunity to receive a supplemental bonus of up to 100% of their base salary in respect of any financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels of performance.
The TBO will operate in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan.
Any bonuses earned under the TBO will be payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those shares being awarded and the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.
Release of the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee has committed that the TBO will not be operated in respect of years after 2007 08.
There are currently no grants outstanding under the TBO.
The first grants under the TBO will be made shortly, having been approved at the Remuneration Committee of 23 May 2006.
Measurement of fair value The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the year.
An adjusted market value method of valuation, based on market value at grant date, adjusted for expected forfeitures and market-based performance conditions has been used to calculate the fair value of all other awards i. e. LTIP and RSP awards.
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous 10 years and on the implied volatility of traded options of the Groups shares.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share-based payment expense The Group recognised total expenses of 8 million 2005: 3 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Invensys plc 99 Annual report & accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Commitments and contingencies Capital expenditure Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment contracted at the balance sheet date but for which no provision has been made in the accounts amounted to 3 million 2005: 6 million.
Operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain land and buildings, motor vehicles and items of plant and equipment.
Land and buildings leases are generally subject to periodic rent reviews.
Some leases have renewal options.
These are at the option of the Group, sometimes subject to a minimum notice period.
In some cases rent escalations are set out in the lease contract.
There are no material contingent rents payable.
No significant restrictions are placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.

The Group leases a small proportion of its properties, plant and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term is 16 years for properties and 4 years for plant and machinery.
For the year ended 31 March 2006, the average effective borrowing rate was 10% 2005: 9%.
Leases are generally on a fixed repayment basis, with no material contingent amounts payable.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
These leases have terms of renewal and or purchase options at the option of the Group.
One property is subject to a sale and leaseback arrangement and will be purchased by the Group when the lease expires in 2008.
Provision has been made for the amount by which the purchase price is expected to exceed market value.
There are no significant escalation clauses and no significant restrictions are placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.
The Groups finance lease liabilities are secured against the assets to which they relate.
100 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 Contingent liabilities In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties.
At 31 March 2006, the maximum contingent liability to the Group arising from these guarantees was 8 million 2005: 10 million, being the total amount of such borrowings outstanding at that date.
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of bank loans and overdrafts and bank indemnities totalling 990 million 2005: 990 million.
Neither Invensys, nor any other member of the Group, is engaged in, nor so far as the directors are aware has pending, or threatened by, or against it any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group.

102 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 34 Transition to IFRSs For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2005 the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 March 2006, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union EU.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRSs applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in the accounting policies section of these Group financial statements.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRSs, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Reporting Standards.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005.
IFRS transitional arrangements The Group has applied the rules for first-time adoption of IFRS as set out in IFRS 1.
IFRS 1 requires use of the same accounting policies in the IFRS transition balance sheet and for all periods presented thereafter.
These policies must comply with all IFRS effective at the reporting date for the first financial reporting under IFRS.
In general, for the first-time adoption of IFRS, accounting standards are applied retrospectively.
However IFRS 1 permits a number of optional exemptions, as well as prohibiting retrospective application of some aspects of other IFRS.
The Group has adopted the following optional exemptions under IFRS 1: a business combinations prior to 1 April 2004 have not been restated to comply with IFRS 3, Business Combinations: b all cumulative actuarial gains and losses with respect to employee benefits have been recognised in shareholders equity at 1 April 2004: c cumulative translation differences on foreign operations are deemed to be zero at 1 April 2004.
Any gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income statement on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will therefore exclude translation differences arising prior to the transition date: d IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, have been applied for the first time in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, with no restatement of comparative information.
Financial instruments recognised prior to 1 April 2005, the date of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, were designated at the date of IAS 32 and IAS 39 transition as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, net investment hedges and at fair value through profit and loss, rather than at their inception: and e the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, have not been applied to equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005.
Consistent with the application of the exemption explained in a above, goodwill arising on business combinations between 1998 and 1 April 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Accounting policies applied in the year ended 31 March 2005 As noted above, the Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 April 2005 and under the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 has not restated comparative information.
The accounting policies that have been applied for the year ended 31 March 2006 are set out in the accounting policies section of these Group financial statements.
For the year ended 31 March 2005 the following UK GAAP accounting policies were applied in respect of financial instruments in the financial statements of the Group.
Financial instruments The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
These instruments are accounted for as hedges when, at the inception of the contract, they both meet the criteria for treatment as a hedge and are designated as a hedge.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value for disclosure only.
They are not shown on the consolidated balance sheet.
Interest payments and receipts are accrued and included in net interest payable as an adjustment of the interest expense of the designated liability.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards Where foreign exchange swaps and forwards are used to adjust the currency profile of net borrowings which are matched to net assets of subsidiaries, realised and unrealised gains and losses are taken directly to reserves.
Where foreign exchange forwards are used to hedge foreign currency trade debtors and creditors, realised and unrealised gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
Where the instrument is used to hedge against future transactions, gains and losses are not recognised until the transaction occurs.
Debt instruments New borrowings are initially recognised at net proceeds received after deduction of issue costs.
The issue costs of debt instruments are amortised at a constant rate on the carrying amount of the related debt, over the life of the instrument.
Invensys plc 103 Annual report & accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 34 Transition to IFRSs continued Key changes in accounting under IFRS The differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that have had the most significant effect on the Groups reported results are set out below.
The resulting adjustments made to equity at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005 and profit or loss for the year ended 31 March 2005 as previously reported under UK GAAP are set out in the reconciliations that follow.
The adjustments had no material impact on cash resources and the reported cash flows generated by the Group.
IAS 38, Intangible Assets IAS 38 requires the costs incurred on development projects that meet certain criteria to be recognised as intangible assets in the balance sheet.
The Groups policy under UK GAAP was to expense all such costs as they were incurred.
The application of the IAS 38 criteria resulted in the costs of a number of current and recent development projects being recognised as intangible assets in the balance sheet under IFRS.
However, it was not possible in all cases to assess accurately whether costs expensed under UK GAAP prior to the IFRS transition date met the IAS 38 criteria for recognition at the time they were incurred.
IFRS does not permit such assessments to be performed retrospectively and with the benefit of hindsight, so where contemporary records were insufficiently detailed or unavailable it has not been possible to recognise the asset under IAS 38.
Procedures are now in place to monitor research and development projects against the IAS 38 criteria and recognise their costs as intangible assets when they meet those criteria.
Under IAS 38, intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives, which for current projects are between 4 and 10 years.
The Group does not expect any of its intangible assets to have indefinite useful lives.
IAS 32 and IAS 39, Financial Instruments The Group enters into derivative instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Under UK GAAP, these instruments were measured at cost and accounted for as hedges, whereby gains and losses were deferred until the underlying transaction occurred.
Under IFRS, derivative instruments are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
In order to achieve hedge accounting under IFRS, certain criteria must be met regarding documentation, designation and effectiveness of the hedge.
When a derivative is used to hedge the change in fair value of a recognised asset, liability or firm commitment, the change in fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognised in the income statement when they occur.
For a hedge of changes in the future cash flows relating to a recognised asset or liability or to a probable forecast transaction, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in equity until those future cash flows occur.
As mentioned above, the Group has applied IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the first time for the year ended 31 March 2006.
As permitted by the transitional exemption available under IFRS 1, IAS 32 and IAS 39 have not been applied to the comparative information presented in these financial statements.
The comparative information is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
If IAS 39 had been applied for the year to 31 March 2005, the market value of derivative financial instruments would have been recognised in the balance sheet with the changes in their value accounted for through the income statement or reserves.
The effect on total equity at 1 April 2005 of implementing IAS 39 was an increase of 10 million.
IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Under UK GAAP the Group was able to designate external foreign currency borrowings held by holding companies in the United Kingdom as a hedge of foreign currency denominated assets including goodwill previously written off to reserves.
As a result the foreign exchange gains and losses on the borrowings were matched against the gains and losses on the assets and recognised in reserves.
Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not recognised as a qualifying asset under IFRS, and is therefore not available to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the borrowings.
As a result, under IFRS there are exchange differences that impact the income statement.
These are disclosed separately on the face of the income statement.
IFRS 3, Business Combinations Under IFRS 3, goodwill recognised in the balance sheet is no longer amortised.
Instead it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
All goodwill recognised on the balance sheet at the date of transition to IFRS was tested for impairment at that date.
No impairment was identified and no other adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were made.
On the disposal of a business, IFRS does not require any related goodwill previously written off to reserves to be transferred to the income statement.
The recognition in the income statement of disposals made after the date of transition has been restated to reflect this.
The Group adopted the exemption under IFRS 1 from restating business combinations prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
The Group has applied IFRS 3 prospectively from IFRS transition.
No significant business combinations have been undertaken since the transition date.
Other areas of change IAS 12, Income Taxes, requires that deferred taxation is provided on substantially all differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities except those arising from goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes.
This is wider than under UK GAAP, which specifically does not permit the recognition of certain timing differences, including those that relate to revaluations where no sale is in process, or where it is probable that rollover relief or losses will be applied to the gain.
The application of IFRS has resulted in the recognition of additional deferred tax balances including those relating to undistributed overseas retained earnings which are intended to be repatriated in the foreseeable future.
Subject to any constraints arising from the legal requirements of those territories, the Group intends to repatriate overseas earnings from territories where overseas funds exist in excess of local operating requirements.
104 Invensys plc Annual report & accounts 2006 In accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, additional liabilities were recognised on transition for accumulating compensated absences earned as a result of services rendered.
IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, requires the recognition of all share-based payments in the income statement, although this had only a limited impact on the Groups reported results for the year to 31 March 2005.
The charge has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model because of the relatively small number of relevant share options extant.
As permitted by the transitional exemption available under IFRS 1, the requirements of IFRS 2 have not been applied to equity instruments granted before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005.
IAS 17, Leases, contains more specific guidance on the criteria that determine whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.
As a result two property leases and a few equipment leases have been reclassified as finance leases.
Presentation of the financial statements under IFRS For the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group presents its financial statements in accordance with IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.
Where IAS 1 does not provide definitive guidance on presentation, for example in relation to aspects of the income statement, the Group has adopted a format consistent with UK GAAP requirements to assist in comparing results with prior years.
The presentation of the balance sheet under IFRS differs from the requirements under UK GAAP in a number of respects.
These include requirements to analyse all assets and liabilities, including provisions, between current and non-current: and to categorise computer software, treated as tangible fixed assets under UK GAAP, as intangible assets.
The results of discontinued operations have been reclassified so as to be presented at the foot of the income statement in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
The Group did not adopt IFRS 5 ahead of its effective date which was 1 April 2005 for Invensys.
Accordingly, the comparative balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 2005 has not been adjusted for assets and liabilities classified as held for resale.
The IFRS cash flow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP with cash flows split into three categories of activities operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
The reconciling items between the UK GAAP presentation and the IFRS presentation have no net impact on the cash flows generated.
The adoption of IFRS by EU member states applies only to consolidated financial statements.
Invensys continues to present its Parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
Consequently Parent company financial statements are presented separately from the Group financial statements.
