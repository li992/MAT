The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005.
2006 2005 Dividend yield % 1.5 1.5 Expected share price volatility % 24.76 37.80 Risk free interest rate % 4.5 4.5 Expected life of option years 4.43 4.49 Weighted average share price 4.97 3.78 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
