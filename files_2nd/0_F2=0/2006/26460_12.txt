DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the independent auditors report on page 39, is made with a view to FINANCIAL STATEMENTS distinguishing for shareholders the responsibilities of the directors from those of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare an Annual Report and financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The directors consider that in preparing the financial statements the Company and the Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all applicable accounting standards have been followed.
ACCOUNTING RECORDS The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company and the Group keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
SAFEGUARDING ASSETS The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Groups website is the responsibility of the directors.
