Financial Statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 20 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In many countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment medical plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Exposure to risks Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 17 278 million and 20 358 million respectively are held on the Groups balance sheet as at 31 December 2006.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates, ination and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits in these schemes, and could prompt the need for the Group to make additional pension contributions, or to reduce pension contributions, in the future.
The key assumptions used to value our pension liabilities are set out below and on page 104.
Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the company of the benets provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversied, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The pension funds also have a proportion of assets invested in property, bonds and cash.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplied externally managed investment solution to implement their strategic asset allocation models initially for equities.
The aim is to provide a high quality, well diversied risk-controlled solution.
significant Items on the face of the Income Statement During 2006 we updated certain terms of the dened benefit plan in the UK which resulted in a one-off credit to the income statement in 2006 of 120 million.
During 2006 a number of initiatives were taken to reduce the cost of healthcare benets, principally in the United States, through changes to the design of the plans.
As a consequence, a reduction in liability of 146 million was recognised in the income statement for 2006.
Assumptions With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit pension plans covering approximately 96% of pension liabilities the principal pension plans and plans providing other post-employment benets, and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: million million 1% point 1% point increase decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components 4 3 Effect on total benefit obligation 51 47 The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
Mortality assumptions for the most important countries are based on the following post-retirement mortality tables: i United Kingdom: PMA 92 and PFA 92 with short cohort adjustment and scaling factor of 125% applied, projected to 2015 for current pensioners and to 2025 for future pensioners: ii the Netherlands: GBMV 1995-2000 with age set back of four years for males and two years for females: iii United States: RP2000 with a projection period of 10-15 years: and iv Germany: Heubeck 1998 Periodentafel with a scaling factor of 85%.
These tables translate into the following years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65: United United Kingdom Netherlands States Germany Males 19 18 19 18 Females 22 21 22 21 As considered appropriate having regard to the factors set out above, the assumptions and approach adopted allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.
