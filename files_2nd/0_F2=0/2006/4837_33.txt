Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Goodwill 2006 2005 million million Cost At beginning of period 1,004.2 937.1 Acquisitions 34.7 41.2 Transfer from associated undertakings 20.1 Currency retranslation 48.7 5.8 At end of period 1,087.6 1,004.2 As required by IFRS 3, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
These reviews are carried out using the following criteria: An amount of goodwill is attributed to each specific acquisition.
Such acquisitions are determined to be a Cash Generating Unit CGU as determined by IAS 36 Impairment.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on calculating its value in use.
The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP or Consumer Prices Index CPI.
The value in use is compared with the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The most significant components of goodwill relate to Elkjp ASA Elkjp and UniEuro S. p. A. UniEuro and are as follows: Key assumptions for 2006 Growth Pre tax rate beyond risk adjusted 2006 2005 five years discount rate million million Elkjp 2.0% 10.9% 528.5 489.9 UniEuro 1.4% 13.2% 431.4 421.0 The growth rate beyond five years applied for Elkjp is based on GDP.
The growth rate beyond five years applied for UniEuro is based on the mid point in a range of growth rates in GDP and CPI provided by third parties.
The directors believe that this rate provides an appropriate reflection of the growth rate in the product markets in which UniEuro operates.
A sensitivity analysis had been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill.
In the case of Elkjp, the directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of UniEuro, the forecasts are most sensitive to the pre tax risk adjusted discount rate and the growth rate beyond five years.
The directors consider it reasonably possible that a change in these assumptions could occur over the course of the next financial period.
An increase of 0.7 per cent in the pre tax risk adjusted discount rate or a decrease of 1.15 per cent in the growth rate beyond five years would cause the current headroom of 27.1 million in the value in use over the carrying amount of the goodwill to erode to nil.
