17 FinanciaL asset In April 2005, the Group entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement Agreement with an economic effective date of 1 January 2005, to sell its 100% owned subsidiaries SOCO Tamtsag Mongolia, LLC SOTAMO and SOCO Mongolia Ltd SOCO Mongolia to Daqing Oilfield Limited Company Daqing, a subsidiary of PetroChina.
Together SOTAMO and SOCO Mongolia held the Groups Mongolia interest.
In August 2005 the Group completed the transaction.
Under the terms of the Agreement the Group will receive consideration of up to approximately $93.0 million comprised of cash consideration of $40.0 million plus a subsequent payment based on total crude oil produced from the Mongolia interest after the effective date in excess of 27.8 million barrels of oil.
The $40.0 million cash consideration was payable in two tranches.
The first $30.0 million was paid, less applicable settlement adjustments of $0.4 million, in August 2005 upon completion.
The second tranche of $10.0 million was paid into an interest bearing escrow account by Daqing upon completion to be released to the Group 18 months later upon the satisfaction of the condition that no material undisclosed additional liabilities are discovered.
In February 2007 the second tranche was released in full to the Group.
An amount of $10.7 million 2005 $10.1 million recorded within non-current assets other receivables which includes accrued interest is included in the balance sheet under current assets as an other receivable see Note 20.
The remaining consideration is payable, once cumulative production reaches 27.8 million barrels of oil as described above, at the rate of 20% of the average monthly posted marker price for Daqing crude multiplied by the aggregate production for that month, up to a total of approximately $52.7 million based on the estimated recoverable costs incurred to 31 December 2004, as approved by the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority of Mongolia.
The subsequent payment amount is included in non-current assets as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.
The timescale for the production of crude oil in excess of 27.8 million barrels and the price of Daqing marker crude oil are factors that cannot accurately be predicted.
However, based upon the Directors current estimates of proven and probable reserves from the Mongolia interests and the development scenarios as discussed with the buyer, the Directors believe that the full subsequent payment amount will be payable.
The fair value of the subsequent payment amount was determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market against which direct comparisons can be made.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair value include the factors mentioned above, risked as appropriate, with the resultant cash flows discounted at a commercial risk free interest rate.
The fair value of the financial asset at the date of completion of the sale was $31.5 million.
As at 31 December 2006 the fair value was $32.6 million 2005 $31.9 million after accounting for the change in fair value see Note 7.
