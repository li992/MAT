Goodwill arising from business combinations in the year has been allocated to business segments as follows: 2006 m Commercial & Electrical 3.1 Oil, Chemical & Agri 17.8 Total goodwill 20.9 52 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The carrying amount of goodwill by business segment is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Consumer Goods 5.0 5.2 Commercial & Electrical 19.5 17.9 Oil, Chemical & Agri 46.6 32.6 Total goodwill net book value at 31 December 71.1 55.7 Total goodwill of 71.1m 2005: 55.7m is attributable to 50 2005: 43 acquired businesses which are grouped into 39 2005: 33 cash generating units.
Each of these cash generating units has been tested for impairment in accordance with the Groups accounting policy described on page 44.
Detailed results of the impairment tests for material acquisitions with goodwill in excess of 10% of total goodwill are presented below.
Material acquisitions 2006 2005 m m Commercial & Electrical Entela 8.8 9.6 Oil, Chemical & Agri Alta Analytical Laboratories 10.2 Oil, Chemical & Agri Automotive Research 9.1 10.2 Other each less than 10% of total goodwill 43.0 35.9 Total goodwill net book value at 31 December 71.1 55.7 The goodwill for Entela is denominated in US dollars and the decrease in value of goodwill from 9.6m to 8.8m is due to foreign currency translation.
The goodwill for Automotive Research is denominated in US dollars and the decrease in value of goodwill from 10.2m to 9.1m is due to foreign currency translation.
Each of the acquisitions offers similar services to those already offered by the Intertek Groups existing businesses, therefore it is considered appropriate to use the same assumptions in each of the impairment calculations.
In each case the recoverable amount of the acquired business determined upon the value-in-use calculation, was higher than its carrying amount.
Management approved forecasts for each cash generating unit are used in these calculations.
These forecasts cover a two year period and are based on the most current information relating to each business unit.
Beyond two years, management consider that it is dif cult to accurately forecast business growth for each individual unit.
In Interteks business, most contractual relationships with customers are short term.
Despite this, the Group has a strong historical track record of growth.
Intertek is supporting global trade which grows faster than GDP and our underlying markets are expected to continue to show good growth.
Therefore, when looking at longer term growth, a steady growth rate of 5% is used for all business units.
This is considered to be a reasonable assumption based on the long term historical growth rate in pro ts of the Intertek business, and the post acquisition performance of businesses acquired.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been used in these calculations.
The characteristics of the businesses acquired are that they are not capital intensive and are largely similar to each other and the Group, and therefore the pre-tax discount rate of 12% which is based on the Groups cost of capital, is considered the most appropriate rate.
The key sensitivity for the impairment test is the growth in operating pro t. Had the overall growth rate been reduced by 1% to 4%, the carrying amount would still not have exceeded the recoverable amount.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report 53 Notes to the financial statements 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued An increase of 1% in the discount rate assumption would not change the conclusions of the impairment tests.
There are 36 2005: 31 cash generating units with a goodwill amount that is not signi cant in relation to the carrying value of goodwill of 71.1m 2005: 55.7m.
The aggregate balance of goodwill for these multiple cash generating units is 43.0 2005: 35.8m.
The recoverable amount of all these units was determined following the same assumptions as for the individually signi cant units disclosed above.
An impairment charge of 0.3m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Oil, Chemical & Agri division in respect of the goodwill of Eurolabo, a company registered in Estonia and acquired by the Group in 2005.
This was necessitated by lower than expected trading results in the period since acquisition.
The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value-in-use, using projected cash ows for this company, discounted by a pre-tax rate of 12%.
The charge of 0.3m represented the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value which, after the impairment, was 0.1m.
No other goodwill impairment losses were identi ed.
In 2005, an impairment charge of 2.0m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Consumer Goods division, in respect of the goodwill of Fastech, a company acquired by the Group in 2003.
The charge of 2.0m represented the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value which, after the impairment, was 3.3m.
There are no intangible assets with inde nite lives.

There is a temporary difference of 16.4m 2005: 11.4m which relates to unremitted post acquisition overseas earnings.
No deferred tax is provided for on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from or sell the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.

There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short term duration.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers whom are internationally dispersed.

The facility was for five years expiring on 15 December 2009, with the option to extend this for a further two years.
The facility was extended by a year in 2005 and by a further year in 2006.
The facility now expires in December 2011.
The facility comprises three tranches.
Facility A is a 42.0m multi-currency term loan original 70.0m less repayments to 31 December 2006 with bi-annual amortisations over the remaining three years.
Facility B is a 150.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility, available up to 15 December 2011.
Facility C is a 364 day, 80.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility, with the option to convert this into a one year loan by the end of the 364 day period.
Advances under Facilities A and B bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR as adjusted plus a margin.
The margin over LIBOR is in the range of 0.4% to 0.6% in accordance with a leverage grid.
As at 31 December 2006, the margin was 0.45%.
Advances under Facility C initially bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR as adjusted plus a margin.
The margin over LIBOR is in the range 0.3% to 0.5% in accordance with a leverage grid.
As at 31 December 2006, the margin was 0.35%.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities, which mature in 2011, amounted to 86.4m 2005: 95.5m having taken into account 7.1m 2005: 5.8m utilised for letters of credit and guarantees.

The outcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of 4.0m 2005: 8.0m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identi ed claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash out ow relating to the provisions is uncertain but is likely to be within one year.
During 2006, a lawsuit led in Puerto Rico in 2002 against one of the Groups subsidiaries in the US, was settled and the lawsuit dismissed.
Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 27.
On the expiry of certain contracts, the Group is required to incur costs to dispose of assets, repair premises and reduce headcount.
The other provision of 0.5m 2005: 0.9m is an estimate of the cost of meeting these obligations.
The provision is likely to be utilised over a period of one to ten years.

Intertek Group plc Annual Report 59 Notes to the financial statements 22 Employee bene ts Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are fide ned contribution arrangements.
However, there are signi cant fide ned bene t schemes in the United Kingdom and in Hong Kong.
These are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Other funded fide ned bene t schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were fide ned contribution schemes.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002 and 1 December 2000, respectively.
The Group recognises any actuarial gains and losses in each period in equity through the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.

The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such assets at the balance sheet date.
A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments.
This is based on an out-performance assumption over gilt yields.

Exposures to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to uctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
a Credit risk Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties who have sound credit ratings.
Given this, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At the balance sheet date there were no signi cant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report 67 Notes to the financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued b Interest rate risk Hedging The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 33% and 67% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a xed rate basis.
Interest rate swaps, denominated in various currencies, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of xed and oating rate exposure within the Groups policy.
The swaps mature over the next two years and have xed swap rates ranging from 2.9% to 5.3%.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 97.4m 2005: 110.4m.
The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in cash ow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of swaps at 31 December 2006, was 0.4m 2005: 1.7m comprising assets of 0.4m 2005: 1.7m and liabilities of nil 2005: nil.
These amounts were recognised as fair value derivatives.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at speci ed intervals, the difference between xed rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.

Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups pro t is exposed to exchange rate uctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency uctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency uctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash ows in various currencies.
Recognised assets and liabilities Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of forward exchange contracts was nil 2005: nil.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the loans at 31 December 2006, was 178.4m 2005: 190.7m.
A foreign exchange gain of 20.5m 2005: loss of 16.1m was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans to sterling.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report 69 Notes to the financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued d Fair values The table below sets out a comparison of the book values and corresponding fair values of all the Groups financial instruments by category.

Derivatives For interest rate swaps, bank valuations are used.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value is the same as book value as the oating interest rates were reset just prior to the year end.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to re ect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash ows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
e Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term uctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2006, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups pro t before tax by approximately 0.5m 2005: 0.5m.
Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of the sterling against the dollar the main currency impacting the Group would have decreased the Groups pro t before tax for 2006 by approximately 0.7m 2005: 0.6m.
The forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
27 Contingent liabilities 2006 2005 m m Guarantees, letters of credit and performance bonds 6.4 5.8 Litigation From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes with former employees.
The Group is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
