Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 | 101 Parent company accounts Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2006 continued 10 Staff costs and share-based payments continued The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair values are determined according to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, except in the case of share awards under the PRP and ESOP schemes which contain performance conditions based on total shareholder return compared to other entities in the Media and Entertainment sector, and which are valued by external experts using a Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model.
The fair value per option for options granted in the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 2006 2005 Scheme type PRP SAYE 21 SAYE 21 PRP SAYE 20 SAYE 20 Grant date 19 July 2005 13 Jan 2006 13 Jan 2006 24 July 2004 17 Dec 2004 17 Dec 2004 Share price at grant date 822.0p 846.2p 846.2p 725.0p 809.0p 809.0p Exercise price nil 676.9p 676.9p nil 640.3p 640.3p Vesting period years 3.0 3.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 Expected volatility 24.0% 22.4% 28.3% 32.0% 27.6% 30.6% Option life years 10.0 3.6 5.6 10.0 3.7 5.7 Expected life years 3.5 3.2 5.2 3.5 3.3 5.3 Risk free rate 4.2% 4.1% 4.1% 5.2% 4.5% 4.5% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 3.03% 2.9% 2.9% 3.24% 2.9% 2.9% TSR correlation 21% n a n a 20% n a n a SAYE fair value per option 218.3p 264.9p 238.0p 275.0p PRP fair value per option Basic award 743.0p 651.0p PRP fair value per option Performance award EPS element 743.0p 651.0p PRP fair value per option Performance award TSR element 361.0p 351.0p The expected volatility is based on Emaps historical volatility averaged over a period equal to the expected life.

In April 2005, under the staff Share Plan scheme, 312,708 April 2004: 265,832 free shares were issued in trust to employees with a vesting period of three years.
Employees receive dividends during the period and the fair value per share was 794.5 pence April 2004: 864.5 pence, the market price at the date of issue.
In July each year staff are invited under the Sharemap scheme to save a monthly amount for a year and to then use their savings to purchase Emap shares.
The purchase price is the lower of the share price at the beginning and end of the savings period.
Emap also matches the number of shares acquired by the employee and these are placed in trust with a vesting period of three years.
There is a charge to the income statement for the one year savings period and the three year vesting period and the assumptions and fair values are as follows: Sharemap Sharemap 2006 2005 Start of savings period 1 July 2005 1 July 2004 End of savings period 30 June 2006 30 June 2005 Savings amount at grant date 784,560 740,912 Share price at grant date 795.0p 727.5p Expected volatility 16.3% 23.3% Risk free rate 4.2% 4.8% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 3.1% 3.2% Fair value for 1 year savings period 54p 70p Fair value for 3 year vesting period 840.8p 786.9p Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 | 102
