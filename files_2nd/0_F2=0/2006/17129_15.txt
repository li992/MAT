The address of the registered office is Greenside House, 50 Station Road, London N22 7TP.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Group has historically prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices UK GAAP.
A European Union EU Regulation issued in 2002 now requires the Group to report its results for the period ending 26 December 2006 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Commission.
The date of adoption and transition for the Group was the 29 December 2004 being the start of the period of comparative information.
At the date of authorisation of these Group financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these Group financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures: IFRS 8 Operating segments: IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives: IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment: IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: group and treasury share transactions: and IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 37.
IFRS 1 sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its Group financial statements.
Under IFRS 1 the Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 26 December 2006 and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at its date of transition, 29 December 2004.
IFRS 1 provides a number of optional exceptions to this general principle.
The most significant of these are set out below, together with a description in each case of whether an exception has been adopted by the Group.
Business combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the 30 December 2003.
As a result, in the opening balance sheet, goodwill arising from past business combinations amounting to 733.3m remains as stated under UK GAAP at 30 December 2003.
Employee benefits The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at 29 December 2004.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, issued on 16 December 2004.
Share-based payments The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to all relevant share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Financial instruments The Group has applied IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for all periods presented and has therefore not taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 that would enable the Group to only apply these standards from 28 December 2005.
47 General The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 26 December 2006.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combination On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Investment in associate An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these Group financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from customers and represents amounts receivable for goods and services that the Group is in business to provide, as set out below.
In the case of the LBO, telephone, interactive sportsbook businesses and online casino operations including games on the online arcade and other numbers bets, revenue represents gains and losses from betting activity in the period.
Open positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue, as well as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
Revenue from the online poker business reflects the net income rake earned from poker games completed by the period end.
48 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Statement of Group Accounting Policies Statement of Group Accounting Policies William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Revenue recognition continued Amounts wagered represents the gross takings receivable from customers in respect of individual bets placed in the period on events for LBO, telephone and interactive sports businesses, net winnings on gaming activity completed by period end for AWP and online casinos and net income earned from poker games completed by period end.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, including sales of refreshments and tote income.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group makes every effort to match its foreign currency assets and liabilities.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Finance costs Finance costs of borrowings are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of those borrowings at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging exceptional items and after the share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
49 Retirement benefit costs continued For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are included in finance costs and investment income as appropriate.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties over the unexpired period of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment and motor vehicles at variable rates between 3 and 10 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets.
Internally generated intangible assets computer software and systems Expenditure on initial investigation and design of computer software and systems is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
50 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Statement of Group Accounting Policies Statement of Group Accounting Policies William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Internally generated intangible assets computer software and systems continued An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development of computer systems is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: An asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally between three and ten years.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets licences Betting licences are recorded at cost or if arising in an acquisition at their fair value.
They are judged to have an indefinite life and are accordingly not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
The directors consider that the Groups licences have an indefinite life due to: the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a well established market: the proven and sustained demand for bookmaking services: the operation of current law that acts as a barrier to entry for new entrants: and the Groups track record of successfully renewing its betting permits and licences.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows, which are based on the budgeted figures for the following year and subsequently an annual growth rate of 2.4%, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories represent stocks of consumables in stores and goods for resale within the greyhound stadia.
They are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment from 31 December 2003.
In accordance with the transition provisions included in IFRS 2, its provisions have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme open to all eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount.
The cost to the Group of share-based payment plans is measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formula.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimates, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take into account any market conditions applicable to the option.
Further descriptions of the Groups share-based payment plans are given in note 34.
51 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits held by the Group with an original maturity of three months or less.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial liability and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method.
Any accrued finance costs are included in accruals and deferred income within trade and other payables.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap and collar contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure and retains cash balances in foreign currencies matched against its foreign currency liabilities client deposit accounts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Bets are carried at fair market value as they meet the definition of a derivative.
The resulting gains and losses from bets are included in revenue.
Assets or liabilities resulting from open positions are reported gross in financial assets and financial liabilities under the term Derivative financial instruments.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.

There were no exceptional items in the period and therefore the effective tax rate in respect of ordinary activities after exceptional items was 29.6% 52 weeks ended 27 December 2005 35.7%.
The current periods charge is lower than the statutory rate of 30% due to adjustments in relation to prior periods.
The prior period rate after exceptional items was higher than the statutory rate of 30% due to: Chargeable gains arising on the sale of the Stanley Retail LBOs being treated as part of the tax charge whereas for accounting purposes the gains are dealt with in arriving at goodwill: and The Group incurred a number of expenses on which it did not get tax relief.

William Hill Organization Limiteds shareholding has increased in the period from 19% to 20.95% due to SIS repurchasing and cancelling a portion of its ordinary share capital.
The investment has been accounted for as an associated undertaking using the equity method and the change in the Groups share of its net assets is shown above.
The SIS group of companies provides real time pre-event information and results, as well as live coverage of horse racing, greyhound racing and certain numbers draws, via satellite.
The statutory financial statements of SIS are prepared to the year ending 31 March.
The consolidated figures above are based on management accounts for the calendar year 2006.
A provision was made in 1999 against goodwill relating to the acquisition of shares in SIS to recognise impairment in the carrying value.
The following financial information relates to SIS: 26 December 27 December 2006 2005 m m Total assets 58.5 46.9 Total liabilities 32.8 28.8 Total revenue 144.9 126.9 Total profit after tax 16.3 13.2 William Hill Organization Limited also holds directly or indirectly 33% of the entire share capital of Lucky Choice Limited and of 49s Limited.
These companies were formed for the purpose of promoting and publicising certain numbers betting formats.
In the opinion of the directors, the results of these companies are not material to the results of the Group.
Consequently, the investments have been stated at cost and have not been accounted for under the equity method, which would normally be appropriate for an associated undertaking.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The first facility is for a total commitment of 1,200m, and is split into two tranches: Tranche A comprising a term loan of 600m repayable on 1 March 2010: and Tranche B comprising a revolving facility of 600m available until 1 March 2010.
The second facility agreement is for a term loan of 250m, which is repayable on 30 July 2011.
Mandatory repayments are required to be made under the terms of both sets of loan documentation, including, but not limited to, the net proceeds of certain asset sales.
The maturity profile above is analysed on the basis of calendar years from the balance sheet date.
The borrowings drawn down under the 1,200m facility agreement bear interest at a variable margin of between 0.4% and 0.75% above LIBOR, dependent on certain financial ratios.
The applicable margin at 26 December 2006 was 0.525%.
A commitment fee of 37.5% of the applicable margin is payable on the undrawn element of the revolving facility.
The revolving facility drawn down at 26 December 2006 was 295m 27 December 2005 420m.
The 250m borrowings under the second facility agreement bear interest at a fixed margin of 0.90% above LIBOR.
The facilities are secured by guarantees given by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
Overdraft facility At 26 December 2006, the Group had an overdraft facility with National Westminster Bank plc of 5.0m 27 December 2005 5.0m.
The balance of this facility at 26 December 2006 was nil 27 December 2005 nil.
Fair value of loans and facilities It is the directors opinion that due to the floating nature of the Groups borrowings and the proven cash generation capability of the Group, there is no significant difference between book and fair value of the Groups bank facilities and other borrowings.

Interest rate hedging arrangements The Group uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swap arrangements as at 26 December 2006 under which the LIBOR element of the interest payable is swapped for fixed rate payments.
The notional principal hedged under these swaps varies between 455m and 125m over the period to 31 December 2011.
At 26 December 2006 the notional principal hedged under these arrangements was 340m.
The fixed interest rate under the swaps varies from 4.4% to 5.35%.

The notional principal amount hedged under these arrangements varies between 440m and 125m.
At 26 December 2006 the notional principal amount under the Groups interest rate collars was 340m.
The fair value of swaps and collars entered into at 26 December 2006 is estimated as an asset of 14.4m 27 December 2005 liability 1.6m.
Derivative pricing models have been used to calculate these fair values.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 0.7m 52 weeks ended 27 December 2005 1.4m has been paid in respect of hedged interest payments made in the period.

Share-based payments The Group had the following share-based payment schemes in operation during the period, all of which will be settled by equity: a Performance Share Plan PSP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP encompassing awards made in the four years from 2003 to 2006: b Save As You Earn share option scheme involving options granted after 7 November 2002 SAYE encompassing grants made in the four years from 2003 to 2006: c Executive Director Incentive Plan EDIP : and d Save As You Earn share option schemes involving options granted before 7 November 2002 2002 SAYE encompassing a grant made in 2002.
Details of these schemes are provided on pages 18 and 19 in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In accordance with the transition provisions included in IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
In the context of the Groups schemes, this includes items a and b above.
The total expense recognised excluding employers National Insurance costs in respect of these schemes was 3.0m in the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2006 52 weeks ended 27 December 2005 2.2m.
a Performance Share Plan PSP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The PSP provides conditional awards of shares dependent equally on the Groups earnings per share growth and Total Shareholder Return TSR performance over a three-year period as well as continued employment of the individual at the date of vesting awards are usually forfeited if the employee leaves the Group voluntarily before the awards vest.
The LTIP provides conditional awards of shares dependent exclusively on the Groups TSR performance over a three-year period and continued employment of the individual at the date of vesting.
In the case of both plans, if the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the option lapses.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share awards exercised during the period was 5.86 52 weeks ended 27 December 2005 5.76.
The awards outstanding at 26 December 2006 had a remaining weighted average contractual life of 7.8 years 27 December 2005 8.5 years.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formula in respect of these awards were as follows: 26 December 27 December 2006 2005 Weighted average share price at date of grant 4.55 4.16 Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil Expected volatility 28% 29% Expected life 3.5 years 3.5 years Risk free interest rate 4.4% 4.4% Expected dividend yield 3.2% 3.3% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups shares over a period matching the option life where possible and where this is not possible due to the fact that the Company was only listed in June 2002, historical volatility has been calculated from a period commencing on 20 September 2002, being three months after the listing of the Company, and ending on the date of grant.
This ensures that the volatility calculation is not unduly affected by erratic price movements that arose immediately after flotation.
The expected life of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The value of the option has also been adjusted to take into account the market conditions applicable to the option i. e. TSR requirements by applying a discount to the option value.
This discount is calculated based on an estimate of the probability of achieving the relevant condition.
The weighted average fair value of the awards granted under the PSP and LTIP schemes at the date of grant was 2.29 per option 27 December 2005 2.02.
The expense recognised excluding employers national insurance costs in respect of relevant PSP and LTIP schemes in the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2006 was 1.9m 52 weeks ended 27 December 2005 1.1m.
b SAYE scheme for grants made in the four years from 2003 to 2006 Options under the SAYE Share Option Scheme, which is open to all eligible employees, are based on a three, five or seven year monthly savings contract.
Options under the scheme are granted with an exercise price up to 20% below the share price when the savings contract is entered into.
The options remain valid for six months beyond the end of the relevant savings contract.

The EDIP was an incentive arrangement for Messrs. Harding and Singer arising out of the flotation of the Group.
It was structured as a zero cost option.

Retirement benefit schemes continued Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a defined benefit scheme for eligible employees, which is now closed to new members.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 1.67% and 3.33% of final salary for each year of service on attainment of a retirement age of 63.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme and the contribution rate for future service benefits for 2006 was 19.2% of members pensionable pay.
In addition, during 2006 the Group made an additional contribution of 9.4m as the second annual payment of a five-year funding plan agreed with the Trustee to remove the funding deficit disclosed at the last formal actuarial valuation at 30 September 2004.
This funding plan will be reviewed following the next formal actuarial valuation, which is due as at 30 September 2007.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 30 September 2004 and updated to 26 December 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 26 December 27 December 2006 2005 Rate of increase of salaries 4.00% 3.75% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.00% 2.75% Discount rate 5.10% 4.90% Inflation rate 3.00% 2.75% The mortality assumption adopted for these calculations reflects an assumed life expectancy of 22.1 years for a male, currently aged 40, from age 63.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Notes to the reconciliation of equity a Software classification application software, which can be run independently from any specific hardware configuration, is typically included within other intangibles under IFRS rather than tangible assets as is the norm under UK GAAP.
The effect of this is to reclassify software of 14.2m 29 December 2004 14.8m from tangible assets to intangible assets.
Total net assets are not affected by this adjustment.
b Deferred tax associated with pension liabilities under IFRS deferred tax relating to the pension scheme cannot be netted off against the pension liability as it is under UK GAAP.
This has the effect of increasing the Groups deferred tax asset by 13.6m 29 December 2004 16.5m with a consequent increase in the net pension liability presented.
Net assets are not affected by this adjustment.
c Deferred tax offset due to more restrictive rules on the ability to offset deferred tax liabilities and assets, the deferred tax liabilities and assets are grossed up by 2.2m 29 December 2004 1.3m.
d Financial instruments all derivative instruments are required by IFRS to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value.
Under IFRS, hedge accounting for derivatives is only allowed where detailed documentation in accordance with IAS 39 is in place.
This allows the movements in fair values of the relevant derivative instrument but not the related borrowings to be recognised directly in reserves and therefore not impact earnings.
This issue will have no impact on the Groups earnings as acceptable hedge accounting documentation has been in place since 30 December 2003.
However the balance sheet does reflect a financial liability of 1.6m 29 December 2004 2.5m representing the fair value of the relevant derivatives, as well as a related deferred tax asset of 0.5m 29 December 2004 0.8m offset by corresponding entries in a new hedging reserve.
e Dividends under IFRS dividends payable may only be recorded as a liability of the Group when a legal or constructive liability has been incurred.
This is likely to be when the dividend proposed by the Board is made public on the announcement of the Groups results.
Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period to which they relate, even if only proposed after the period end.
This has the effect of increasing the net assets of the Group by the amount of the proposed dividend of 46.1m 29 December 2004 43.1m.
f Holiday pay it is accepted practice under IFRS to provide for pay for holidays to which staff are entitled but which they have not yet taken.
This has resulted in the recognition of an accrual for holiday pay of 1.9m, 0.4m of which arises from the Stanley acquisition and therefore affects goodwill calculation 29 December 2004 1.5m.
g Pensions a difference arises in the valuation of the pension scheme assets under IFRS, because pension assets must be valued using bid prices rather than using mid-market prices as is the convention under UK GAAP and there are also differences in measuring the value of life assurance schemes.
This results in an increase in the pension scheme liability of 3.9m 29 December 2004 0.3m and a consequent adjustment to deferred tax assets of 1.2m 29 December 2004 0.1m.
h Acquisitions the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that took place before 30 December 2003.
The Group has adopted IFRS 3 Business combinations in full for all acquisitions that have occurred after this date.
This has resulted in the recognition of additional intangible fixed assets of 452.8m 29 December 2004 3.9m and related deferred tax liabilities of 141.0m 29 December 2004 1.0m.
Under UK GAAP the intangible fixed assets would have been recognised in goodwill and the deferred tax liability would not have arisen.
i Deferred tax on properties acquired via business combinations under IFRS, a tax timing difference of 12.1m 29 December 2004 13.8m has been recognised in respect of properties previously acquired via acquisitions.

This is different from UK GAAP where revenue from Retail, Telephone and Interactive sportsbook including FOBTs, games on the online arcade and other numbers bets represents total amounts wagered by customers.
The effect of this change is to reduce both revenue and cost of sales by 9,940.8m.
This has no impact on operating profit.
b Associate profit under IFRS, the share of the associates result included in the Groups operating profit is after a charge for interest and tax.
These items were shown within the Groups interest and tax charges under UK GAAP.

c Tax charge the tax charge is 2.8m lower under IFRS compared to UK GAAP reflecting a combination of: 1.1m reduction arising from the different treatment of associate tax highlighted in b above: and 1.7m reduction reflecting a deferred tax movement on properties acquired via business combinations, which are ignored under UK GAAP but provided for under IFRS.
