Previously it had not been possible to foresee the utilisation of these losses prior to their expiry.
In addition, due to improved trading performance and revised strategic plans together with the expected utilisation of US net operating losses in the Pearson Government Solutions sale, the Group has re-evaluated the likely utilisation of operating losses both in the US and UK and as a consequence has increased the amount of the deferred tax asset carried forward in respect of such losses.
The combined effect of these two factors was to create a non-recurring tax benefit of 127m.
The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the UK tax rate as follows: All figures in millions 2006 2005 Profit before tax 466 446 Tax calculated at UK rate 140 134 Effect of overseas tax rates 19 20 Joint venture and associate income reported net of tax 7 5 Income not subject to tax 5 16 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 18 9 Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses 7 11 Recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses 136 Unutilised tax losses 3 3 Prior year adjustments 14 18 Total tax charge 11 116 UK 15 26 Overseas 4 90 Total tax charge 11 116 Add back: tax benefit on other gains and losses 4 4 Add back: tax benefit on amortisation of acquired intangibles 10 4 Add back: tax charge on other finance income 5 3 Recognition of tax losses 127 Adjusted income tax charge continuing operations 147 121 Adjusted income tax charge discontinued operations 8 7 Total adjusted income tax charge 155 128 Tax rate reflected in adjusted earnings 30.9% 30.3% The tax benefit charge on items charged to equity is as follows: All figures in millions 2006 2005 Deferred tax on share based payments 2 3 Deferred tax on net investment hedges 3 Deferred tax on actuarial gains and losses 9 Current tax on foreign exchange gains and losses 2 9 12 12 74 Pearson Governance and Financial Statements 2006 9 Earnings per share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive potential ordinary shares and adjusting the profit attributable, if applicable, to account for any tax consequences that might arise from conversion of those shares.
Adjusted In order to show results from operating activities on a comparable basis, an adjusted earnings per share is presented.
The following items are excluded in the calculation of adjusted earnings: Other gains and losses represent profits and losses on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other financial assets that are included within operating profit or represent the profit or loss on sale of a discontinued operation.
Such profits and losses are considered to distort the performance of the Group.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles is the amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.
The amortisation charge is not considered to be fully reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.
Other net finance income costs are foreign exchange and other gains and losses that represent short-term fluctuations in market value and foreign exchange movements on transactions and balances that are no longer in a hedge relationship.
These gains and losses are subject to significant volatility and may not be realised in due course as it is normally the intention to hold these instruments to maturity.
Other net finance costs of Group companies are included in finance costs or finance income as appropriate.
Other net finance costs of joint ventures and associates are included within the share of results of joint ventures and associates within operating profit.
Tax on the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
The Company has also excluded tax benefits from the recognition of its tax losses which due to their size and non-recurring nature are not considered to be fully reflective of the underlying tax rate of the Group.
Minority interest for the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
The Companys definition of adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill Impairment tests have been carried out where appropriate as described below.
The recoverable amount for each unit tested exceeds its carrying value.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units identified according to the business segment.
Goodwill has been allocated as follows: All figures in millions Notes 2006 2005 Higher Education 780 903 School Book 683 714 School Assessment and Testing 342 310 School Technology 356 408 Other Assessment and Testing 490 531 Other Government Solutions 249 Other Book 56 57 Pearson Education total 2,707 3,172 Penguin US 156 179 Penguin UK 114 114 Pearson Australia 44 47 Penguin total 314 340 IDC 149 138 Mergermarket 28 97 Other FT Publishing 4 4 FT Publishing total 101 4 Total goodwill continuing operations 3,271 3,654 Goodwill held for sale 29 221 Total goodwill 3,492 3,654 Goodwill has been allocated for impairment purposes to 13 cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is based on value in use calculations, with the exception of IDC which is assessed on a market value basis.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Following a review in 2006, the allocation of corporate items has been revised.
The 2005 comparative has been revised accordingly.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific cash-generating unit.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 10.3% to 11.9% for the Pearson Education businesses, 7.8% to 10.3% for the Penguin businesses and 10.5% to 11.0% for the FT Publishing businesses.
80 Pearson Governance and Financial Statements 2006 12 Intangible assets continued Perpetuity growth rates The cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period are based upon the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the cash-generating unit operates and reflect the long-term growth prospects of the sectors in which the cash-generating unit operates.
The perpetuity growth rates used vary between 2.5% and 3.5%.
The perpetuity growth rates are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flow growth rates The cash flow growth rates are derived from forecast sales growth taking into consideration past experience of operating margins achieved in the cash-generating unit.
Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably accurate.
The valuation of IDC is determined using an observable market price for each share.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.

Included within the losses to be utilised in 2007 are capital and operating losses of 93m which it is anticipated will be utilised on the sale of Pearson Government Solutions.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities may be offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2006 in respect of UK losses of 35m and has not recognised a deferred tax asset amounting to 47m on the net pension deficit on UK plans on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain that suitable future profits will arise against which to offset the liability.
None of these unrecognised deferred tax assets have expiry dates associated with them.
The recognition of the deferred tax assets is supported by managements forecasts of the future profitability of the relevant business units.

Fair values are determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
At the end of 2006, the currency split of the mark-to-market values of rate derivatives, including the exchange of principal on cross currency rate derivatives, was US dollar 247 m, euro 157m and sterling 157m 2005: US dollar 269 m, euro 166m and sterling 164m.
The fixed interest rates on outstanding rate derivative contracts at the end of 2006 range from 3.02% to 7.00% 2005: 3.02% to 7.23% and the floating rates are based on LIBOR in US dollar, sterling and euro EURIBOR.
The Groups portfolio of rate derivatives is diversified by maturity, counterparty and type.
Natural offsets between transactions within the portfolio and the designation of certain derivatives as hedges significantly reduce the risk of income statement volatility.
The following sensitivity analysis of derivative financial instruments to interest rate movements is based on the assumption of a 1% change in interest rates for all currencies and maturities, with all other variables held constant.

No single derivative transaction had a market value positive or negative at the balance sheet date that exceeded 3% of the Groups consolidated total equity.
At the year end the Group held an amount of 29m equivalent as collateral under a mark-to-market agreement.
This reflected the amount, at market rates prevailing at the end of October 2006, owed to the Group by a counterparty for a set of three related rate derivatives.
Under these derivatives the Group is due to exchange $209m for h204m at the beginning of February 2007, with the repayment of the h591m bond.
There are no restrictions on the Groups use of these funds, which have been recorded in borrowings as a current bank loan.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the Group has reviewed all of its material contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements, and has concluded that there are no material embedded derivatives.

92 Pearson Governance and Financial Statements 2006 24 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of retirement benefit plans throughout the world, the principal ones being in the UK and US.
The major plans are self-administered with the plans assets being held independently of the Group.
Retirement benefit costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The UK Group plan is a hybrid plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections but, predominantly, consisting of defined benefit liabilities.
There are a number of defined contribution plans, principally overseas.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the UK Group plan was completed as at 1 January 2006.
The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans.

In 1998, the Group introduced a Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
Under these plans, employees can save a portion of their monthly salary over periods of three, five or seven years.
At the end of this period, the employee has the option to purchase ordinary shares with the accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 80% of the market price prevailing at the time of the commencement of the employees participation in the plan.
Options that are not exercised within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary after grant lapse unconditionally.
98 Pearson Governance and Financial Statements 2006 24 Employee benefits continued Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Group established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows all employees in the US to save a portion of their monthly salary over six month periods.
At the end of the period, the employee has the option to purchase ADRs with their accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price prevailing at the beginning or end of the period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and renewed in 2006 and consists of two parts: share options and or restricted shares.
Options were granted under this plan in 2001 based on a pre-grant earnings per share growth test and are not subject to further performance conditions on exercise.
The options became exercisable in tranches and lapse if they remain unexercised at the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
The vesting of restricted shares is normally dependent on continuing service and or upon the satisfaction of corporate performance targets over a three-year period.
These targets may be based on market and or nonmarket performance criteria.
Restricted shares awarded to senior management in October 2006 vest dependent on relative shareholder return, return on invested capital and a combination of earnings per share growth.
The award was split equally across all three measures.
Other restricted shares awarded in 2006 vest depending on continuing service over a three-year period.
Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan This plan permits executive directors and senior executives around the Group to invest up to 50% of any after tax annual bonus in Pearson shares.
If these shares are held more than three years and the Group meets an earnings per share growth target, the Company will match them on a gross basis of up to one share for every one held after five years.
In addition to the above, share options remain outstanding under Executive Share Option, Reward and Special Share Option Plans.
These are legacy plans which were replaced with the introduction of the Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2001.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options granted under the Groups plans are as follows: 2006 2005 2006 Weighted 2005 Weighted Number of average Number of average share exercise share exercise options price options price 000s 000s Outstanding at beginning of year 21,677 13.15 26,179 13.62 Granted during the year 837 6.30 606 4.92 Exercised during the year 1,396 5.36 324 6.01 Forfeited during the year 1,828 15.39 4,352 15.75 Expired during the year 429 6.72 432 9.17 Outstanding at end of year 18,861 13.36 21,677 13.15 Options exercisable at end of year 15,595 14.14 17,420 13.90 Options were exercised regularly throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 7.45 2005: 6.52.
Early exercises arising from redundancy, retirement or death are treated as an acceleration of vesting and the Group therefore recognises in the income statement the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the original vesting period.
99 Pearson Governance and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 24 Employee benefits continued The options outstanding at the end of the year have weighted average remaining contractual lives and exercise prices as follows: 2006 2005 2006 Weighted 2005 Weighted Number of average Number of average share contractual share contractual Range of exercise prices options life options life 000s Years 000s Years 0 5 1,649 1.94 2,773 2.32 5 10 5,254 3.85 5,555 4.57 10 15 7,638 3.63 8,237 4.64 15 20 1,050 2.88 1,168 3.81 20 25 424 3.19 930 3.80 25 2,846 3.22 3,014 4.22 18,861 3.42 21,677 4.19 In 2006 and 2005 options were granted under the Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
The weighted average estimated fair value for the options granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The weighted average estimated fair values and the inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average average Fair value 1.92 2.41 Weighted average share price 7.66 6.54 Weighted average exercise price 6.30 5.08 Expected volatility 23.12% 35.47% Expected life 4.0 years 4.1 years Risk free rate 4.42% 4.48% Expected dividend yield 3.52% 3.93% Forfeiture rate 5.0% 6.3% The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the Companys share price over the previous three to seven years depending on the vesting term of the options.

From 2006 onwards, participants of the Long-Term Incentive Plan are entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
Following a review of the accounting policies for share-based payments in 2006, the restricted shares granted in 2006 under the Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan are valued using the share price at the date of grant discounted by the dividend yield 3.66% to take into account any dividends foregone.
The fair value of shares granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan that vest unconditionally was determined using the share price at the date of grant.
The number of shares to vest was adjusted based on historical experience to account for any potential forfeitures.
Restricted shares with a market performance condition were valued by an independent actuary using a Monte Carlo model.
Restricted shares with a nonmarket performance condition were fair valued based on the share price at the date of grant.
Non-market performance conditions were considered by adjusting the number of shares expected to vest based on the most likely outcome of the relevant performance criteria.
Subsidiary share option plans IDC, a 62% subsidiary of the Group, operates the following share-based payment plans: 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2001, IDC adopted the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for all eligible employees worldwide.
The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows employees to purchase stock at a discounted price at specific times.
2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan Under this plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors can grant share-based awards representing up to 20% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at the date of grant.
The plan provides for the discretionary issuance of share-based awards to directors, officers and employees of IDC, as well as persons who provide consulting or other services to IDC.
The exercise price for all options granted to date has been equal to the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.
Options expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a three to four year period without any performance criteria attached.
In addition, grants of restricted stock can be made to certain executives and members of the Board of Directors of IDC.
