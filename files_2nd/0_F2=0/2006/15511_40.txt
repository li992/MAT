C. 1972 Plan the UK Pension Plan and the Company agreed that in addition to the cash contribution of 185 million made to the UK Pension Plan shortly before the return of cash to shareholders the Company should pay 490 million into an escrow arrangement for the potential benefit of the UK Pension Plan.
The cash contributed to this escrow arrangement will be held by a nominee on trust for the benefit of the Company, but with security over such amount being provided to the Trustees.
An escrow deposit of 20 million was put in place following the High Court approval of the release of the capital reduction reserve a non-distributable reserve on 11 October 2005.
This was reduced to 16 million in March 2006 due to the extinguishment or payment of claims by the Company totalling 3.7 million and the release of interest earned on the deposit.
