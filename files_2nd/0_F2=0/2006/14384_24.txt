The balance sheet includes the surplus deficit in schemes taking assets at their year-end market values and liabilities at their actuarially calculated values discounted at year-end AA corporate bond interest rates.
Amounts charged in respect of defined contribution schemes are the contributions payable in the year.
Share-based Payment The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares or share options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example profitability and sales growth targets.
Fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Binomial models.
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied only to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Events after the balance sheet date The ASB issued FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date in May 2004.
This standard replaced SSAP 17 Accounting for Post Balance Sheet Events and the main effect of this change is to prohibit the recording of a provision for a proposed dividend where the dividend is declared after the balance sheet date.
FRS 21 is applicable for accounting periods beginning on after 1 January 2005.
Therefore final dividends are now only recognised when shareholders have approved such amount and interim dividends are only recognised when paid.

7 Post-retirement benefits The Company operates three defined benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
This funded scheme was transferred to the Company during the period and at the same time, two other schemes were merged into it.
In 2005 the Company was one of many employers in a UK pension scheme and accounted for pensions as defined contributions in accordance with FRS 17.
During 2006, the Company became the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for pensions as defined benefits, in accordance with FRS 17.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Company accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, principally post-retirement healthcare, in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2006.
This has been rolled forward to 5 August 2006.
Contributions to the funded scheme are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2006 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8% 3.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.7% 2.5% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.8% 2.4% Discount rate 5.3% 5.0% Inflation rate 2.8% 2.4% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used in the UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme and the assumptions also allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member who retires in 2013 at age 65 will live on average for a further 21 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years after retirement if they are female.
106 Smiths Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the Company accounts continued 7 Post-retirement benefits continued The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 5 August 2006 were: 2006 2005 UK schemes UK schemes Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m Equities 8.0% 905.8 Government bonds 4.9% 54.8 Corporate bonds 5.3% 188.2 Property 7.0% 161.8 Other 4.8% 69.8 Total market value 1,380.4 Present value of funded pension scheme liabilities 1,415.2 Surplus deficit 34.8 Unfunded pension plans 31.9 20.9 Post-retirement healthcare 17.0 17.4 83.7 38.3 Related deferred tax asset 32.9 12.1 Net pension liability 50.8 26.2 In 2005 the deferred tax asset was held in debtors greater than one year on the balance sheet.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

His contribution to Smiths has been immense Chairman and is fully recognised by the very high regard in which he is held by his colleagues.
4 Smiths Group plc Summary financial statement 2006 Chief Executives statement For the second year running, Smiths has achieved double Sales digit growth rates, with sales increasing 17% and headline operating profit up 25%.
In each of the last two years operating profit rose faster than sales.
The headline operating margin on sales improved by a full percentage point to 14.8%.
It is important that this growth was achieved right across Smiths.
In 2006 each division grew sales by 10% or more, and, taking the last two years together, each grew sales by 20% or more.
Our growth is equally divided between acquisitive and 3,523m organic growth, and it is gratifying that organic growth is accelerating from 8% in 2005 to 9% in 2006.
Keith Butler-Wheelhouse Recognising continued deterioration in the automotive Headline Chief Executive component market, particularly in the US, an impairment pre-tax profit review of the preference share investment in TI Automotive has been undertaken.
As a result, Smiths has decided to write down the carrying value of the investment in the TI Automotive preference shares from 325m to nil value in the accounts.
There is no cash impact from this decision.
22% I am pleased that this year we have converted some 81% of headline operating profit into cash despite making significant 492m investment in the business.
One vital aspect of my job is visiting Smiths facilities around the world.
What unifies all our 250 plus locations, whether Statutory new or long established, is the quality of the people who work pre-tax profit there.
I would like to thank each and every Smiths person for their dedication and achievements over the past year.
Driving for Full Potential Last year I outlined Smiths six fundamental strengths.
Our strengths help us shape the Company, defining our markets, creating opportunities and growing from our core businesses.
They are the basis of our Full Potential 132m programme, introduced three years ago to grow sales and enhance profitability.
Full Potential is not an abstract concept at Smiths.
People in every part of our business are taking action to achieve the best possible long-term performance for shareholders, with targets based on first-class execution of our plans against realistic expectations for their markets.
Here, in the context of our six strengths, I will provide a snapshot of some past and present examples of actions we have taken to deliver continuing high levels of growth.

The Remuneration Committee has approved arrangements under which Mr Butler-Wheelhouse and Mr Thomson have waived entitlements to certain of their emoluments in return for unfunded unapproved pension benefits of equivalent value granted by the Company.
The arrangements for Mr Butler-Wheelhouse were described in last years report.
Those for Mr Thomson which are separate from the arrangements described in note 3 were approved with effect from December 2005.
In accordance with relevant legislation, the value of these unfunded unapproved pension benefits was converted into funded benefits under the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS in April 2006.
The unfunded benefits notionally accrued a bond-like return prior to the conversion in April 2006.
In connection with these arrangements Mr Butler-Wheelhouse waived 237,884 in addition to 32,473 waived in connection with earlier arrangements and Mr Thomson waived 120,000 during the period 1 August 2005 to 31 March 2006.
From April 2006 Mr Butler-Wheelhouse and Mr Thomson continued to waive their entitlements to certain of their emoluments in return for the Company making equivalent amounts of contributions to SIPS: Mr Butler-Wheelhouse waived 71,664 and Mr Thomson 56,461.
The amounts waived would otherwise have been paid to Mr Butler-Wheelhouse as payments in lieu of pension contributions and to Mr Thomson as salary.
For reasons of clarity, all amounts referred to are included within the table above.
From October 2005 UK employees ceased making personal contributions to the relevant pension schemes.
Their salaries were reduced by the amount of their previous pension contributions and the Company commenced paying the same amount directly to the pension schemes.
Accordingly, the salaries of Messrs Thomson, Langston and Lillycrop were reduced by 26,969, 6,675 and 6,675 respectively.
For reasons of clarity, the salaries shown in the table above for these directors are the amounts they would have been paid if they had not given up these salary entitlements.

From October 2005, in common with other UK employees participating in the relevant pension schemes, these directors ceased making personal contributions.
Their salaries were reduced by an amount equal to their previous pension contributions and the Company commenced paying the same amount directly to the pension schemes.
The benefits provided under the relevant pension schemes were not affected by this change.
Separately, as described in note 2 on page 18, additional pension benefits were provided to Mr Thomson following his waiver of a further 176,461 of salary.
Transfer values of the accrued benefits have been calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance GN11, and represent the amount that the pension scheme would pay to another pension provider if the member elects to transfer all of his benefits out of the scheme.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to the individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of predetermined damages in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances.
