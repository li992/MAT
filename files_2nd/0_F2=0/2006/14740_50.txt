EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS Continued In addition to this, surpluses or deficits on the Groups schemes are reported gross on the face of the Balance Sheet rather than net of deferred tax, as is the practice under UK GAAP.
vi Intangible assets Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets, the Group has reclassified the software licence and development costs incurred since 1 April 2000, which had been expensed under UK GAAP, as Intangible Assets.
The Groups policy for amortisation of these assets is to amortise these over a period of 5 years.
As a result, net assets at 31 March 2005 have been increased by 4.5m.
The Group has revised its method of recording the assets and liabilities created under the Renewable Obligations Certificates ROCs scheme.
Self-generated ROCs are recorded at market value and purchased ROCs are recognised at cost within intangible assets.
The liability under the renewables obligation is recognised based on electricity supplied to customers, the percentages set by the regulator and the prevailing market price.
The impact of this change is to increase both intangible assets and current liabilities by 94.0m at 31 March 2005.
The accoounting for the underlying transaction remains unaffected by this disclosure change.
vii Business combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Under adopted IFRS, this is prohibited by IFRS 3 Business Combinations which instead requires an annual impairment review in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to be carried out.
At the transition date of 1 April 2004, the net balance of goodwill recognised under UK GAAP has been carried forward.
This balance will thereafter be subject to an impairment review which will be carried out on at least an annual basis.
The goodwill amortisation charge under UK GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2005 of 15.4m, has been reversed in the Income Statement.
In addition to this, the acquisition accounting methodology for the purchase of Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge has been reassessed under IFRS 3.
This has had the effect of increasing the deferred tax provision required by 17.7m and, consequently, creating goodwill on acquisition of the same amount.
viii Associates and jointly controlled entities Under UK GAAP, the Groups share of the operating profit, interest and taxation of associates and jointly controlled entities have been reported separately on the face of the profit and loss account.
Under adopted IFRS, the Groups share of profit after tax for its associates and jointly controlled entities is reported as a single line item within operating profit.
To aid comparison and understanding of the Groups results, the Group discloses such additional information required to allow continued reporting of operating profit inclusive of the operating profit from associates and jointly controlled entities.
In addition to this, an adjustment in relation to deferred taxation under IAS 12 requires a 0.4m reduction to the opening carrying value of investments in jointly controlled entities.
ix Other accounting policies All other accounting policies which have not been specifically disclosed in this document have not changed significantly from previous policies under UK GAAP.
Company The adopted IFRS policies of the Company are identical to those of the Group, where applicable.
The income statement profit for the year to 31 March 2005 can be reconciled as follows: Income Statement m UK GAAP profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 March 2005 297.4 Add less : Internal dividends received in cash from prior year 79.5 Internal dividends accrued not received 257.8 Adopted IFRS profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 March 2005 119.1 34.
IAS 39 AND IAS 32: NOTES TO THE CONVERSION In accordance with IFRS 1, the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 and the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 have not been restated to reflect the adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32.
The principal effect of the adoption of these standards at 1 April 2005 is to record certain derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Operating derivatives IAS 39 does not apply to commodity contracts that are held for the Groups own use requirements, although the definition of own use is narrow.
Such contracts continue to be accounted for under accruals accounting.
Outwith the exemption for own use contracts, all derivatives must be recognised at fair value with changes in value being recognised in the income statement, with the exception of contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.
Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2006 Notes on the Financial Statements Continued 100 for the year ended 31 March 2006 34.
IAS 39 AND IAS 32: NOTES TO THE CONVERSION Continued Under cash flow hedge accounting, movements on the effective portion of the hedge are recognised through a special hedge reserve, while any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement.
The impact of this is to minimise the impact of fair value movements to the income statement and, hence, reduce potential volatility.
The fair values applied to the contracts which require to be so treated are based on forward price curves generated from a combination of published market data and, for periods where such data is not available, internal valuation techniques.
The values attributed to the balance sheet are based on the present value of the differences between contract prices and these forward curves.
The financial impact of this approach before associated deferred tax has been to increase opening net assets at 1 April 2005 by 130.1m, comprising 49.2m credited to the hedge reserve and 80.9m credited to retained earnings.
Financing derivatives IAS 39 also applies to the treatment of the Groups loans, borrowings and derivatives.
Under IAS 39, loans and borrowings are carried at amortised cost.
However, derivatives are recognised separately on the balance sheet at fair value with movements in those fair values being reflected through the income statement.
Qualifying interest rate derivatives are accounted for under cash flow hedging rules, as described above, or under fair value hedge accounting rules.
Fair value hedge accounting requires both the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument to be recognised on the balance sheet, with movements on both being recognised through the income statement.
Furthermore, certain foreign exchange transactions are accounted for under the cash flow hedge accounting rules previously described.
The financial impact of this approach before associated deferred tax has been to reduce opening net assets at 1 April 2005 by 43.6m, comprising 23.0m debited to the hedge reserve and 20.6m debited to retained earnings.
Convertible debt Under UK GAAP, the Groups convertible debt was accounted for as part of net debt and was shown as a liability on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 32, this compound instrument is required to be split into its debt and equity elements, with the debt element being measured at fair value at inception.
This will increase interest charged to the income statement over the term of the debt and has the impact of increasing net assets, by reducing borrowings, and increasing shareholders equity, by 14.6m at 1 April 2005.
Scotia Gas Networks The impact of the Groups share of the contingent interest rate swap held by Scotia Gas Networks plc, of which the Group owns 50%, has been recognised at 1 April 2005.
The purchase by Scotia Gas Networks plc of gas networks in Scotland and the south of England from National Grid Transco completed at 1 June 2005.
However, at 1 April 2005 the acquisition of the operating companies remained contingent on final approval by Ofgem and the Health and Safety Executive.
As a result, at that date, the interest rate swap was contingent on the success of the consortiums proposed purchase.
The Groups share of this contingent swap was 54.7m out of the money before tax at the date of conversion.
The swap does not qualify for hedge accounting and must therefore be marked to market through the income statement.
Summary The impact of these adjustments to the balance sheet at 1 April 2005 can be summarised as follows: At 1 April 2005 Operating Financing Scotia Gas Convertible Derivatives Derivatives Networks Debt Total m m m m m IAS 39 asset liability 130.1 43.6 54.7 31.8 Deferred tax liability asset 39.1 13.1 16.4 6.2 15.8 Borrowings 20.8 20.8 Total net assets liability 91.0 30.5 38.3 14.6 36.8 Fair value deferred in hedge reserves 34.4 16.1 18.3 Fair value deferred in retained earnings 56.6 14.4 38.3 3.9 Shareholders equity 14.6 14.6 Shareholders funds 91.0 30.5 38.3 14.6 36.8
