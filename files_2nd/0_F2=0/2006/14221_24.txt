INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONTINUED The total tax charge for the year is lower 2005: higher than that resulting from applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK: 30% 2005: 30%.
The differences are explained in the following reconciliation: 2006 2006 2005 2005 000s % 000s % Profit on ordinary activities before tax continuing operations 102,672 83,815 Profit on ordinary activities before tax discontinued operation 3,774 2,996 Profit on disposal of discontinued operation 1,947 108,393 86,811 Tax at 30% thereon 32,518 30.0% 26,043 30.0% Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year: permanent items 1,868 1.7% 2,885 3.3% profit on sale of discontinued operation 676 0.6% losses not previously recognised in deferred tax 121 0.1% 26 adjustments in respect of previous years 2,562 2.4% 1,264 1.5% effect of overseas tax rates 844 0.8% 1,031 1.2% Total income tax expense for the year 31,871 29.4% 28,669 33.0% Effective tax rate: tax on continuing operations excluding goodwill impairment losses 30,839 30.0% 27,835 31.1% The effective tax charge for the Group is 30.0% 2005: 31.1%.
The following factors that will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the UK corporate tax rate 30% and overseas: in particular, France Germany corporate tax rates substantially more than 30% and Ireland Poland corporate tax rates substantially less than 30%.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of permanent disallowables: and agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities.
The Group has taken account of the majority of its trading losses in its deferred tax balance.
Although tax losses can be used to reduce cash payments of tax, utilisation of such losses would result in a deferred tax charge in that year which would eliminate any profit and loss benefit.
In addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been credited charged directly to equity and are shown in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and Note 23: 2006 2005 000s 000s Deferred tax movement associated with actuarial gain loss 966 563 Current and deferred tax on share options 2,214 596 Tax charge on exchange difference arising on borrowings and derivative financial instruments 1,078 639 Transitional adjustment to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005 3,869 170 4,389 7.

Options have been granted to scheme participants at 80% of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken approximately one month prior to the official grant date.
Similar arrangements have existed since 17 May 2002 in Ireland.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
These options may be exercised within a fixed six month period three or five years from the date of grant.
No SAYE options have been granted in the UK in 2005 or 2006.
Instead, the Company has issued share options in the second half of 2005 and in 2006 under a Share Investment Plan SIP as approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting see page 74.

b Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS Under the existing ESOS for which the last options were granted in 2003, Executives can be awarded an annual grant of share options at market price, provided that the total amount payable by the individual to exercise options under the ESOS or any other share option scheme of the Group excluding savings related schemes granted during the immediately preceding ten years does not exceed four times base salary, bonus and benefits.
Share options under the ESOS are exercisable between three and ten years for the Inland Revenue approved scheme and three and seven years for the unapproved scheme from the date of grant.
The award would vest in full if, over a consecutive three year period, the growth in the Groups earnings per share EPS is 6% higher than the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index.
None of the award would vest if the growth in EPS is less than 6% above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the existing LTIP policy, Executives can be awarded an annual grant of nil paid share options up to a maximum value of 70% of base salary.
2003 LTIP criteria Awards under the 2003 LTIP are exercisable between three and seven years from the date of grant.
Provided the individuals performance criteria are met the award vests if, over a consecutive three year period, the growth in the Groups EPS is 10% higher than the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index.
None of the award vests if the growth in EPS is less than 6% above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
Between these two limits, the awards vest proportionately.
The right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Board.
If the 6% minimum growth performance target is not met, the performance period is extended by one year and the minimum growth in the Groups EPS, over a consecutive four year period, is increased to 8% over the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED d Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS Options were granted under the DABS scheme for the first time in 2005.
The DABS operates by inviting participants including Executive Directors to use up to 50% of their annual performance related cash bonus after tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year to purchase shares in the Company.
Providing certain criteria are met, participants purchasing such shares will be eligible to receive nil cost matching shares up to a maximum of one per share purchased by the participant.
The criteria are as follows: Percentage of award vesting Percentage growth in the Companys EPS over the three year period from the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period by: less than 3% per annum compounded None of the award vests 3% per annum compounded 50% of award vests between 3% and 5% per annum compounded Award vests proportionately between 50% and 100% 5% per annum compounded 100% of award vests DABS issued after 7 November 2002 as at 31 December 2006 Options Outstanding at beginning of the year 17,520 Granted during the year 17,262 Lapsed during the year Exercised during the year Granted and outstanding at the end of the year 34,782 None of the above share options outstanding at the end of the year are exercisable at 31 December 2006.
All DABS are nil paid options and therefore the options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of nilp, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.8 years.
The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are as follows: Shares granted in 2005 2006 Share price on date of official grant 601p 898p 19 April 2005 13 April 2006 Exercise price of matching shares 0p 0p Expected volatility 29.8% 13.1% Actual life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 4.5% 4.5% Dividend 14.0p 16.8p Expected percentage options exercised versus granted 100% 100% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
e Share Incentive Plan SIP Shares were granted under the SIP scheme for the first time in 2005.
The SIP is a HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants including Executive Directors to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
No performance criteria is attached to these matching shares other than to avoid forfeiture they must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2006, 50,547 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the following years operating budget approved by the Directors and an appropriate projection of cash flows based upon industry expectations for up to five years.
After this period, the growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 2% and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre tax rates and ranged between 11.7% and 13.2%.
In 2005, the Group recognised a goodwill impairment loss of 5.654m on its Screenbase division, therefore writing the goodwill attributable to this business to nil net book value.
Further details on this impairment loss can be found in the Groups 2005 Annual Report and Accounts.
There have been no instances of goodwill impairment noted from the annual impairment tests performed in 2006.
The carrying amount of goodwill of 216.257m has been allocated across multiple CGUs.
Individual amounts of goodwill allocated to a CGU that are significant in comparison to the overall carrying amount of goodwill are as follows: 2006 000s UK Insulation 34,826 UK Roofing and Building Plastics 64,483 UK Specialist Construction Products 28,930 LS Group 13,251 Ireland 34,758 Poland 8,277 German Roofing 5,345 189,870 In addition, the Group has an indefinite life intangible asset LS Group brand of 12.646m.
Further details of impairment reviews performed on this asset are provided in Note 12.
76 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 1 SIG ar06 back.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS The intangible assets presented below relate entirely to acquired intangibles.
These arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of acquired intangibles from goodwill.
As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2004.
During 2005 and 2006, the Group owned purchased intangible assets with an insignificant book value mainly software separable from any associated hardware and these have not been reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the grounds of materiality.
The weighted average amortisation period for each category of intangible asset is disclosed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on page 60.
In the opinion of the Directors, the only intangible asset which has an indefinite useful life is the brand attributable to the acquisition of LS Group Limited.
The carrying value of the LS brand at the balance sheet date is 12.646m.
An indefinite useful life has been determined for the LS brand on the basis that it is expected to be maintained indefinitely and is expected to continue to drive value for the Group.
The recoverable value of the brand is based upon value in use calculations.
Further information on value in use calculations is provided within Note 11.
The Directors have used past experience in determining each of the key assumptions in the value in use calculation for the LS brand.
The growth rates assumed are in line with industry expectations and, for periods beyond those covered by its management forecasts, do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The discount rate applied is 11.7%, equivalent to its pre tax weighted average cost of capital.

Due to the proximity of the timing of a number of the acquisitions close to the year end, the Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2007.
The fair value adjustments above relate primarily to: the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their market value: the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group: and an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Groups policies.
Included within goodwill are staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition by the relevant accounting standards.
The pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit for Melle, which was acquired on 21 July 2006, for the seven months ended 21 July 2006 amounted to 37.716m and 0.462m respectively.
The 2006 Consolidated Income Statement includes the following amounts in respect of Melle: revenue 46.185m, cost of sales 37.081m and operating expenses 6.235m giving an operating profit of 2.869m.
The Directors estimate the pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the other acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2006 to the respective acquisition dates amounted to 109.200m and 9.300m respectively.
The 2006 Consolidated Income Statement includes the following amounts in respect of the other acquisitions: revenue 46.965m, cost of sales 33.817m and operating expenses 11.312m giving an operating profit of 1.836m.
Revenue and operating profit for the year ending 31 December 2006 for all 2006 acquisitions amounted to 240.066m and 14.467m respectively.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables for which an allowance has been made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Treasury risk management section of the Business Review on pages 22 and 23 provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The Groups financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, cash at bank and derivative financial instruments.

All of these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 29 December 2006 at market rates and therefore their fair value is deemed to equate to their book value of nil.
The expiry date of these derivative financial instruments is 31 December 2007.
The Directors consider the fair value of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities to approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Groups private placement notes approximates to the amount in the value of the financial liabilities above.
40.000m of the Sterling Other borrowings relates to debt on which the Group has taken out interest rate derivative financial instruments to fix the interest rate and the debt is already carried at approximately its fair value in the table above.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to 8.610m and relates to finance lease contracts and fixed rate loans.
The Directors consider the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to approximate to the book values shown above.

All of these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 30 December 2005 at market rates and therefore, at 31 December 2005, their fair value was deemed to equate to their book value of nil.
The expiry date of these derivative financial instruments was 29 December 2006.
In both 2006 and 2005, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to UK LIBOR in the case of Sterling liabilities, EURIBOR for Euro liabilities, WIBOR for Polish Zloty liabilities and US prime rate and US LIBOR for US Dollar liabilities.
Transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement are minimal as Group companies do not enter into significant amounts of cross border transactions.
The amount arising in the Group during 2006 in respect of transactional exposures amounted to a gain of 179,000 2005: 132,000.
Hedging relationships The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as hedge ineffectiveness in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled other items.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
a Net investment hedges As at 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into four cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which form a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated trading assets.
At 31 December 2006, these four derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 8.583m 31 December 2005: 11.434m.
Of this fair value movement, 1.357m has been recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement as hedge ineffectiveness and 1.494m has been recognised directly in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
b Cash flow hedges With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into seven cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into variable Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
At 31 December 2006, these eight derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 29.291m 31 December 2005: 16.650m.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At 31 December 2006, the average maturity date of the these swaps is 8.0 years 2005: 3.8 years.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into two interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap variable rate Sterling debt into fixed rate Sterling debt thereby fixing the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
At 31 December 2006, these two derivative financial instruments had a fair value asset of 0.684m 31 December 2005: liability of 0.292m.
Both of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At 31 December 2006, the average maturity date of the these swaps is 2.6 years 2005: 3.6 years.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Hedging relationships continued b Cash flow hedges continued As at 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into three cross-currency derivative financial instruments which swap fixed Sterling denominated debt into fixed Euro denominated debt.
The movement in fair value of these derivative financial instruments hedges the post tax Euro cash flows of the Group and thereby fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
As these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 29 December 2006 at market rates prevailing at that date, the fair value of these derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2006 was nil.
At 31 December 2006, the average maturity date of the these swaps is one year 2005: one year.
c Fair value hedges As set out in Note 27c, on 1 November 2006, the Group raised additional funds through the issue of private placement notes.
The transaction was split into two drawdowns on 1 November 2006 and 1 February 2007.
On 1 November 2006, the Group entered into three derivative financial instruments which hedged the interest rate exposure on the debt being drawn down on 1 February 2007.
As at 31 December 2006, the fair value liability of these derivative financial instruments was 0.469m.
As these hedges are fully effective fair value hedges of a firm commitment, the movement in fair value has been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
This movement is exactly offset by the movement in the firm commitment being hedged which has also been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The overall impact on the Consolidated Income Statement is therefore nil.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2006 was as follows: 2006 2005 000s 000s In one year or less 56,082 101,368 In more than one year but not more than two years 1,605 654 In more than two years but not more than five years 97,976 40,850 In more than five years 137,272 63,971 Total 292,935 206,843 Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2006 as follows: 2006 2005 000s 000s Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 50,019 13 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 63,495 59,919 Expiring in more than five years 424 398 Total 113,938 60,330 In addition, as detailed in Note 27c, the Group is committed to borrowing a further 40m and 60m as part of the private placement notes entered into on 1 November 2006.
These facilities have not been included in the undrawn facilities noted above.

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Onerous leases The Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts where a period of vacancy is ongoing.
The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub lease agreements on a contract by contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 27b.
Leasehold dilapidations This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties into their original state of repair at the end of the lease.
The provision is calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 27b.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of current and prior year acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are met.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made within two years.
Other amounts Other amounts relate principally to claim provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and three years.
DEFERRED TAX The net deferred tax liability asset at the end of the year is analysed as follows: 2006 2005 000s 000s Deferred tax assets 16,435 21,085 Deferred tax liabilities 17,764 7,507 Net deferred tax liability asset 1,329 13,578 The net deferred tax liability asset is made up of the following elements: 2006 2005 000s 000s Deferred tax analysis: Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 1,064 38 Short term timing differences 7,789 3,788 Losses 871 1,769 On retirement benefit obligations 6,653 8,059 Net deferred tax liability asset 1,329 13,578 The movement during the year in the net deferred tax asset liability was as follows: Beginning of year 13,578 14,840 IFRS transitional adjustment at 1 January 2005 3,869 On acquisition of subsidiaries 13,165 7,823 Charge credit for the year 387 1,477 Exchange differences 66 56 On retirement benefit obligations 966 563 Deferred tax on share options 323 596 End of year 1,329 13,578 Given current trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries with a lower rate of corporation tax than that suffered in the UK, for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised, was 40.568m 2005: 29.396m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY CONTINUED The special reserve arises as a result of a number of transfers from the Groups share premium reserve up until 1996.
Goodwill arising on a number of historic acquisitions was then written off against this special reserve.
The cumulative amount of goodwill resulting from acquisitions in earlier years which has been written off directly against reserves, net of goodwill relating to undertakings disposed of, is 131.431m 2005: 131.431m.
The share option reserve represents the cumulative share option charge under IFRS 2 less the value of any share options that have been exercised.
The hedging and translation reserve represents movements in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of movements in exchange rates which are taken directly to reserves as detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on pages 59 to 62.

The transaction was split into two drawdowns.
On 1 November 2006, the Group received 110m and 40m of these funds.
As part of the private placement contract, the Group is committed to drawing down a further 40m and 60m on 1 February 2007. d Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes, six 2005: six of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, four 2005: four have assets held in separate trustee administered funds and two 2005: two are overseas book reserved schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes all of which are independently managed.
The defined benefit schemes are herein after referred to as the main scheme and other schemes, being five smaller schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 which was issued on 16 December 2004, the Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The main actuarial assumptions in the pension assessments were that over the long term the annual investment return would be 2% higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries, and after retirement 2.5% higher than the annual price inflation-linked increase in pensions.
The last formal actuarial valuations of three of the defined benefit schemes including the main scheme were conducted at 1 January 2004 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 29.7m, 7.8m and 1.9m and their actuarial values covered 64%, 94% and 70% respectively of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the fourth defined benefit scheme was at 6 April 2004 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1.2m and its actuarial value covered 60% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The fifth and sixth schemes are book reserved schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
Consolidated Income Statement charges The pension charge for the year relating to the main scheme was 2.126m 2005: 1.983m, 0.802m 2005: 0.852m in relation to other schemes and was 3.948m 2005: 2.839m in relation to defined contribution schemes.
In accordance with IAS 19 Retirement Benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2006 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The four UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, have an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The two overseas book reserved schemes remain open to new members.
