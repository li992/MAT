For the purposes of measuring operating profit, investment returns on shareholder-financed business are based on expected long-term rates of return.
The expected long-term rates of return are intended to reflect historical real rates of return and, where appropriate, current inflation expectations adjusted for consensus economic and investment forecasts.
The significant operations that require adjustment for the difference between actual and long-term investment returns are Jackson and certain businesses of the Groups Asian operations.
The amounts included in operating results for long-term capital returns for debt securities comprise two components.
These are a risk margin reserve based charge for expected defaults, which is determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio, and amortisation of interest-related gains and losses for operating results based on longer-term results to the date when sold bonds would I otherwise have matured.
ii Effect of changes to assumptions, estimates and bases of determining life assurance liabilities The results of the Groups long-term business operations are affected by changes of assumptions and bases of preparation.
These are described in notes D2 f, D3 f and D4 f. In particular, the operating result for UK insurance operations for 2006 has benefited from a credit of 46 million due to altered regulatory requirements, as explained in note D2 f, whilst the operating result for Asian long-term business in 2005 benefited by a net of 52 million for changes in Singapore and Taiwan as described in note D4 f. iii Jackson Summary of operating results a IFRS basis operating profits include the following longer-term investment returns net of related change in amortisation of deferred acquisition costs 2006 2005 m m Longer-term returns on debt securities: Amortisation of interest-related gains net of related change in amortisation of deferred acquisition costs 38 46 Risk margin reserve charge in respect of credit-related losses net of related change in amortisation of deferred acquisition costs note b 44 45 Total 6 1 Longer-term returns on equity type investments 45 38 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 125 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued B1: Supplementary analysis of profit from continuing operations before tax attributable to shareholders continued Notes continued b The risk margin reserve RMR charge for 2006 is based on an average annual RMR of 23 basis points 2005: 24 basis points on a book value of US$43.9bn 2005: US$43.3bn iv Asian fund management business Operating profit for the Asian fund management business of 12 million for 2005 was determined after an exceptional cost of 16 million incurred in Taiwan due to bond fund A restructuring required as a result of industry-wide regulatory change.
v Goodwill impairment charge The charge for goodwill impairment of 120 million in 2005 related to the Japan life business.
There was no impairment charge for goodwill in 2006.
Further details of the Groups goodwill are shown in notes H1 and H2.
vi Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business B The fluctuations arise as follows: 2006 2005 m m US operations: Movements in market value of derivatives other than equity-based used for economic hedging purposes 34 122 Actual less longer-term investment returns for other items 20 56 C Asian operations 134 32 Other operations 26 1 162 211 vii Shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes 2006 2005 m m D Actuarial gains and losses Actual less expected return on scheme assets 156 544 Experience gains on liabilities 18 1 Gains losses on changes of assumptions for scheme liabilities 311 489 485 56 E Less: amount attributable to the PAC with-profits sub-fund 318 58 167 2 Non-recurrent credit charge Shareholders share of credit arising from reduction in level of assumed future discretionary increases for Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS for pensions in payment to 2.5% 35 Losses on re-estimation of shareholders share of deficits arising from the PSPS a 63 F Strengthening in actuarial provisions for increase in ongoing contributions for future service of active scheme members b 20 48 Total 167 50 a Up to 31 December 2004, the deficits arising on the PSPS had been assessed as being 80 per cent attributable to the PAC with-profits fund and 20 per cent to shareholder G operations.
In 2005, following additional analysis this apportionment was altered so that a ratio of 70 30 was applied to the PSPS deficit at 31 December 2005.
For 2006, the opening deficit of the PSPS scheme has been allocated in the ratios 70 30 between the with-profits fund and shareholder-backed operations.
The ratio has continued to be applied to movements in the financial position that relate to opening assets and liabilities.
However, the service charge and contributions for ongoing service are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current business.
b As a result of the April 2005 scheme valuation and subsequent discussions, the contribution levels for future ongoing service of active members were approximately doubled.
The charge of 20 million in 2005 reflected the actuarial provision for this increase in expenses for certain insurance contracts.
H Further details on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are shown in note I1.
viii Share-based payments The charge for share-based payments for Prudential schemes is for the SAYE and Group performance-related schemes.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential A ordinary shares.
The Groups only class of dilutive potential ordinary shares are those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

With the exception of some US institutional business, products categorised as insurance refer to those classified as contracts of long-term insurance business for regulatory reporting purposes, i. e. falling within one of the classes of insurance specified in part II of Schedule 1 to the Regulated Activities Order under FSA regulations.
D Annual premium and contribution equivalents are calculated as the aggregate of regular new business amounts and one-tenth of single new business amounts.
The tables shown above are provided as an indicative volume measure of transactions undertaken in the reporting period that have the potential to generate profits for shareholders.
The amounts shown are not, and not intended to be, reflective of premium income recorded in the IFRS income statement.
The tables above include a bulk annuity transaction with the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF with a premium of 560 million.
The transaction reflects the arrangement entered into in June 2006 for the reinsurance of non-profit immediate pension annuity liabilities of SAIF to Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL, a shareholder-owned E subsidiary of the Group.
SAIF is a closed ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC long-term fund established by a Court approved Scheme of Arrangement in October 1997, which is solely for the benefit of SAIF policyholders.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of this fund, although they are entitled to investment management fees on this business.
The inclusion of the transaction between SAIF and PRIL as new business in the tables reflects the transfer from SAIF to Prudential shareholders funds of longevity risk, the requirement to set aside supporting capital, and entitlement to surpluses arising on this block of business from the reinsurance arrangement.
For Group reporting purposes the amounts recorded by SAIF and PRIL for the premium are eliminated on consolidation.
The details shown above for insurance products include contributions for contracts that are classified under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts as not containing significant insurance F risk.
These products are described as investment contracts or other financial instruments under IFRS.
Contracts included in this category are primarily certain unit-linked and similar contracts written in UK insurance operations and Guaranteed Investment Contracts and similar funding agreements written in US operations.
New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.
Department of Work and Pensions rebate business is classified as single recurrent business.
Internal vesting business is classified as new business where the contracts include an open market option.
UK and Asian investment products referred to in the table for funds under management above are unit trust, mutual funds and similar types of retail fund management arrangements.
These are unrelated to insurance products that are classified as investment contracts under IFRS 4, as described in the preceding paragraph, although similar G IFRS recognition and measurement principles apply to the acquisition costs and fees attaching to this type of business.
US investment products are no longer included in the table above as they are assets under administration rather than funds under management.
In previous periods new business premiums for intermediated distribution of UK insurance operations have included Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate business for SAIF.
As shareholders have no interest in SAIF, these are now excluded from the table above with comparatives restated accordingly.
The amounts of new SAIF DWP rebate business written were 60 million for 2006, and 83 million for 2005.
