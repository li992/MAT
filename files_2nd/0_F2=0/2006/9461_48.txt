The reclassi cation from current tax relates to temporary differences, with the group receiving a current tax bene t in previous periods which will be reversed in future periods.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
An analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes is shown in the table below: 2006 2005 m m Deferred tax assets 50.6 36.0 Deferred tax liabilities 164.4 56.3 113.8 20.3 At 31 December 2006, the group had unused tax losses of 298.4 million 2005: 170.6 million available for offset against future taxable pro ts for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised.
At 31 December 2006, 88.3 million 2005: 25.4 million of the unused losses are subject to time expiry rules and will expire in full on or before 31 December 2022.
No deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The group has estimated that tax of 14.6 million 2005: 16.4 million would arise in respect of remitting all earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the United Kingdom to the extent legally possible.
