Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 1.
General information Tullett Prebon plc is a company incorporated on 5 May 2006 in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is Cable House, 54-62 New Broad Street, London EC2M 1ST.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 3 to 9.
On 15 December 2006, Tullett Prebon plc became the holding company of Collins Stewart Tullett plc in accordance with a court approved scheme of arrangement under S425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The acquisition of Collins Stewart Tullett plc by Tullett Prebon plc constitutes a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using reverse acquisition accounting principles as set out in IFRS 3: Business Combinations.
The Group results for the year ended 31 December 2006 as well as the 2005 comparatives are prepared on the basis of the reverse acquisition principles.
On 19 December 2006, under the scheme of arrangement the Collins Stewart stockbroking business was demerged from the Group.
Results for Collins Stewart for 2005 and 2006 have been included in the consolidated income statement as discontinued operations.
The consolidated balance sheet for 2005 contains both inter-dealer broking and stockbroking activities, whilst 2006 contains inter-dealer broking only.
The impact of the demerger is reflected throughout the financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures: IFRIC 7: Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economics: IFRIC 8: Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9: Reassessment of embedded derivatives: and IFRIC 10: Interim reporting and impairments.
IFRS7 came into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the Standard and the Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for additional disclosures on financial instruments.
The Group has opted for early adoption of IFRIC 11: IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions, the effective date being for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
There is no net impact on the results, however adoption has impacted the geographic segments in note 3.
2. a Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand expressed as millions to one decimal place m, except where otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The demerger has resulted in some minor reclassifications in the comparatives of the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
28 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2006 Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition Revenue from total operations, which excludes value added tax, includes the profit on buying and selling securities, the profit or loss arising on positions held in securities, gross commissions, brokerage, fees earned and subscriptions for information sales.
Dividends and interest arising on long and short positions in securities form part of revenue, and as they are also reflected in movements in market prices, are not identified separately.
Fee income is recognised when the related services are completed and the income is considered receivable.
Revenue also includes interest receivable on segregated client money accounts.
Other interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Groups right to receive the payment is established.
Revenue of the continuing inter-dealer broking business comprises: i Name give up brokerage, where counterparties to a transaction settle directly with each other.
Invoices are raised monthly for the provision of the service of matching buyers and sellers of financial instruments.
Revenue is stated net of sales taxes, rebates and discounts and is recognised in full on trade date: ii Matched principal brokerage, revenue being the net of the buy and sell proceeds from counterparties who have simultaneously committed to buy and sell the financial instrument.
Revenue is recognised on trade date: and iii Fees earned from the sales of real-time price information from financial and commodity markets to third party information vendors.
Revenue is recognised on an accruals basis.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but does not control or jointly control, through participation in the financial and operating policies decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over these policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the profit and loss in the year of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint venture arrangements, which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venture has an interest, are referred to as jointly controlled entities.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation the Groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entities are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the goodwill allocated to that unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Tullett Prebon plc 29 Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2006 2. a Summary of significant accounting policies continued Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included within the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented separately in the balance sheet.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible assets Software and software development costs An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups software development is recognised at cost only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development costs of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where the above conditions are not met costs are expensed as incurred.
Acquired separately or from a business combination Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Where amortisation is charged on finite assets, this expense is taken to the income statement through other administrative expenses.
Other than software development costs, intangible assets created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Software purchased or developed Software licences Useful life Finite Finite Method used 3 years straight-line Amortised over life of licences Internally generated or acquired Internally generated and acquired Acquired only Impairment testing recoverable Method reviewed at each Method reviewed at each amount testing financial year-end financial year-end Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is stated at cost.
Buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Furniture, fixtures, equipment and motor vehicles 10% 33% pa Short and long leasehold land and buildings over the period of the lease Freehold land nil Freehold buildings 1% pa Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets with finite lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
30 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2006 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less any cost to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Investments in securities Investments in securities, which do not relate to inter-dealer broker settlement balances see below, are recognised and derecognised on a trade-date basis where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned.
Investments are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investments which are classified as held for trading or available-for-sale, are measured at fair value.
Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in income.
Gains or losses on available-for-sale investments are recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, that is, the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Pending regular way purchases and sales with customers are included in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables see settlement balances below.
Settlement balances Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase of and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the deal are settled, and the Group is exposed to risk in the event that one side of the transaction remains unmatched.
The amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business expected to settle in the normal course of trading are shown gross within trade debtors or trade creditors as appropriate.
Outstanding transactions which have gone beyond settlement date where neither side of the transaction has settled and transactions where one side has settled, but the other remains outstanding continue to be shown gross within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables until the transaction is completed.
Securities borrowing Securities are borrowed in the ordinary course of business.
All borrowing is collateralised and such collateral is included in trade debtors.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are settled within normal market cycles.
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Other financial assets Available-for-sale assets, other investments and money market instruments are held at cost which approximates to fair value.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Tullett Prebon plc 31 Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2. a Summary of significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using relevant market data on foreign exchange and interest rates.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: cash flow hedges where they hedge an exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction: or net investment hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the reported value of foreign currency denominated net assets.
In relation to fair value hedges that meet the IAS 39 requirements for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the income statement such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
In relation to net investment hedges and cash flow hedges that meet the IAS 39 requirements for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
When hedged forecast transactions result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects the income statement: for example, when the future sale actually occurs.
For derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for a cash flow hedge, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Client money The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Services Authority and other regulatory bodies.
Such money and the corresponding liabilities to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet where they relate to segregated deposits, as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
Client money held to settle outstanding bargains is held on the balance sheet.
The net return received on managing client money is included within revenue.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits, which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Derecognition of financial instruments The derecognition of financial instruments takes place when all the derecognition criteria of IAS 39 are met and the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all of the cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event where it is probable that this will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring, which has been notified to affected parties.
32 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2006 Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Group, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Gains and losses arising from the settlement of these transactions, and from the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement.
Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency that are measured at historical cost or fair value, are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or at the date the fair value was determined.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and movements in deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Temporary differences are not recognised if they arise from goodwill or from initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Retirement benefit costs Defined contributions made to employees personal pension plans are charged to the income statement as and when incurred.
For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing the benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the amended benefits become vested.
Tullett Prebon plc 33 Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2. a Summary of significant accounting policies continued The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised past service cost, and reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the unrecognised actuarial losses and past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share options issued is determined using a Black Scholes valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
2. b Accounting estimations In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Group makes certain accounting judgements and estimations that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of goodwill Judgements are made as to the necessity for impairment of the carrying value of goodwill based on estimations of future cash flows.
Taxation Judgements are made as to the carrying value of tax provisions where the outcome remains uncertain.
Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting format is geographical: Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and its secondary reporting format is product group.
The change in primary and secondary segments from 2005 is due to the demerger of the Collins Stewart stockbroking business.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 1.7m 2005: 1.8m of such losses.
No deferred tax assets had been recognised in respect of the remaining 6.4m 2005: 4.5m due to the unpredictability of the necessary future profit streams.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised was 2.5m 2005: 3.1m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

Share-based payments The Group has a number of equity based long term incentive plans for the granting of non-transferable options to certain employees and executives.
Options granted under the plans vest on the first day on which they become exercisable, which is typically 3 years after grant date.
The exercise of options within some of the option schemes is also dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria, all of which are non-market conditions.
The maximum life of the options is ten years.
These options are settled in equity once exercised and, dependent on the option scheme, will be settled either with new shares issued or shares purchased in the market.
Following the introduction of Tullett Prebon plc as the holding company of Collins Stewart Tullett plc on 15 December 2006, awards outstanding under the Tullett Liberty Equity Incentive Plan the EIP were exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in Tullett Prebon plc under the terms of the rules of the EIP.
Awards outstanding under the approved and unapproved share option schemes were also exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in Tullett Prebon plc.
Participants rights were preserved and the performance target applicable to the awards was adjusted to reflect the demerger of the stockbroking business to Collins Stewart plc.
In order to preserve the economic value of the options, the number of shares over which options were held was increased by a factor equivalent to the average Collins Stewart Tullett plc share price for the four trading days immediately prior to the demerger divided by the average Tullett Prebon plc share price for the four trading days immediately following the demerger a ratio of 1.356:1.

Movements in settlement balances are reflected in operating cash flows.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world, all of which, with the three exceptions identified below, are defined contribution schemes.
The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contract-based policies of insurance, except for those held in the US to match the liabilities of a supplemental executive retirement plan SERP C. The Group operates defined benefit schemes in the UK and in North America: i The Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme Defined Benefit Section is a defined benefit final salary funded pension scheme.
The Principal Employer of the scheme is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new members in 1991 and since May 2003 future accrual on a defined benefit basis has ceased.
Members in service in 1991 receive benefits on the better of a money purchase underpin and defined benefit basis.
For defined benefit section members in service in May 2003 there is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
ii The Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme is a defined benefit final salary funded pension scheme.
The Principal Employer of the scheme is Tullett Prebon UK Limited.
The scheme was closed to new members in 1989 and since April 2006 future accrual on a defined benefit basis has ceased.
Members receive benefits on the better of a money purchase underpin and defined benefit basis.
For members in service in April 2006 there is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
iii The Prebon Yamane US SERP C plan provides participants in the US and Canada with retirement benefits for 10 or 15 years at a specified dollar amount.
The entitlement of the participants to the plan benefits vests over time in accordance with length of service, up to a maximum period of 10 years.
SERP C was introduced in 1992 and the last participant was admitted in 1999.
The previous plan, SERP B, provided participants with a target retirement benefit, but all investment gains and losses are borne by the participant and plan B is therefore treated as a defined contribution scheme.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid into the UK defined benefit schemes during 2007 is 2.3m 2006: 2.1m.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The latest actuarial valuations of the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme and of the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme together, the UK defined benefit schemes were carried out as at 30 April 2004 and 1 January 2004 respectively by independent qualified actuaries.
In both cases the present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the vested liabilities under the Prebon Yamane US SERP C are recalculated monthly using an appropriate discount rate and the necessary additional accrual or release of accrual is made in the accounts of the relevant subsidiary undertaking as a pension cost.
As at 31 December 2006 the SERP C liability included in the balance sheet was 1.3m 2005: 1.6m.
In order to cover this liability the Group holds policies of insurance with a cash surrender value as at 31 December 2006 of 1.9m 2005: 1.5m.
The main financial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries of the UK defined benefit schemes to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2006 2005 %% Key assumptions used: Discount rate 5.10 4.70 Expected return on schemes assets 7.05 6.70 Expected rate of salary increases 4.35 4.15 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 3.10 2.80 Inflation assumption 3.10 2.90 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive fixed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2004 funding valuations.
For the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme the assumptions are that a member who retires in future at age 60 will live on average for a further 28 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31 years after retirement if they are female.
For the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme the equivalent assumptions are 24 years for males and 27 years for females.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a consistent but generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
These assumptions will be reviewed as part of the 2007 triennial actuarial valuations.
