The fair value of the plan assets and the return on those assets were as follows: MRGPS CRPPAS Six months Six months ended ended 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 2006 2005 000 000 000 000 Equities 7,011 3,106 5,973 4,461 Bonds 1,843 945 5,309 5,261 Other 38 23 1,991 1,716 8,892 4,074 13,273 11,438 Actual return on plan assets 1,635 280 1,639 702 The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is assessed by considering the current level of returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds and the expectations for the risk premium of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Principal actuarial assumptions expressed as weighted averages : MRGPS MRGPS CRPPAS CRPPAS 2006 2005 Discount rates 4.85% 5.30% Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.50% 6.00% Indexed pension increases 3.25% 3.25% Future salary increases 4.00% 4.50% Other material assumptions inflation 2.90% 2.75% For mortality rates the Group has used PA92 tables 2005: MRGPS PA80, CRPPAS PA92 with mortality projected to 2025 2005: MRGPS 2020, CRPPAS: 2030 for pensioner members.
Expectation of life at normal retirement age is 24.9 years for males and 27.9 for females.

GCap Media plc Annual Report 2005 06 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Employee benefits continued Share-based payments The income statement includes a charge for share-based payments of 2.4 million six months ended 31 March 2005: 0.6 million.
Of the 2.4 million, 1.6 million was included within separately disclosed items.
These charges arise when employees are granted awards under the Groups share option scheme, savings-related share scheme or long-term incentive plan LTIP.
The charges equate to the fair value of the award.
This has been calculated using the Monte Carlo, Bi-nomial and BlackScholes models, using the most appropriate model for each scheme.
Assumptions have been made in these models as to expectations of early exercise, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and dividend yield.
The Company has not applied IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment retrospectively and therefore IFRS has only been applied to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 which had not vested before 1 January 2005.
The Groups annual charge is therefore likely to increase as share-based awards are granted over the next two years.
Details of the schemes, including the required vesting conditions, can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The amounts awarded under the LTIP are also detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report and all awards under other schemes are detailed in note 20.
All schemes are equity-settled apart from the Interim Merger Scheme.
A summary of the status of the share schemes as at 31 March 2006, changes during the year and details of awards granted during the year is presented below: 31 March 2006 31 March 2005 Weighted Weighted average average exercise price Number exercise price Number pence of options pence of options Outstanding at start of period 497.3 5,063,043 528.7 4,798,585 Expired during the period 480.3 668,244 796.9 44,437 Cancelled during the period 348.1 270,994 373.9 102,897 Exercised during the period 297.0 12,644 332.0 24,100 Granted during the period 144.0 2,676,305 159.0 700,840 Forfeited during the period 251.7 519,576 184.0 264,948 Outstanding at end of period 375.5 6,267,890 497.3 5,063,043 Exercisable at end of period 464.4 1,070,982 634.8 33,081 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of share options exercised during the period was 292.0p 2005: 415.2p.
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of 220.0p to 502.50p.
Dividends will be rolled up and paid to the participants on date of vesting with the transfer of shares.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility derived from publicly available information.
All of the above schemes have performance conditions attached apart from GWR SRSOS and the SAYE.
The performance conditions for the 1998 scheme for Directors, the LTIP and the 2005 LTIP are market-based, and are taken into account in the fair value.
The total expenses recognised for the period arising from share-based payments are as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Equity-settled share-based payment expense 1,674 593 Cash-settled share-based payment expense 761 Total carrying amount of liabilities 761 Total intrinsic carrying amount of liabilities in respect of vested benefits Disclosure basis and assumptions for fair value assessment of cash-settled schemes The fair value of the equity-settled part of the awards under the Interim Merger Share Scheme at grant date is equal to the market price of the shares at close of business immediately preceding the date of grant.
No deduction has been made for dividends because it is assumed that the Remuneration Committee will exercise its discretion to transfer the rolled-up value of any dividends accrued between date of grant and vesting to the participants in addition to the shares promised under the Scheme.
The fair value of the cash-settled part of the awards under the Interim Merger Share Scheme is re-measured at each balance sheet date and settlement date.
The fair value in this case is equal to the market price of the shares on the balance sheet date plus the value of dividends accrued between the date of award and the date of measurement.
