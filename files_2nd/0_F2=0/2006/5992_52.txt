Description of IFRS adjustments Goodwill Acquired intangible assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its expected useful economic life, which was normally 20 years.
Under IFRS 3 Business combinations, goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and hence is not subject to amortisation.
Instead it is reviewed for impairment annually.
IFRS also requires that, on acquisition, specic intangible assets are identied and recognised and then amortised over their useful economic lives.
Associates Under UK GAAP, the groups investments in Confetti Network Limited and The Webb Group Limited were accounted for as trade investments as the group did not exercise a significant inuence over the operating policies of the businesses.
Under IFRS, the group will account for these investments as associates using the equity method, as IFRS requires an investment to be classied as an associate where the investor has the potential to exercise significant inuence, irrespective of whether this inuence is actually being exercised.
Income recognition The adoption of IAS 18 Revenue has resulted in a small number of changes to the reported UK GAAP gures, primarily in relation to the recognition of carriage costs recovered from customers in turnover.
Home Shopping debtor book Under UK GAAP the groups debtor book in its Home Shopping division was stated at invoiced cost less a provision for doubtful debts.
Under IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the debtor book is stated at amortised cost less a provision for impairment.
Post employment benets Under UK GAAP, the group accounted for retirement benets under SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
This standard sought to spread the cost of providing dened benefit pension and post retirement benets over the estimated average remaining service life of the scheme members based upon a triennial valuation.
Under IFRS, the group is required to calculate the pension cost for dened benefit pension schemes and other post employment benets using a Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Under UK GAAP, unrealised gains and losses on all of the groups hedging arrangements were deferred until the underlying transaction, for which they provided a hedge, was completed.
Under IFRS, movements in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement within nancing costs.
Holiday pay IFRS requires the group to accrue for holidays earned by its employees but not taken by the balance sheet date.
60 37 Reconciliation of IFRS comparatives from previously published UK GAAP financial information continued Dividends Under UK GAAP, the group recognised a liability for dividends that were proposed in respect of a prior accounting period, even if the formal authorisation of the dividend did not take place until after the year end.
In accordance with IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet date, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability in the financial statements, as there is no present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based payments requires the group to record a charge for all share-based payments equivalent to the fair value of the award as at the date of the grant.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over its vesting period on a straight-line basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest.
As permitted by the standard, the group has applied IFRS 2 to all unvested share awards as at the transition date.
Taxation Under UK GAAP, the group recognised deferred tax on timing differences that arose from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they were recognised in the financial statements an income statement approach.
Under IAS 12 Deferred tax, deferred tax is recognised in respect of nearly all taxable temporary timing differences arising between the tax base and the accounting book value of balance sheet items a balance sheet approach.
This results in deferred tax being recognised on certain timing differences that would not have given rise to deferred tax under UK GAAP.
Retranslation of foreign subsidiaries Under UK GAAP, the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries were translated into sterling at the appropriate closing rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
With IFRS, the income statement of foreign subsidiaries is translated at the average rate for the period, with exchange differences taken to a separate translation reserve.
