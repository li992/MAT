IFRS 2 requires the fair value of share option awards to be expensed in the income statement over the vesting period of the options, with a corresponding amount recorded in the Reserve for sharebased payments.
Deferred tax has been calculated on the taxable value of the share options.
2 Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year to which they relate.
IAS 10 requires that dividends are recorded in the year that they are declared.
IAS 32 and 39 amendments EIR calculation 3 Accrued cash interest receivable forms part of the EIR calculation under IFRS and, therefore, is now included in the value of loans and investments.
EIR calculations have increased the value of mezzanine loans in comparison to the recognition of assets under UK GAAP.
4 Accrued cash interest payable forms part of the EIR calculation under IFRS and, therefore, is now included in the value of financial liabilities.
Also includes the net impact of EIR calculations on borrowings and IFRS 1 fair value hedging adjustment relating to the hedging of borrowings for currency and interest rate risk.
Valuation of investments 5 Increase in fair value of warrants and the fair value of quoted and unquoted investments.
Impairment of assets 6 The difference between the effect of discounting the expected future cash flows on impaired assets under IFRS and provisions made under UK GAAP.
Derivatives 7 IFRS requires that derivatives are recorded at fair value rather than being accounted for in the same way as the underlying hedged item.
Taxation and reserves 8 Impact of IFRS on deferred tax provision.
9 The reconciliation of reserves as detailed on page 69.

2 Net impact of EIR calculations on borrowings and IFRS 1 fair value hedging adjustment relating to the hedging of borrowings for currency and interest rate risk.
3 As the value of non-cash interest has increased under IFRS, an increase in the accrual for bonus on the non-cash interest is required.
Impairment of assets 4 The difference between the effect of discounting the expected future cash flows on impaired assets under IFRS and provisions made under UK GAAP.
Valuation of investments 5 The increased charge for the Medium Term Incentive Scheme due to increase in warrants in the period.
6 Investments are held at their fair value or on an amortised cost basis under IFRS rather than cost.
This increase relates primarily to loan stock.
7 Under IFRS warrants and warrants now held as shares previously valued at cost are now fair valued where this can be reliably measured.
Derivatives 8 IFRS requires that derivatives are recorded at fair value rather than being accounted for in the same way as the underlying hedged item.
Non IAS 32 IAS 39 adjustments 9 IFRS 2 requires the fair value of share option awards to be expensed in the income statement over the vesting period of the options, with a corresponding amount recorded in the Reserve for share-based payments.
10 Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year to which they relate.
Taxation 11 The net impact on taxation of the above adjustments.
