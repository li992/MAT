At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1 621 million and tax credits amounting to 338 million available for offset against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 1 243 million and tax credits of 338 million, as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 494 million of state and federal tax losses in the USA which expire between now and 2026.
Other deductible temporary differences of 199 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 755 million 2005: 765 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the forseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same scal authority.
