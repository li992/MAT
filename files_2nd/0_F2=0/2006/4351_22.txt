0346 DC AR 2006 p38-67 7 6 06 8:32 am Page 48 48 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental information The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products produced.
The Group is organised and managed in two divisions, Foods and Dairies according to the nature of the products sold and markets serviced.
The Household business is included within the Dairies segment as its operations are considered to be mutually interdependent with the Liquid Products business.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, the business segments were defined as Consumer Foods and Foods Services.
The change in composition of these segments to Foods and Dairies better reflects the split of risks and returns of the Groups operations.
Prior year comparative numbers have been restated.
The impact of this restatement was to reallocate certain elements of the Liquid Products business, that had previously been reported under Consumer Foods, into the new Dairies segment.
The impact on revenue, the comparatives for which have not been affected by the conversion to IFRS, was to reduce Consumer Foods by 281.8 million to 517.3 million now reported as Foods.
Inter-segment sales are not material.
All revenue is derived from the sale of goods.
The Groups geographical segments are based on the location of the Groups assets.
Turnover originates principally in the United Kingdom and assets and liabilities are located principally in the United Kingdom and therefore no geographical segment disclosures have been made for these items.
Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of its customers.
The following tables present revenue, profit and certain assets and liabilities by segment for the years ended 31 March 2006 and 2005.
They exclude deferred taxation, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives held as hedges of borrowings.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities.
They exclude taxation, retirement benefit obligations, borrowings and related hedges.
This rationalisation includes the closure of certain depots the profit on which is shown above, acquisition of small infill dairy businesses and rationalisation of the ongoing household operations.
These activities represent a fundamental part of the ongoing ordinary activities of the household operations.
The net profit on rationalisation of the household business, after deducting related rationalisation costs, amounted to 3.9 million in the year ended 31 March 2006 2005: 3.1 million.

The integration resulted in an exceptional cost of 12.7 million, being 3.5 million of redundancy costs, 1.0 million of asset write-downs, 4.5 million of duplicate running costs as volume was transferred from the Birmingham dairy to other parts of the Group up to its closure in February 2006 and 3.7 million of other rationalisation costs.
ii integrating the Arla London Foodservice business into the Group which amounted to 2.6 million, of which 1.6 million related to redundancy costs and 1.0 million related to other rationalisation costs.
The cash cost of the exceptional items described above amounted to 14.3 million in the year ended 31 March 2006.
These were all incurred in the Dairies segment.
Further to a review of the value in use of the goodwill and assets of the speciality cheese business part of the Foods segment, an impairment to the carrying value of goodwill 2.3 million and property, plant and equipment 7.0 million has been recognised.
Further details describing the impairment test and resulting write-down are set out in Note 11.
The profit on disposal of closed sites related to a surplus dairy in Newport which was sold in March 2006 for a consideration of 1.7 million resulting in a profit on disposal of 1.4 million.
Restructuring costs of 1.1 million in the year ended 31 March 2005 principally related to the final commissioning of the creamery at Davidstow.
In addition, there was a 0.7 million profit on the disposal of closed dairy sites.
The Groups share of joint ventures exceptional items, after tax, amounted to 0.8 million in the year ended 31 March 2006 and related to a profit on disposal of a closed factory in Enfield see Note 14.
The share of joint ventures exceptional items, after tax, in the year ended 31 March 2005 was 2.8 million representing restructuring costs related to factory closures.
6 Tax expense The major components of income tax expense for the years ended 31 March 2006 and 2005 are: Year ended Year ended 31 March 2006 31 March 2005 Consolidated income statement m m 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Current income tax: Current income tax charge at 30% 2005: 30% 7.9 18.4 Adjustments in respect of previous years current tax 3.0 0.7 transfer to from deferred tax 1.3 0.3 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 3.6 18.0 Deferred income tax: Relating to origination and reversal of temporary differences 1.6 0.9 Transfer from to current tax 1.3 0.3 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 6.5 18.6 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Reconciliation between tax expense and the profit before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK: Year ended Year ended 31 March 2006 31 March 2005 m m 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Profit before tax 41.3 70.2 Tax at UK statutory income tax rate of 30% 2005: 30% 12.4 21.1 Adjustments in respect of previous years 3.0 0.7 Adjustment for overseas profits taxed at different rates 0.3 Adjustment in respect of joint ventures profits 2.2 0.7 Non-deductible expenses 1.4 1.6 Profits offset by available tax relief 1.8 2.7 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 At the effective rate of 16% 2005: 26% 6.5 18.6 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 The effective pre-exceptional rate of tax on Group profit before tax after adjusting for joint ventures tax is 24% 2005: 28%.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and they have arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss-making for some time.
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of 66.5 million 2005: 66.5 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable gains.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of their being utilised.
The Group has realised capital gains amounting to 39.6 million 2005: 33.6 million for which rollover relief claims have or are intended to be made.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in relation to these gains because there is no prospect of a chargeable gain arising on the disposal of the replacement assets.
At 31 March 2006, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2005: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries in Ireland as the Group has determined that retained profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax liability arising from the investments in these subsidiaries, which has not been recognised, is 2.4 million 2005: 2.1 million.

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the directors opinion reflects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share have been calculated.

The carrying value of goodwill was 2.3 million and the remaining 7.0 million impairment was applied to property, plant and equipment.
Further narrative relating to this impairment is given in Note 11.
A further 1.0 million has been written off redundant assets resulting from the acquisition of Midlands Co-operative Dairies.
This has been charged as an exceptional item see Note 4.
All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 8% 2005: 8%.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for Spreads and Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese is 2.5% pa being the UK long-term growth rate.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for the Speciality Cheese and Dairies CGUs is 0%.
The extrapolated growth rate for Dairies reflects the underlying decline in the doorstep business within the wider Dairies CGU.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to CGUs at 31 March 2006 is: Dairies 61.5 million 2005: 38.5 million Spreads 65.5 million 2005: 65.5 million Speciality Cheese Nil 2005: 2.3 million Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese 4.1 million 2005: 4.1 million 0346 DC AR 2006 p38-67 9 6 06 11:10 am Page 56 56 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Goodwill continued The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations: Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Gross margin percentages beyond three years are assumed to be constant.
Discount rates reflect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group.
This is the benchmark used internally by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three-year time frame.
For the household business within Dairies, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash-generating unit and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Spreads and Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Dairies CGU, there are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
These are discussed as follows: Future growth rates: Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should the decline in the household business more than offset growth in the liquid products business, resulting in an overall rate of decline beyond year three, value in use for the CGU could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
Gross margins: Management has assumed stable gross margins after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should the margin percentage deteriorate, value in use could be reduced towards a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
Following an assessment of the value-in-use of the Speciality Cheese CGU, goodwill has been written down to nil 2005: 2.3 million.
Management continues to take actions to improve the efficiency and profitability of the Speciality Cheese CGU but, despite a good Christmas, the Stilton market in particular continues to be challenging.
These market pressures inevitably impact the cash generating capacity of this CGU and management considers it necessary to recognise an impairment to reflect this.
The total impairment to the carrying value of assets is 9.3 million comprising a 2.3 million write-down of goodwill and a 7.0 million write-down of property, plant and equipment see Note 10.
Computer software represents expenditure incurred on a new financials software package implemented across the Group in the year ended 31 March 2006.
The remaining amortisation life for computer software is 4.5 years and for acquired contracts is 24 years.

Details of the Groups interest rate management strategy and interest rate swaps are included in Notes 29 and 30.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify maximum net debt to EBITDA, and minimum EBITDA to interest ratios.
No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2006.
20 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees, both of which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
These comprise the Dairy Crest Group pension fund and the Wexford Creamery Limited pension fund.
The Dairy Crest Group pension fund will be closed for new employees joining after 30 June 2006.
Employees joining after this date will be invited to join a Dairy Crest Group defined contribution plan.
Yoplait Dairy Crest, a 49% owned joint venture also has a defined benefit pension plan.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was carried out as at 31 March 2004 by the funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
The Group has charged 0.2 million 2005: 0.2 million in respect of a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURB for a director whose benefits are restricted by Inland Revenue limits.
Under this defined contribution scheme, 42.7% of salary was contributed by the Group to his FURB in the year ended 31 March 2006 2005: 42.7%.
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the defined benefit plans.
These plans are all wholly funded.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.
The expected rate of return on equities of 8% reflects historic UK equity returns and is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size.
The expected rate of return on bonds of 4.9% is based upon the gross redemption yield available on a similar profile of gilts and corporate bonds.
Included in the above analysis is the Wexford Creamery pension fund.
The net benefit expense in the year ended 31 March 2006 amounted to 0.3 million 2005: 0.3 million.
The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2006 was 7.1 million 2005: 5.5 million and the defined benefit obligation was 9.4 million 2005: 7.8 million resulting in a scheme deficit of 2.3 million 2005: 2.3 million.

The conditions that apply until that date are within the control of the Group.
The merger reserve includes the premium on shares issued to satisfy the purchase of Dairy Crest Limited in 1996.
The cumulative amount of goodwill charged against the merger reserve is 86.8 million 2005: 86.8 million.
The reserve is not distributable.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are available to satisfy awards under LTISP and ESOS.
The QUEST was terminated in April 2005 and held no shares at 31 March 2006.
During the year ended 31 March 2005 850,389 shares were issued to the QUEST at a premium of 3.4 million for an aggregate consideration of 3.6 million.
At 31 March 2006 the ESOP held 489,075 shares 2005: 535,791 shares in the Company at a cost of 1.5 million 2005: 1.6 million.
The ESOP was established in August 1996 to purchase shares in the Company in order to hedge certain future obligations of the Group including shares awarded under the LTISP and the ESOS.
During the year the Trustee of the ESOP issued 46,716 2005: 725,331 shares following exercises of LTISP options.
The market value of the shares held by the ESOP which are listed on the London Stock Exchange was 2.3 million at 31 March 2006 2005: 2.5 million.
The hedging reserve records the movements on designated hedging items, offset by any movements recognised directly in equity on underlying hedging items.

The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is 18.1 million 2005: 50.8 million including dividends received from subsidiary companies of 20 million 2005: Nil.
Dividends paid amounted to 25.6 million 2005: 23.7 million which, along with a credit for share based payments of 0.2 million 2005: 0.3 million resulted in a 7.3 million decrease in retained earnings 2005: 27.4 million increase.
In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited.
Consideration was in the form of cash and the issue of 109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each.
The fair value of the shares issued was estimated as 170.2 million.
The capital reserve of 142.7 million represents the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of 27.5 million.
25 Share based payment plans Group The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on total shareholder return TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and growth in earnings per share.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years.
On 7 July 2005, 632,186 options were granted under the LTISP scheme July 2004: 763,264.
There are no cash settlement alternatives available to the participants of the scheme.
0346 DC AR 2006 p38-67 8 6 06 6:53 pm Page 63 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 63 25 Share based payment plans continued Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All UK employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
On 12 December 2005 1,611,689 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme at a grant price of 388 pence.
No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2005.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Options granted under the Dairy Crest ESOS to subscribe for the Companys shares can be exercised up to 2012.
No options have been granted under this scheme since 22 July 2002.
Share options outstanding at 31 March 2006 are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2012 at prices of 189p, 341.5p and 415p ESOS and up to September 2009 at prices ranging from 368p to 388p Sharesave Scheme.
LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2015.
The remaining average weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2006 is 8.39 years for the LTISP, 5.18 years for the ESOS and 2.67 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2005: 8.45 years, 5.79 years and 2.09 years respectively.
The weighted average share price at the time of exercise of LTISP options was 4.89 2005: 3.91, on exercise of ESOS options was 4.75 2005: none and on exercise of Sharesave options was 4.77 2005: 4.33.
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in December 2005 is 31% giving a fair value of 1.50 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black Scholes option pricing model.
The number of share options granted has been adjusted for leavers in the period to 31 March 2006.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2005 grant were: Expected share price volatility 28%, risk free rate of interest 4.1% and dividend yield 3.5%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
There were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2005.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in July 2005 is 65% July 2004: 48% giving a fair value of 3.12 per option granted 2005: 1.91.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on earnings per share and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
The earnings per share condition is not expected to be satisfied for any of the unvested LTISPs and therefore no charge has been assumed for this element.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2006 were as follows: Term 3 years 2005: 3 years Volatility 28% 2005: 26% Risk free rate 4.1% 2005: 5.0% Average volatility of comparator TSR 22% 2005: 32% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 9% 2005: 11% The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2006 is 1.1 million 2005: 1.7 million See Note 9.
The remaining average weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2006 is 8.48 years for the LTISP, 5.81 years for the ESOS and 1.83 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2005: 8.61 years, 6.81 years and 2.42 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of Sharesave options was 4.77 2005: 4.33.
The Company expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2006 was 0.2 million 2005: 0.3 million.
26 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain land and buildings, vehicles and equipment.
Excluding land and buildings, these leases have an average life of between three and five years with no renewal option, escalation clauses or purchase options included in the contracts.

As a result, disclosure of the profit for the year ended 31 March 2006 is impracticable.
The revenue and profit of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2006, assuming the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2005 would not be materially different from the actual revenue and profit reported in the consolidated income statement.
On 16 May 2005 the Group acquired the dairy business and assets of the Midlands Co-operative Society for a cash consideration of 20.3 million including fees.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the business as at the date of acquisition was: Fair value Book to Group value m m 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Property, plant and equipment 4.4 6.1 Intangible assets 3.6 Inventories 1.6 1.4 Receivables 0.5 0.4 Payables 2.4 1.6 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 5555 Net assets 7.7 6.3 5555 Goodwill 12.6 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 Cash consideration 20.3 1555555555555555555555555555 5555 On 29 October 2005 the Group acquired the business and fixed assets of Arlas London Foodservice business, including a freehold site in London, for a cash consideration of 4.2 million including fees.

The Midlands Co-operative Society acquisition completed on 16 May 2005 and the revenue and profit of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2006, assuming the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2005 would not be materially different from the actual revenue and profit reported in the consolidated income statement.
Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets that cannot be separably identified and measured due to their nature.
In the case of Household acquisitions, this includes acquired milk round lists.
Management believes that goodwill represents value to the Group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
The majority of the value was assessed to comprise of synergy benefits expected to be achieved by merging the business acquired into the Groups existing operations.
During the year ended 31 March 2005 the Group acquired the remaining 44% interest in English Butter Marketing Company Limited for a cash consideration of 4.6 million giving rise to goodwill on acquisition of 4.6 million.

The fair value of the net assets acquired was 0.3 million resulting in goodwill of 6.0 million.
29 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that forecast net borrowings plus a reasonable operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
At 31 March 2006 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 405 million 2005: 470 million excluding finance leases of 18 million 2005: 18 million.
The facility consists of a five year term loan of 80 million repayable in four semi-annual instalments from December 2007 to June 2009 2005: 80.0 million, a 270 million five year multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in June 2009 2005: 270 million and a five year term loan of 55 million repayable in three semi-annual instalments from September 2006 to September 2007 2005: 120.0 million.
The Group has undrawn long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2006 of 128.3 million 2005: 233.4 million.
Short-term funding requirements are met through uncommitted overdraft and short-term facilities amounting to over 20 million.
New facilities were put in place in April 2006 and are described in Note 33 Post balance sheet events.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
The Groups policy is to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 31 March 2006, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 40% of the Groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest 2005: 75%.
Foreign currency risk Transaction exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of our overseas subsidiary, Wexford Creamery Limited.
Our policy is to hedge between 80% and 100% of the net asset exposure through borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
At present, our only translation exposure is in Euros.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in Sterling and so transaction exposures are limited.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter, Stilton and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be fixed.
In addition, a substantial part of Yoplait Dairy Crests purchases are denominated in Euros which are hedged up to one year in advance by foreign exchange contracts.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Commodity risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability.
In certain circumstances, forward contracts have been put in place in order to fix future prices, principally for gas and electricity.
These contracts are only entered into with the approval of the executive directors.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
0346 DC AR 2006 p38-67 8 6 06 7:54 pm Page 67 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 67 29 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The household business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 157.5 million 2005: 151.2 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
All borrowings are through banks with strong long-term credit ratings.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with commercial banks with a credit rating of AA or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be low.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity, of the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.
No other financial assets and liabilities, other than those shown below, are exposed directly to interest rate risk.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2006 was 100 million 2005: 170 million.
All interest rate swaps are cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting with the exception of two swaps which have a fair value of nil at 31 March 2006.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next four years.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net asset investment in Wexford Creamery Limited, its subsidiary in Ireland.
The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2006 was 15.3 million 2005: 15.3 million.
The foreign exchange gain of nil 2005: loss of 0.5 million on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in reserves.

Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2006 of 128.3 million 2005: 233.4 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These undrawn facilities expire in June 2009.
On 21 April 2006, 90 million of term loans were repaid and cancelled and a further 20 million was cancelled from the multi-currency revolving credit facility.
These facilities were replaced by loan notes of 143 million issued on 4 April 2006 maturing between seven and ten years.

Dairy Crest Group plc is a limited company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Chief Executives review, Operational review and Financial review on pages 4 to 21.
35 Transition to IFRS Dairy Crest Group plc previously prepared its consolidated financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union apply for the first full year in this Annual Report and Accounts for the year to 31 March 2006.
This note explains how the Groups previously reported financial performance and position are reported under IFRS.
First time adoption of IFRS The rules for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Groups date of transition to IFRS is 1 April 2004 and the comparative information in the financial statements is restated to reflect the Groups adoption of IFRS except where otherwise required or permitted by IFRS 1.
As a general rule IFRS 1 requires these standards to be applied retrospectively.
However, IFRS 1 allows for a number of exemptions to these general principles to assist companies in reporting under IFRS.
The key exemptions the Group has taken advantage of are as follows: Business combinations The Group has not restated business combinations prior to the transition date.
Acquisitions prior to this date will be recorded under previous accounting rules.
IFRS 1 requires that an impairment review of goodwill should be conducted in accordance with IAS 36 at the date of transition and at the balance sheet date.
Dairy Crest has performed this review and no adjustment is required.
Employee benefits The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemption which allows cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to the defined benefit pension schemes to be recognised in full immediately in equity at the transition date.
Cumulative translation differences IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates requires the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised directly in equity in relation to a foreign operation to be transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be set to zero at the transition date.
Financial instruments The Group has elected to apply the exemption which allows companies not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The general principle set out by IAS 39 is that financial assets and liabilities should be recognised at fair value or amortised cost.
These standards will be applied from 1 April 2005 where the fair value of derivatives will be included in the balance sheet.
The net adjustment at 1 April 2005 is 0.3 million comprising the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The exemptions that Dairy Crest has elected not to adopt include the following: IFRS 2 Share-based payments The Group has not adopted the exemption to apply IFRS 2 Share-based payments only to awards made after 7 November 2002.
Fair value or revaluation at deemed cost The Group has not adopted the exemption to restate property, plant and equipment to fair value at the transition date.
Such items have been maintained at historical cost in order to maintain consistency with the Group accounting policy under UK GAAP.
Summary of the major impacts of adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IAS 19 Employee benefits The Group previously accounted for the pensions schemes using SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs and also complied with the transitional rules of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Under IFRS Dairy Crest is required to recognise the net deficits in the Dairy Crest Pension Fund of 64.1 million after deferred tax of 27.4 million and in the Wexford Creamery Limited pension schemes of 1.6 million after deferred tax of 0.2 million and its share of the net deficit in the Yoplait Dairy Crest Final Salary Pension Scheme of 1.1 million after deferred tax of 0.4 million at the transition date.
In addition, the net SSAP 24 pension asset of 3.7 million has been written off.
This has resulted in a net reduction to shareholders equity of 70.2 million.
Despite some minor differences in the method of determining the value of the assets of the pension fund between IAS 19 and FRS 17 there is no material net difference between the balance sheet deficit computed under FRS 17 at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005 and the amount recognised under IAS 19.
IFRS has increased the net pension costs by 7.2 million net of interest income of 0.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
The pension liability recorded on the Group balance sheet at 1 April 2004 was 93.3 million and at 31 March 2005 was 102.7 million.
0346 DC AR 2006 p68-85 8 6 06 7:50 pm Page 71 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 71 35 Transition to IFRS continued IFRS 3 Business combinations IFRS 3 prohibits goodwill amortisation.
All goodwill has been frozen at UK GAAP carrying values on 1 April 2004.
The standard requires goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews undertaken annually and also when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The full year operating profit impact for 2005 is to reduce the amortisation charge and increase net assets by 13.1 million.
IFRS 2 Share-based payments Under IFRS share-based payments must be measured at fair value at grant date and should be recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
This expense is primarily in relation to the Groups Save as You Earn schemes SAYE and Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP.
The Group has sought advice from external valuation specialists to value its share-based payments.
The fair value of the total shareholders return TSR element of the LTISP has been calculated using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The fair value for the Sharesave schemes have been calculated using a Black Scholes model.
The effect of adopting IFRS 2 for the year ended 31 March 2005 has reduced operating profit by 1.7 million.
Additionally there is a cumulative charge for the adoption of IFRS 2 at the transition date to retained earnings of 1.2 million after deferred tax of 0.5 million.
IAS 23 Borrowing costs IAS 23 allows the capitalisation of borrowing costs where they are directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset.
However, where borrowing costs are capitalised the treatment must be consistently applied to all borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets.
Dairy Crests accounting policy was to only capitalise interest on major capital projects.
Due to the administration involved in applying capitalisation to all qualifying assets we have amended our accounting policy to expense all interest as incurred and cease capitalisation of interest as part of the cost of qualifying assets.
This has resulted in a reduction in the net book value of property, plant and equipment of 6.1 million offset by the reversal of a deferred tax liability of 1.8 million at the date of transition.
Profit before tax has also increased by 0.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 as a result of this adjustment.
IAS 10 Events after balance sheet date Under this standard the liability for dividend payments is recognised when the dividend is approved.
The normal practice under UK GAAP is for dividends to be recognised in the period to which it relates.
At 31 March 2004 the final dividend for the year of 16.5 million had not been approved by the Board.
In the opening IFRS balance sheet the dividend creditor has been reversed.
Similarly, shareholders equity at 31 March 2005 has been increased by 17.7 million.
IAS 17 Leases Under IFRS lease incentives are required to be written off over the life of the lease.
Under UK GAAP these have been written off over the period up to the first rent review.
The adoption of IFRS has resulted in the recognition of deferred income of 0.7 million and a deferred tax asset of 0.2 million.
The deferred income will be credited to income at 0.1 million pa until 2012.
IAS 12 Income taxes IAS 12 Income taxes covers accounting for both current and deferred taxation.
The adoption of IAS 12 does not in itself result in any restatement of the Groups tax charge.
However, the basis of recognising deferred tax under IAS 12 compared to the UK standard FRS 19 Deferred tax results in deferred tax being recognised on all fair value adjustments recorded as a result of acquisitions.
This has resulted in an increase in the deferred tax asset of 1.5 million in the opening balance sheet.
A summary of the Groups significant accounting policies under IFRS are included in the Accounting Policies note.
Short-term borrowings have been amended to better reflect the maturity of term loans at 31 March 2005.
This has resulted in a reclassification of 20 million from long-term borrowings to short-term borrowings.
There was no impact on net cash flow comparatives, or on cash flow from operating activities comparatives, from the adoption of IFRS.
Under IFRS, the ESOP is excluded from the Parent Company balance sheet.
The Parent Company has no loans to or from the ESOP.
Consideration consisted of cash and the issue of 109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each.
Under UK GAAP the Company took advantage of the merger relief provisions in the Companies Act 1985 and included the nominal value of shares of 27.5 million in its cost of investment.
Under IFRS, the cost of investment is recorded at fair value and an adjustment has been made to reflect the cost of investment assuming no merger relief was taken.
The estimated fair value of shares issued at the date of acquisition was 170.2 million giving rise to an adjustment to the carrying value of the investment of 142.7 million and the creation of a capital reserve of the same amount.
