28 Principal exchange rates The principal exchange rates used in translating foreign currency assets, liabilities, income and expenditure in the production of these financial statements were: Average rate Year end rate 2006 2005 2006 2005 US dollar 1.84 1.82 1.96 1.72 Canadian dollar 2.09 2.21 2.28 2.01 Euro 1.47 1.46 1.48 1.46 29 Contingent liabilities The Group has entered into various deeds of covenant in respect of certain corporate member subsidiaries to meet each such subsidiarys obligations to Lloyds.
At 31 December 2006, the total guarantee given by the Group under these deeds of covenant subject to limited exceptions amounted to 382.1 million 2005: 276.7 million.
The obligations under the deeds of covenant are secured by a fixed charge over investments of the same value at the relevant valuation date and a floating charge over all the investments and other assets of Amlin Investments Limited, in favour of Lloyds.
A floating charge granted to Lloyds by the Company was also outstanding at the year end but has since been released by Lloyds in January 2007.
Lloyds has the right to retain the income on the charged investments, although it is not expected to exercise this right unless it considers there to be a risk that one or more of the covenants might need to be called and, if called, might not be honoured in full.
As liability under each deed of covenant is limited to a fixed monetary amount, the enforcement by Lloyds of any deed of covenant in the event of a default by a corporate member, where the total value of investments has fallen below the total of all amounts covenanted, may result in the appropriation of a share of the Groups Funds at Lloyds that is greater than the proportion which that subsidiarys overall premium limit bears to the total overall premium limit of the Groups Lloyds underwriting.
150 million of LOCs deposited with Lloyds in November 2005 pursuant to the Lloyds deposit trust deeds for Funds at Lloyds were replaced with 150 million of assets on 3 May 2006.
The new debt facility is guaranteed by the Companys subsidiaries Amlin Corporate Services Limited and Amlin Investments Limited see note 24.
The new debt facility for Amlin Bermuda Ltd is secured by a registered charge over a portfolio of assets managed by Aberdeen Asset Management Limited with State Street Bank and Trust Company as custodian see note 24.
As at 31 December 2006 $1.7 million LOCs were issued with an additional $8.8 million of LOCs issued in January 2007.
