GOODWILL The Group Builders DIY merchanting Total m m m Cost At 1 January 2005 304.8 304.8 Recognised on acquisitions during the year 939.2 29.8 969.0 At 1 January 2006 939.2 334.6 1,273.8 Recognised on acquisitions during the year 8.2 8.2 At 31 December 2006 939.2 342.8 1,282.0 Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses during the year was allocated to those cash generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from those acquisitions.
With the exception of the Wickes business, no individual CGU is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
During the year management has carried out an impairment test for the goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets carried in the balance sheet.
No impairments were identified as a result of the review.
All of the recoverable amounts were based on value in use.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: cash flow projections based on management approved budgets for 2007 and three-year plan for 2008 to 2010: the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group of 7.5%: long-term forecast growth rates of 2.5% in line with the average long-term GDP growth trend applied from 2010 onwards.
Whilst management is confident that its assumptions are appropriate, it is possible an impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
However, as they are all inextricably linked it is not possible to determine the impact of a significant change to one or more of them.
The Company has no goodwill.
