The two major defined benefit schemes are the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme the senior pension scheme and the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme the staff pension scheme.
The schemes cover 78% of employees with company provided pension arrangements and are of the funded, defined benefit type providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
Following a full group review of pension scheme arrangements during 2005, from 1 April 2006 members were provided with a choice of paying higher member contributions to continue accruing benefits based on final salary or paying a lower member contribution and accruing benefits based on a percentage of salary which would be revalued each year.
The most recent actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 has been based on the preliminary results of these valuations which have been updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 December 2006.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value at 31 December 2006.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: Group and company 2006 2005 % % Price inflation 3.10 2.80 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.68 4.38 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.10 2.80 Discount rate 5.10 4.80 Long-term rate of return Equities 7.85 7.85 Bonds 5.10 4.10 Index-linked gilts 4.50 4.10 Other 5.25 4.50 Overall weighted average 6.62 6.74 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes are based on the mortality experience of insured pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
For members of the staff scheme it is assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 21 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
For members of the senior scheme it is assumed that members who retire in the future at age 60 will live on average for a further 29 years if they are male and for further 32 years if they are female.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for both schemes, the charge to the consolidated income statement would have increased by approximately 0.4m and the defined benefit obligation would have increased by approximately 20.0m.

From 5 April 2006, changes to the rules of the pension schemes and to the tax applying to pension scheme benefits has meant that in most cases members of the pension schemes will be able to take a larger proportion of their benefits in the form of a cash lump sum at retirement.
Due to the terms under which members pensions are converted into cash lump sums, these changes have led to a 2.2m past service saving relating to deferred members of the pension schemes and a 4.4m curtailment saving relating to active members of the pension schemes.

A further special contribution of 102.2m company 14.6m was made in January 2006 in order to ensure that the defined benefit schemes were fully funded based on the June 2005 deficit position.
The increase in the groups interest payable after funding the deficit is broadly offset by a reduction in the underlying IAS 19 pension charge to the consolidated income statement.
Regular employer contributions to the group pension schemes in 2007 are expected to be 5.5m company 0.4m.
