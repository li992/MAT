NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21.
Financial instruments Financial risk factors Exposure to interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments principally foreign currency forward contracts, options and swaps are used to manage exposure to uctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
It is the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily U. S. Dollars, Euros and Hong Kong Dollars.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk on purchases and, where eligible, these are accounted for as cash ow hedges under IAS 39.
The Group hedges up to two seasons purchases denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange and option contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
All of the contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
Where necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
The Groups policy is to use short-term bank borrowings, interest rate swaps and cash deposits to manage its interest rate risk exposure.
The Group classies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash ow hedges and states them at fair value.
Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: Note Carrying Fair Carrying Fair 2006 2006 2005 2005 m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 17 9.8 9.8 13.6 13.6 Forward exchange contracts: cash ow assets 5.3 5.3 cash ow liabilities 0.2 0.2 0.5 6.3 Trade and other receivables 16 24.2 24.2 28.4 28.4 Trade and other payables 19 125.1 125.1 108.4 108.4 Property rental liabilities 1.5 1.5 Bank overdraft 18 41.8 41.8 44.5 44.5 Comparative balances for financial instruments are reported under UK GAAP.
If IAS 32 39 had been applied, the carrying value would equate to the fair value.
The fair value of forward currency contracts above is determined by reference to contract rate and the market forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The net fair value gains as at 25th February 2006 on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk of purchases are 5.1m.
These are transferred at their current fair value as an inventory basis adjustment on receipt of the underlying inventory.
The total value of forward and option forward exchange contracts outstanding at 25th February 2006 was 182.5m 2005: 167.7m.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract at 25th February 2006 was 20.0m.
At 25th February 2006 the xed rate payable under the swap was 4.8%.
The nature of the swap is such that it does not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly changes in the fair value of the instrument have been taken to the income statement.
The swap expires in October 2006.
The fair value of the interest rate swap at 25th February 2006 was nil 2005: nil.
The fair value of the swap is based on the valuation provided by the financial institutions counter-party with which the swap is held.
