For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume issue of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
At 29th January 2006 and 30th January 2005, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Scheme had not been met and, consequently, the shares in question are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.

8 Goodwill m Cost At 2nd February 2004 45.9 Additions 1.6 At 30th January 2005 47.5 Additions note 23 2.5 At 29th January 2006 50.0 The carrying value of goodwill is 50.0 million, 4.1 million of which relates to acquisitions since the transition to IFRS.
In accordance with IAS 36, the remaining goodwill of 45.9 million for the purpose of impairment testing has been allocated to the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell InOne UK and BuckHickman InOne.
The recoverable amounts have been measured based on value in use.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations, which were performed based on data available at the mid-point of the financial year, were as follows: Sales growth for the current year was based on internal forecasts with growth in the five subsequent years broadly in line with historic UK GDP and a terminal growth rate of 2.3 per cent.
Gross margins were projected based on recent trends.
A market risk premium, of 4.5 per cent, was used in calculating the weighted average cost of capital.
Forecast cash ows have been prepared for a period of five years.
From the second year onwards, the rate of growth used does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the industry in which the business operates.
The cash ows that these projections produce have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5 per cent.
No impairment arose during the year as a result of this test or in respect of goodwill on acquisitions made since the transition to IFRS.

Premier Farnell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 45 Note 15 continued Prior to 31st January 2005, the Companys cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares nominal value 7.6 million were included within shareholders funds and the preference dividend shown as a deduction from profit after tax.
Under IAS 39, such preference shares are required to be split into debt and equity components with the preference dividend being reclassied as a finance cost.
The fair value of the debt element is established on issue of the shares, based on the discounted cashows of the instrument to the date of maturity and is then increased each year on a straight line basis through the income statement in order to arrive at the redemption amount payable on maturity of the shares.
The equity component is 19.9 million and will only change as and when shares are redeemed.
At 29th January 2006, the debt element of the preference shares was 110.2 million 31st January 2005: 106.3 million and the movement during the year is reconciled as follows: m At 31st January 2005 106.3 Premium on redemption 1.5 Exchange movement 2.4 At 29th January 2006 110.2 The preference shares comprise 161,993 2005: 994,033 US$1.35 cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the US preference shares and 7,413,228 2005: 6,581,188 89.2p cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the sterling preference shares and, together with the US preference shares, the preference shares.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the preference shares are as follows: 1 Currency Holders of preference shares are entitled to receive a preferential dividend, a distribution on a winding up and a payment on redemption.
Holders of US preference shares receive such payments in US dollars.
Holders of sterling preference shares receive such payments in sterling.
2 Changeover A holder of US preference shares may serve notice on the Company requiring that some or all of their US preference shares be changed to sterling preference shares.
3 Income a Each holder has a right to receive a xed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of US$1.35 per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and at the rate of 89.2p per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares.
Dividends on the preference shares are payable half-yearly in arrears in equal amounts, on 26th January and 26th July.
b The xed cumulative preferential dividends payable in respect of the preference shares are paid in priority to any dividend payable to the holders of ordinary shares and in priority to or pari passu with the holders of any other class of preference shares in the capital of the Company.
c If a holder of US preference shares has elected to changeover his US preference shares to sterling preference shares then the xed cumulative preferential dividend and any arrears payable after the changeover date will be paid at the sterling rate set out above.
4 Conversion a Each holder of preference shares is entitled to convert all or any of his fully paid preference shares into fully paid ordinary shares at the rate of 10.3432p in nominal amount of ordinary share capital for every 1 in nominal amount of preference share capital so converted the conversion rate.

d The conversion rate may be subject to adjustment if, inter alia, the Company makes an issue of ordinary shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, a rights issue or another offer to ordinary shareholders or if there is a change of control in the Company following a take-over offer or if a capital distribution is made.
5 Redemption The Company shall subject to any statutory restrictions on 29th April 2016 redeem all the US preference shares in issue at US$25 for every 1 of nominal value and all the sterling preference shares in issue at 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value.
6 Voting Each preference share entitles the holder to receive notice of but not to attend or vote at general meetings of the Company save in limited circumstances.
Subject to being entitled to vote on any resolution, each holder of preference shares has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll every such holder has one vote for every ordinary share to which he would be entitled on conversion of his preference shares.
7 Winding up Subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and conditions, on a return of capital on a winding-up of the Company the assets available for distribution will be applied, first, in paying to each holder of a preference share any arrears and accruals of the preferential dividend: second, in repaying US$25 for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares: third, in repaying the capital paid up on each ordinary share: and fourth, in distributing the remainder rateably among the members of the Company according to the amounts paid up on their respective holdings of shares in the Company, each preference share being treated for this purpose as if converted at the conversion rate applicable into fully paid ordinary shares immediately prior to the commencement of the winding-up.

BuckHickman InOne BHIO reorganisation On 27th January 2006, the Group announced a restructuring of its BHIO business.
This comprises a restructuring of the sales and logistics operations under which branches will focus solely on delivering sales and customer service by relinquishing responsibility for procurement, local inventory and logistics.
These activities will be streamlined through the creation of a number of regional distribution centres, supported by the business national distribution centre in Coventry.
The restructuring also includes a review of the profitability of customer contracts and the centralisation of procurement.
The restructuring is expected to result in an estimated gross headcount reduction of 175 positions, the majority of which will occur during the year ending 28th January 2007.
The total cost of the restructuring is estimated at 3.9 million which includes 2.8 million of severance costs, 0.4 million of consultancy costs and 0.4 million associated with termination of customer contracts.
Of the total provision, 0.6 million was incurred during the year relating to contract terminations and consultancy.

19 Financial instruments IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, were adopted prospectively from 31st January 2005.
Consequently, the financial instrument disclosures given below for the year ended 29th January 2006 are in accordance with IFRS, whereas the comparative financial instrument disclosures for the year ended 30th January 2005 are in accordance with UK GAAP for that year.
Disclosure for the year ended 29th January 2006 IFRS The Group is exposed to a number of different market risks in the normal course of business including credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Credit risk The Group has a customer credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Investments are allowed only in short-term instruments and only with counterparties that have sound credit ratings.
Given the high credit quality of counterparties with whom the Group has investments, the Directors do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At 29th January 2006 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset included in the balance sheet.
Hedging interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that there is an appropriate mix of xed and oating rates in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are entered into, where necessary, to achieve this appropriate mix.
At 29th January 2006 the Group was not party to any interest rate swaps 30th January 2005: nil.
48 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Note 19 continued Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the euro and US dollar.
The Group hedges significant foreign currency exposures in respect of forecast sales and purchases of inventory through foreign exchange contracts.
All such forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cashow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movements in exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specically hedge all of its long-term investments in overseas assets.
Estimation of fair values The main methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: Derivatives: forward exchange contracts are marked to market using listed market prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings: fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cashows.
Convertible redeemable preference shares: fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Trade and other receivables payables: the notional amount for trade receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year are deemed to reect their fair value.
Net fair value of derivative financial instruments The Group classies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast trading transactions as cashow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted trading transactions at 29th January 2006 was 0.2 million, which was reected in a hedging reserve at that date.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups US dollar denominated private placement notes totalling $380 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its US subsidiaries.
The Groups euro denominated unsecured loans of 129 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its European Monetary Union member subsidiaries.
The fair value of the US dollar borrowings at 29th January 2006 was 212.9 million and the fair value of the euro borrowings was 19.9 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 12.4 million was recognised in equity during the year on translation of these loans to pounds sterling.
Fair value of long-term borrowings and preference shares The book and fair values of the Groups long-term borrowings and preference shares as at 29th January 2006 were as follows: Book value Fair value 2006 2006 m m Long-term borrowings 167.6 165.2 Preference shares 130.1 116.3 The book value of the preference shares at 29th January 2006 comprises the equity element of 19.9 million and the debt element of 110.2 million.

b Post-retirement medical benets In the US, the Group provides unfunded post-retirement medical benets to certain US employees.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used to account for pension obligations.
The charge for the year was 0.6 million 2005: 0.9 million and the balance sheet obligation at 29th January 2006 amounted to 7.1 million 2005: 5.5 million.
The disclosures relating to post-retirement medical benets are based on an actuarial valuation performed by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Actuaries and Pension Consultants, as at 29th January 2006.
The principal assumptions were as follows: 2006 2005 % % Discount rate 5.5 6.3 Medical ination 5.0 5.0 The assumed long-term rate of medical ination is 5.0 per cent per annum.
The initial rate is 9.0 per cent which is assumed to reduce to the long-term rate at 0.5 per cent per annum over eight years.
The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.

Under IFRS goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and so is not amortised, but is subject to an annual test for impairment.
Thus, goodwill amortisation for the year ended 30th January 2005 of 2.7 million has been reversed.
The annual impairment test under IFRS during the year ended 30th January 2005 did not result in any reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.
62 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Note 29 continued Share-based payments Under UK GAAP companies were required to recognise an expense based on the intrinsic value of the share-based award, being the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the instrument at the date of the award typically the market price, adjusted to reect expected and actual levels of vesting.
All the Groups share options, except the SAYE scheme, have an exercise price equivalent to the fair value at the date of award and, therefore, there was no requirement to recognise any expense under UK GAAP.
SAYE schemes were specically exempt from such a charge under UK GAAP.
In relation to the Groups LTIP, an expense was recognised over the vesting period based on the market value at the date of grant to the extent that shares were expected to vest.
Under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, an expense is recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments, including options and SAYE schemes, over the vesting period.
The expense is based on the fair value of the award at the grant date using option pricing models.
For the Groups share option scheme, as the performance conditions are based on growth in earnings per share, which under IFRS is a non-market based measure, the expense is adjusted to reect expected and actual levels of vesting.
For the Groups LTIP, as the performance conditions are based on share price performance relative to the FTSE mid-250 Index, which under IFRS is a market based measure, the expense is not adjusted other than for forfeitures.
For the SAYE scheme the expense is only reduced to reect forfeitures.
The transitional rules of IFRS 1 allowed companies to ignore awards made before 7th November 2002.
However, the Group has chosen not to adopt this exemption.
Instead, in order to maintain consistency across reporting periods, a full retrospective approach has been followed on all awards granted but not fully vested at the date of transition.
The operating expense arising from the adoption of IFRS 2 for the year ended 30th January 2005 is 2.8 million compared to a UK GAAP expense of 0.4 million.
The charge is eliminated in retained earnings, as for UK GAAP, and thus there is no balance sheet impact other than the associated deferred tax.
Pensions Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
This standard adopted an income statement driven approach which spread the cost of providing benets over the estimated average service lives of employees.
The SSAP 24 discount rate is based on the long-term estimate of the schemes investment return.
IAS 19 is fundamentally different to SSAP 24 and adopts a balance sheet driven approach with market based measures.
The discount rate under IAS 19 is based on the market yield of a high quality corporate bond at the valuation date.
In addition, the Group has chosen to adopt the amendment to IAS 19 revised 2004 from the transition date which allows actuarial gains and losses to be accounted for through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Set out below is a comparison of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes under SSAP 24 and IAS 19, on the income statement for the year ended 30th January 2005 and the balance sheet as at 30th January 2005.
Balance sheet Income statement 30th January 2005 SSAP 24 IAS 19 SSAP 24 IAS 19 m m m m US scheme 5.0 3.3 81.9 44.3 UK scheme 0.7 0.3 20.9 Other schemes 0.3 1.0 1.7 Operating profit net surplus 4.3 2.7 80.9 21.7 Net deferred tax liability 30.3 9.8 Net assets impact 50.6 11.9 Under SSAP 24, there was a credit in the income statement amounting to 4.3 million.
Under IAS 19, this credit is reduced to 2.7 million, reducing operating profit by 1.6 million.
IAS 19 does not require the interest cost and expected return on assets to be presented separately as a finance cost income.
Consequently, the income statement impact has been included in arriving at operating profit, in line with SSAP 24.
The impact of IAS 19 on the UK GAAP balance sheet at 30th January 2005 is to reduce net assets by 38.7 million, including the impact of deferred tax.
The impact excluding deferred tax is 59.2 million, which comprises 20.9 million as a result of including the UK pension scheme liability on the balance sheet which was not required under SSAP 24, 37.6 million relating to the US scheme, the net surplus having reduced from 81.9 million under SSAP 24 to 44.3 million under IAS 19, and 0.7 million in respect of other schemes.
The net pension surplus of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 at 30th January 2005 was 21.7 million comprising the surplus in the US scheme of 44.3 million and the deficit in the UK and other schemes of 22.6 million.
Schemes in surplus and schemes in deficit require separate disclosure in the IFRS balance sheet.
Premier Farnell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 63 Note 29 continued Taxation Under UK GAAP deferred taxation is recognised on the basis of timing differences, being the difference between accounting profit and taxable profit.
IFRS requires deferred taxation to be based on temporary differences, being the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
As a result, the Group has provided an additional 1.4 million of deferred tax liabilities in the transition balance sheet that was not required under UK GAAP relating to the revaluation of properties.
Where required, deferred tax has been provided on the IFRS adjustments.
With respect to share-based payments, the Group receives a tax deduction in its major operating territories at the time of exercise of the share-based instrument based on the gains made by employees.
IFRS requires a deferred tax asset to be established based on the potential future tax deduction available to the Group estimated using the information available at the balance sheet date.
The reduction in the deferred tax asset from the transition balance sheet date to the balance sheet as at 30th January 2005 arises primarily due to the lower share price at 30th January 2005 and has resulted in a deferred tax charge under IFRS of 0.7 million during the year ended 30th January 2005.
Reclassications Under UK GAAP, all capitalised computer software is included within tangible xed assets as plant and equipment.
Under IFRS, only computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware should be included as plant and equipment.
All other computer software should be recorded as an intangible asset.
Accordingly, a reclassication of the net book amount of capitalised computer software of 34.4 million has been made in the transition balance sheet and 28.8 million in the balance sheet as at 30th January 2005 between property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
There is no profit and loss account impact as a result of this reclassication since, under both UK GAAP and IFRS, computer software is written down over its estimated useful life.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are, in certain circumstances, disclosed separately on the balance sheet as non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively.
IFRS requires the element of provisions which are expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date to be presented on the balance sheet within current liabilities as short-term provisions.
The reclassication for each balance sheet presented is 0.1 million.
Ordinary dividends Under UK GAAP, ordinary dividends are accounted for in the period to which they relate even if the approval of that dividend takes place after the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, proposed ordinary dividends do not meet the denition of a liability until such time as they have been approved.
In the case of a final ordinary dividend this approval is by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The final dividend for the year ended 1st February 2004 of 18.1 million has been reversed in the transition balance sheet and charged to equity during the year ended 30th January 2005.
Similarly the final dividend for the year ended 30th January 2005 has been reversed and charged to equity during the year ended 29th January 2006.
Cashow statements The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS does not change the reported cash ows of the Group.
An IFRS cashow statement is similar to UK GAAP but presents various cash ows in different categories and in a different order from UK GAAP.
All of the IFRS adjustments net out within cash generated from operations except for the intangible assets reclassication where the cash used to purchase computer software has been reclassied from purchase of plant and equipment to purchase of intangible assets.
Financial instruments As permitted, the implementation of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, was adopted, prospectively, on 31st January 2005.
Under UK GAAP, convertible, redeemable preference shares are included within shareholders funds and the preference dividend is shown as a deduction from profit after tax.
The fair value of the debt element is established on issue of the shares, based on the discounted cashows of the instrument to the date of maturity and is then increased each year on a straight line basis through the profit and loss account in order to arrive at the redemption amount payable on maturity of the shares.
At 31st January 2005, the debt element of the preference shares was 106.3 million.
The impact of IFRS on the Groups other financial instruments, namely its foreign currency forward contracts, is not significant.
The adjustments set out above are those given in the Groups IFRS announcement made on 4th May 2005, a copy of which can be found on the Companys web site.
