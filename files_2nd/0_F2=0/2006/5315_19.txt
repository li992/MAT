7 Share-based payments The Group has a number of share-based payment plans for employees.
These comprise an Executive Incentive Plan awarded to the Groups senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP awarded to key senior employees, a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme that is made available to the majority of employees and a US s423 option scheme that is offered to all permanent employees in the US operating company.
The LTIOP and SAYE schemes were in operation before 7 November 2002 in addition to a pre-existing Long Term Incentive Plan.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to grants made, under all these schemes, after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
Executive Incentive Plan EIP The EIP scheme is a one-off conditional award on 1 February 2006 of shares to the 12 most senior executives in the Group to be delivered following the financial year ending 31 March 2009.
The number of shares to be awarded is dependent on the performance of the Group during the year ending 31 March 2009 varying between 0 and 2,700,000.
Dividends are accrued during the life of the options.
450,000 of the options have a cash alternative settlement arrangement.
The fair value of the EIP options was calculated using a Black-Scholes model based on the assumptions below.
EIP 2006 Fair value at grant date 300p Assumptions used Share price 300p Expected volatility 39.7% Expected option life 3.25 years Risk free interest rate 4.4% Volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the shares over a three year period up to the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP The LTIOP schemes are awarded to key senior employees at a grant price equal to Groups share price.
The vesting conditions include a continuation of service, a minimum of three years, and the performance of the Groups shares against a comparator group.
The share price is tested against this group after three years and can be retested after four and five years if the options have not vested.
The proportion of the options vesting is also dependent on the comparative share performance.
The share options can be exercised up to 10 years after the grant date.
Any options remaining unexercised after 10 years from the date of grant will expire.
There are currently three LTIOP schemes.
5,264,667 options were granted on 30 June 2005, 4,959,435 options were granted on 30 June 2004 and 6,452,956 options were granted on 30 June 2003.
The fair value of the LTIOP options was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below.

Save as You Earn SAYE schemes The SAYE schemes are available to the majority of employees of the Group.
They provide a purchase price equal the the daily average market price at the date of the offer less 20%.
The French scheme may be offered at a different rate to ensure compliance with French regulations.
The option vesting conditions are the employees continued employment for the three or five year period and the maintenance of the employees savings in an account.
Failure of either of these conditions is deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions to the vesting of the options.
There have been twelve SAYE awards since 7 November 2002.
Four were awarded on 24 June 2005, four were awarded on 30 June 2004 and a further four on 30 June 2003.
The options granted, the fair value calculated using a Black-Scholes model, and the assumptions used, are shown below.
US s423 scheme The US s423 scheme is available to permanent employees of Allied, the Groups US operating company.
The options are granted to those who elect to participate and the scheme has a savings element similar to the SAYE scheme.
At the end of one year up to 20% of the options can be exercised with the remainder exercisable after two years.
The option price is the lesser of 85% of the market value of the shares on the date of grant and the date of exercise.
There are currently two s423 awards outstanding.
