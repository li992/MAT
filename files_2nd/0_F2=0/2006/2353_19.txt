Bovis Homes Group PLC 41 Notes to the financial statements Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 9 March 2007.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 26.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
Diluted earnings per share in the prior year has been restated by adjusting earnings for share-based payment expenses.
This has reduced 2005 diluted earnings per share by 0.2p per share.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Accounting policies Revenue Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts.
Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties and land is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion of the sale transaction.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expenditure.
Net financing costs Net finance costs comprise: interest payable on borrowings, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: interest receivable on funds invested accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: dividend income recognised on the date the right to receive payments is established: and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

Accounting policies continued Taxation Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
Where the derivative instrument, typically an interest rate swap, is deemed an effective hedge over the exposure being hedged, the derivative instrument is treated as a cash flow hedge and hedge accounting applied.
Under a cash flow hedge, gains and losses on the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognised directly in equity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in reserves is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost as deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, this being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Regular reviews of the carrying values of property are completed to assess any impairment in value.
When impairment is identified, the assets recoverable amount is assessed and any shortfall is written off through the income statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less residual value which is reassessed annually of assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation is charged on property in respect of the value of the building.
The basis of depreciation for each class of asset is as follows: Buildings straight line over 50 years Plant and machinery 33.3% reducing balance Computer equipment straight line over 3 years Office equipment 25% reducing balance The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 43 Notes to the financial statements continued 4.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, no adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, and provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the option given that the option contract has not been exercised at the review date.
Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the option, taking account of any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option.
The carrying cost of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.
Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
44 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the parent company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products and services business segment, or in providing products and services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
As the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose.
Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following standards and interpretations were available for early adoption, but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements: IFRS7: Financial instruments: disclosure applicable for years commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The application of IFRS7 in the year ended 31 December 2006 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement as the standard is only concerned with disclosure.
The Group plans to adopt this standard in 2007.
IFRIC8: Scope of IFRS2 applicable for years commencing on or after 1 May 2006.
The application of IFRIC8 in the year ended 31 December 2006 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement, as neither the Group or the Company used its shares as consideration for goods or services during this year, excepting the use of its own shares for reasons of employee remuneration, and which is fully disclosed in accordance with IFRS2.
The Group plans to adopt this interpretation in 2007.

The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost is charged on legal completion of the house sale.
As at 31 December 2006, 9,913,000 2005: 10,520,000 of finance costs had not received a tax deduction.
The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a liability of 5,140,000.
In future years the Group will continue to pay contributions to fund the pension deficit and there will be further movements in the deficit through actuarial gains and losses.
On the basis that such future deficit payments in excess of current service costs will obtain a tax deduction as they are paid, a deferred tax asset of 1,542,000 was included at 31 December 2006.
This deferred tax asset will be recovered and used to normalise the tax charges during these periods when tax deductions for additional contributions are obtained.
