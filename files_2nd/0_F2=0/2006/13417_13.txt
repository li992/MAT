2 Summary of significant accounting policies 2.1 Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted for use in the EU, effective for the year ended 29 April 2006 and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
During the year the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which have an effective date post the financial statements: IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
IAS 1, Amendment: Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures.
IAS 21, Amendment: Net Investment in Foreign Operations.
IAS 39, Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4: Financial guarantee contracts.
IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.
IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds.
IFRIC 6, Waste electrical and electronic equipment.
IFRIC 7, Applying IAS 29 for the first time in hyper-inflationary economies.
IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, Share-based payment.
IFRIC 9, Re-assessment of embedded derivatives.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the above standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Adoption of IFRS 7 requires additional disclosures of capital and financial instruments for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
A summary of the more important group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group prior to 30 April 2005 had been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
The comparative figures within this report for the full year ended 30 April 2005 are restated for IFRS except for IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Full details of the restatement and reconciliations of the UK GAAP financial information for the year ended 30 April 2005 are in note 37.
The preparation of financial statements that conform to IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The annual financial statements are made up to the Saturday nearest to 30 April.
The 2006 financial statements are for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2006 2005: 52 weeks ended 30 April 2005.
52 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.2 IFRS 1 exemptions The Group has adopted IFRS 1, First-time adoption of IFRS for these financial statement and has applied the following relevant optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS.
a Only to apply IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 May 2005 onward.
A restatement of the opening balance sheet for the financial year ended 30 April 2005 has been disclosed within note 37. b To allow business combinations which were affected before the IFRS transition date to be exempted from restatement according to IFRS 3 Business combinations.
In addition the Group has elected to continue its treatment of the goodwill on acquisition of foreign entities before 1 May 2004 as the Companys own asset.
c Not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based payments on share-based payments as all options were granted prior to 7 November 2002. d To apply IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates prospectively, from the date of transition to IFRS, in relation to the consolidated cumulative translation differences on foreign operations.
e To apply IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities prospectively, from the date of transition to IFRS, in relation to changes in decommissioning, restoration or similar liabilities.
The Group has elected to early adopt IAS 19, Amendments to Employee Benefits and the option available that is similar to FRS 17 under UK GAAP.
The adoption immediately recognises any actuarial gains and losses outside of the income statement.
The financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified by revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
2.3 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial information of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent, unless the minority interests have an obligation to make good these losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment in associates includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identified on acquisition.
The Groups share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associate.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Associates do not have coterminous financial year ends.
Bakers Basco Limited has a financial year ending March and Staper Limited has a financial year ending December.
53 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.4 Revenue recognition Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between wholly-owned subsidiaries, after deduction of overrider and other sales related discounts, value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Sales are recognised upon despatch of goods shipped or on receipt of confirmation that services provided have been accepted by the customer, where the sales price is agreed and collectability is reasonably assured.
Shipping and handling costs are included in selling and distribution costs.
Overrider and other sales related discount reserves are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet claims by the Groups customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
2.5 Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products and services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Primary segment reporting reflects the internal management structure and the way the businesses are managed.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories, receivables and operating cash.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities including pension liabilities and exclude items such as income tax and corporate borrowings.
2.6 Other operating income Other operating income consists of rent receivable and royalty income.
2.7 Restructuring costs and other non-trading items Restructuring costs include the restructuring of existing businesses, any related impairments and the integration of new businesses in the Group.
Other non-trading items include the disposal of land and buildings, pension curtailments, and the refinancing of the Group.
These activities give rise to significant incremental one-off items that distort the underlying operating profit of the Group and therefore the ability to measure financial performance.
As a result, restructuring costs and other significant non-trading items are included as a separate line item on the face of the income statement.
2.8 Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the relevant leases.
Lease incentives received are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they relate.
2.9 Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised for the present value of the obligation that arises under the contract.
Where the time impact of the provision is considered to be material, a nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate is used to discount the obligation to its present value.
Other provisions are recognised in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
2.10 Capitalisation of borrowing costs Borrowing costs incurred directly in connection with the issue of debt are capitalised in the balance sheet, reducing the initial carrying value of debt.
These costs are released to the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
54 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.11 Property, plant and equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 7 years Motor vehicles 2 to 6 years Plant and machinery 2 to 20 years Fixtures and fittings 2 to 15 years Short leasehold buildings Length of lease Freehold and long leasehold buildings 10 to 50 years Land is not depreciated.
Interest on borrowings for fixed assets is not capitalised and is taken to the income statement.
Long leasehold buildings are depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives as noted above and the lease terms.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Assets in the course of construction are depreciated when they have been commissioned and brought into operational use.
Commissioning costs relating to the commissioning period for plant where the plant cannot physically operate at normal levels are deemed to be directly attributable costs and thus are capitalised whilst the machinery is run in and equipment is tested.
Other start-up costs are expensed as incurred.
Useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
For leased assets, specific provisions are made for dilapidation or decommissioning if there is a legal obligation to return an asset in a specified condition and a reliable estimate can be made of the cost of fulfilling that obligation.
2.12 Intangible assets Brands Brands have been capitalised and assigned values where title is clear, brand earnings are separately identifiable, the brand could be sold separately from the rest of the business and where the brand achieves earnings in excess of those achieved by unbranded products.
All brands are acquired and these are not amortised as the directors consider that the brands have an indefinite life, and are not written down unless there is permanent impairment in value below cost see note 2.13.
Licence brands are not capitalised.
Brands are reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
55 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.12 Intangible assets continued Research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects, relating to the design and testing of new or improved products or processes, are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs can be measured reliably.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the commencement of the commercial production of the product on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit.
Computer software costs Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Licences Licences acquired other than those which provide the use of a brand are capitalised as an intangible asset.
Capitalised licences are amortised over the life of the licence or over 20 years if they have an indefinite life.
2.13 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
The decision of the directors to adopt indefinite useful lives for brands is based on the stability of the industry and the typical life span of the Groups products many of which have been in existence for more than 100 years.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Cash flows are then discounted at a pre-tax discount rate to provide a value in use.
2.14 Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Grants from the government are recognised at their fair values where there is a reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the Group expects to comply with all attached conditions.
2.15 Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
2.16 Financial assets Financial assets include financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and loans and receivables.
Financial assets are classified at initial recognition and measured at fair value.
Fair value is the transaction price and in the case of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, clearly attributable transaction costs.
The Group has not restated comparatives in the application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 as permitted by IFRS 1, First-time adoption of International Reporting Standards see note 37.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets held for trading are those acquired in the short term and derivatives classified as held for trading unless they are designated hedging instruments, are included in this category.
The policy for hedging instruments is disclosed within note 2.30.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts, which are included within the Group offset arrangement.
56 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.16 Financial assets continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement within selling and marketing costs.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determined payments.
They do not qualify as trading assets and are not quoted on an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method of the time value of money is significant.
2.17 Impairment of financial assets Assets carried at cost If there is evidence of an impairment loss on a financial asset carried at cost then the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
2.18 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial derivatives classified as held for trading unless they are designated hedging instruments, are included in this category.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables are subject to discount if the time value of money is considered material.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of accrued interest, the fair value of any interest rate swap held to hedge borrowings and net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Group operates one main defined benefit pension scheme for its UK employees and two further defined benefit schemes covering most of the Eire employees.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with full actuarial valuations every three years and updates being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
b. Terminations benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchanges for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possible withdrawal: or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
c. Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the profits attributable to the Companys shareholders after certain adjustments.
The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
57 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.20 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Share premium represents the premium received for shares issued over and above their nominal value.
2.21 Taxation The tax charge or credit is based upon the result for the period and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial information.
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
2.22 Share-based payment Long-term incentive plans and other employee schemes, set up since the adoption of IFRS, which are to be settled in shares are accounted for under the guidance of IFRS 2, Share-based payment.
Fair values for equity settled transactions are measured at the date of grant using valuation techniques taking into account non-transferability, exercise restrictions and performance criteria.
The fair value of any awards are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
2.23 Non-current assets liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups and related liabilities are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or that is classified as held for sale and a represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: b is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or c is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

58 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.25 Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial information of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial information are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions, except where hedge accounting is applied, are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Year ended Year ended Principal rate of exchange 1 29 April 2006 30 April 2005 Year end 1.44300 1.47940 Average 1.46450 1.46376 Group companies The accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into pounds sterling on the following basis: i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
This only applies to goodwill from acquisitions occurring after 1 May 2004.
Goodwill arising from acquisitions prior to 1 May 2004 continues to be treated as an asset of the acquirer.
2.26 Post balance sheet events Dividends are a post balance sheet event for the Group and Company.
Interim dividends are accounted for on a cash basis, whilst final dividends are recognised after approval from shareholders.
2.27 Contingent liabilities and assets A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events.
Existence will only be confirmed by the resolution of one or more uncertain future events, which are not wholly within the control of the Group.
It can also be a present obligation whose probable outflow cannot be reliably measured.
The Group discloses contingent liabilities in the notes to the accounts and when a change in the circumstances occurs a provision will be made.
Contingent assets are possible economic inflows arising from past events and who existence will only be confirmed by the resolution of one or more uncertain future events, which are not wholly within the control of the Group.
The Group disclosed contingent assets within the notes the accounts unless the economic inflow is virtually certain and then the asset is recognised.
2.28 Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom precisely equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated earlier in this note.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates.
59 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.28 Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Estimated value and impairment of brands Brands are not amortised, as it is considered that their useful economic lives are not limited.
This policy is appropriate due to the long-term nature of the business and the enduring nature of the brands, which are a key part of the strategy of the Group and are supported by investment on an ongoing basis.
Their carrying values are reviewed annually by the directors to determine whether there have been any permanent impairments in value and any such reductions in their values are taken to the income statement.
Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised on the basis of a detailed assessment of the Groups future taxable profits and this assessment relies on key assumptions regarding future activities.
Pension liability The Groups pension liability, which is assessed each year by actuaries, is based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, inflation and future salary and pension costs.
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes.
Decommissioning provisions Decommissioning provisions are based on the estimated future cost of fulfilling a contractual obligation of restoring the leased asset to its original condition.
These estimates may differ from actual outcomes.
2.29 Financial risk management Treasury policies and management The financing and liquidity of the Group is managed through a central treasury function, which provides a service to subsidiaries.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Groups businesses, whilst managing currency, key commodity and interest rate risks.
Treasury systems and controls have been implemented to ensure compliance with the Groups financing arrangements.
Liquidity risk is managed by a combination of medium and short-term cash forecasting processes.
These processes are designed to ensure that the Group is able to operate within the credit facilities available.
Objectives, policies and strategies The Group has the following treasury risks: Interest rate Liquidity Credit Foreign exchange Key commodity price The Group makes prudent use, where appropriate, of financial instruments and derivatives for example interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage material financial exposures associated with its trading and funding activities and does not engage in any speculative transactions.
The Groups policy is to apply hedge accounting to hedging relationships where it is both permissible under IAS 39, practical to do so and its applications reduces volatility.
However, transactions that may be effective hedges in economic terms may not always qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
Where hedge accounting is not adopted for specific hedging relationships, movements in the fair value of derivative instruments will be immediately recognised in the income statement and may lead to increased volatility.
Whilst the impact is not expected to be significant, the Group will separately disclose the effects of such volatility.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy in respect of exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to use interest rate derivatives in order to hedge, at an appropriate level, interest payable on floating rate borrowings.
It is the Groups policy to maintain a minimum of 60% of term debt at a fixed rate after taking derivatives into account.
The overall percentage of fixed rate borrowings to total borrowings was 77% at 29 April 2006 30 April 2005: 97%.
Where these derivatives meet the effectiveness criteria, they would qualify as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
Details of accounting treatment are disclosed in note 2.30.
60 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.29 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group aims to ensure certainty of funding together with a cost effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that projected net borrowing requirements are met by committed facilities, with a minimum of 50m in unutilised committed facilities.
Details of current long-term borrowings and the facilities are disclosed in note 21.
Short-term funding is managed via offset arrangements and draw-downs under the revolving credit facilities.
Credit risk Surplus cash is invested on short-term deposits with A1 short-term rated credit institutions.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk is restricted to trading activities and is minimal as the Group is mainly UK based and sells mainly to UK customers.
Foreign exchange transactional risk arises from overseas operations and from purchases in currencies other than GBP.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency options to manage this risk.
However it is not a Group policy to hedge the translation of overseas results into sterling.
Key commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises in connection with the purchase of raw materials such as wheat, sugar and utilities.
The Group uses derivatives such as over-the-counter swaps, commodity futures contracts and currency options to manage this risk.
Where necessary these commodity contracts are combined with currency options or forward foreign exchange options to manage the full sterling commodity price risk.
The Group also enters into certain contracts for the physical delivery of raw materials which may implicitly contain a transactional currency exposure, an embedded derivative.
The Groups policy is to take forward cover for forecasted receipts and payments including inter-company transactions in line with committed flows.
2.30 Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The policy applied for derivatives and financial instruments for the year ended 30 April 2005 was FRS 13 UK GAAP in line with the IFRS 1 exemption taken.
To qualify as a hedge the financial instrument had to be related to actual assets and liabilities or constitute a firm commitment or a probable transaction.
Gains and losses were recognised in the income statement at the completion of the underlying transaction or as part of the related asset or liability.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps were recognised as adjustments to net interest income or expense over the period of the contract.
Gains and losses on non-qualifying hedges were recognised immediately in the income statement.
Under FRS 13 when a financial instrument ceased to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event was no longer likely to occur, the instrument would thereafter be marked to its fair value and any loss accounted for in the income statement.
The Group adopted IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 May 2005.
The financial impact on the balance sheet for the year ended 30 April 2005 has been disclosed within note 37.
The accounting policy applied from 1 May 2005 is discussed below.
Derivatives are initially recognised and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
The accounting treatment of derivatives classified as hedges depends on their designation, which occurs on the date that the derivative contract is committed to.
The Group designates derivatives as: A hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or commitment cash flow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
61 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.30 Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where the forecasted transaction or commitment results in a non-financial asset or a liability, then any gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the carrying amount of the related asset or liability.
If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
For the portion of hedges where it is not permissible or deemed impractical to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement and are therefore a financial asset or liability measure at fair value through profit or loss.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the income statement when the committed or forecasted transaction is recognised in the income statement.
However, where an entity applied cash flow hedge accounting for a forecasted or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is transferred to the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of the interest rate swaps and currency swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date if they are publicly traded.
The fair value of the forward currency contracts has been determined based on market forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of bank loans and other loans due in more than one year the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
3 Refinancing On 30 June 2005 each of the ordinary shares of 0.01 were subdivided into 10 ordinary shares of 0.001 each.
On 22 July 2005 the Group issued 172,727,273 new ordinary shares listed on the London Stock Exchange at a price of 2.75, giving total proceeds of 475.0m.
In addition 1,875,000 ordinary shares were issued for 10p, giving total proceeds of 187,500, in order to satisfy the exercise of an option by a former director.
On 1 July 2005, the Company and RHM Group Holding Limited entered into a multicurrency term and revolving facilities agreement arranged and underwritten by Credit Suisse First Boston and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc whereby the lenders have agreed to provide up to 900.0m in four facilities: Facility A, a term loan of 250.0m repayable on 31 July 2008 with an interest charge 70 basis points above LIBOR.
Facility B1, a term loan of 250.0m repayable by instalments by 30 July 2010 with an interest charge 90 basis points above LIBOR.
Facility B2, a term loan of 250.0m repayable on 30 July 2010 with an interest charge 90 basis points above LIBOR.
Facility C, a multicurrency revolving credit facility of up to 150.0m.
Facilities A, B1 and B2 were fully drawn down between 22 July 2005 and 30 August 2005.
The Group used the net proceeds from the issue of new shares and funds available under the new facilities to: Purchase the unsecured subordinated loan notes 457.4m and repay associated accrued interest 14.3m totalling 471.7m on 22 July 2005.
Repay outstanding debt under the senior credit agreement of 98.0m on 22 July 2005.
Redeem all outstanding secured loan notes amounting to 458.3m on 30 August 2005.
Settle prepayment cost of 80.8m on early redemption of certain classes of secured loan notes 75.1m and closing out of an interest rate swap 5.7m in relation thereto on 30 August 2005.
Make a payment of 110.0m to the trustee of the RHM pension scheme on 19 August 2005 and a further payment of 15.0m was made on 24 March 2006.
62 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 3 Refinancing continued The debt redemption costs give rise to a 75.2m charge to the income statement, as the 80.8m cash costs are offset by the release of a 5.6m liability already recognised as the fair value of the interest rate swap.
This liability arose from the recognition of the fair value of the interest rate swap at 30 April 2005 as part of the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on financial instruments.
The early redemption of senior credit debt and secured loan notes gave rise to accelerated amortisation of associated capitalised debt issuance costs of 2.9m in the period year ended 30 April 2005: 4.8m The costs of the flotation were 37.3m, of which costs incurred in issuing the shares amounting to 25.5m have been charged against the share premium account.
Costs of 8.3m incurred in raising the debt have been capitalised and set against the gross value of the debt.
A further 3.5m of costs incurred as a result of the listing exercise, but not eligible to be set against the share premium, have been reflected in restructuring costs, of which 1.1m was recognised in the year ended 30 April 2005, and 2.4m in the year ended 29 April 2006.

These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the perpetuity approach.
Management determined budgeted operating cash flow before restructuring costs and other non-trading items based on past performance and its expectations for the future.
A single group-wide pre-tax discount rate of 9.9% 2005: 10.7% was used for the goodwill and brand impairment testing.
The change in the discount rate used reflects the changes in refinancing that has occurred in the Group see note 3.
A growth rate of 2% was applied to the perpetuity cash flows reflecting growth within the UK as a whole.
Main brands RHMs main brands are Bisto gravy, Hovis bread and flour and Mr. Kipling cakes.
The brands are not separable from the CGU and hence are tested for impairment on a CGU basis.

The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 29 April 2006 were 7.5m 2005: 9.9m.
Losses on forward foreign exchange contracts not designated for hedge accounting of 0.2 have been recognised in the income statement.
The restatement of the opening balance sheet has been disclosed within note 37.
Receipts and payments of contracts will occur in euros, sterling and dollars.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swaps at 29 April 2006 were 645.0m 2005: 170.1m.
At 29 April 2006 the fixed interest rates vary from 4.5% to 4.7% 2005: 4.9% to 6.8% and floating rates are 4.6% LIBOR.
Gains on the derivative financial instruments of 2.9m have been recognised in the hedge reserve see note 29 and are expected to reverse in the income statement during the next four years.
Gains on interest rate swaps not designated for hedge accounting of 0.7m 2005: nil have been recognised in the income statement.
All contracts are in sterling with cash flows occurring periodically over the next four years.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding commodity swaps at 29 April 2006 were 4.0m 2005: nil.
Commodity swaps are not designated for hedge accounting.
As a result the movement in fair value of 0.7m has been charged to the income statement.
Receipts and payments of contracts will occur in sterling and dollars.
Included in the above analysis are borrowings with a book value of 743.8m 2005: 562.7m which are not traded in an open market.
Loans with a book value of 757.2m 2005: 101.4m are fair valued under the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of long-term borrowings excludes capitalised debt issue costs see note 32 which are included in the book value.
For the year ending 30 April 2005, the remaining loans not traded, with a book value of 461.3m, were particularly sensitive to the discount rate used, as the principal and the total interest compounded over the life of the loan were repayable in one lump sum at the end of the period.
In order to establish the fair value of these liabilities, the expected future cash flows were discounted at estimated rates specific to each liability and determined through the consideration of a number of factors including changes in the issuer and the market since issue and the collateral supporting and repayment period of each loan.
A discount rate of 14.5% was applied by taking into account the high coupon payable and reflecting the higher risk associated with these loans as a consequence of the significant debt burden in the Company.
A 1% increase in the discount rate used would result in a reduction of 26.7m in the fair value of the loan as disclosed.
These loans have now been settled due to the refinancing of the Group see note 3.
The fair value of the traded loans of nil 2005: 465.6m is calculated on a mark to market basis.
Short-term financial instruments cash and cash equivalent have a fair value equal to their book value.
In accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, contracts have been reviewed for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.

The offset amounts are as follows: At At 29 April 2006 30 April 2005 Group m m Deferred tax assets: Deferred tax asset to be recovered after more than 12 months 57.6 78.3 Deferred tax asset to be recovered within 12 months 34.2 26.8 91.8 105.1 Deferred tax liabilities: Deferred tax liability to be recovered after more than 12 months 16.6 16.7 Deferred tax liability to be recovered within 12 months 12.0 16.6 28.7 Net deferred tax asset 75.2 76.4 The gross movement on the deferred tax asset is as follows: m At 30 April 2005 76.4 IAS 39 adjustment see note 37 1.7 At 30 April 2005 as restated 78.1 Credited to the income statement 0.7 Recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 3.6 At 29 April 2006 75.2 83 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 23 Deferred tax continued The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows: Deferred tax liabilities: Accelerated capital allowances Total m m At 30 April 2005 28.7 28.7 Credited to the income statement 12.1 12.1 At 29 April 2006 16.6 16.6 Deferred tax assets: Provisions Tax losses of assets Pension liability Total m m m m At 30 April 2005 9.3 95.8 105.1 IAS 39 adjustment see note 37 1.7 1.7 At 30 April 2005 as restated 11.0 95.8 106.8 Credited charged to the income statement 29.6 3.6 44.6 11.4 Recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 0.9 2.7 3.6 At 29 April 2006 29.6 13.7 48.5 91.8 No deferred tax was transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for the deficit in the pension scheme liabilities.
The recovery of the deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of taxable profits.
There are no deferred tax liabilities on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
Such amounts are either reinvested or, if remitted to the UK, are covered by underlying tax credits, resulting in no additional UK tax.
In the event of a sale of the brands at their book value see note 14, there would be no corporation tax payable on chargeable gains arising due to the availability of indexation allowances and capital losses.
The directors have no intention of selling the brands.
In the event of a sale of freehold land at its net book value see note 15, no liability is expected to arise due to the availability of indexation allowances and capital losses.
Company The Company has no deferred tax provision.

27 Share-based payments Group The long-term incentive plan LTIP was introduced in August 2005.
A description of the scheme is included within the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 32 to 38.
Eligibility for the 2005 LTIP award was restricted to the leadership team and above.
Shares granted under the LTIP will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date and subject to continued employment within the Group at that date.
Shares were valued at the market price on the date of grant.
A fair value calculation has been performed for the TSR and EPS elements of the scheme.
Due to limited historical information for the Group, an equal probability method, taking account of the correlation between share price growth and higher ranking positions within the comparator group, has been used for TSR as this is considered to be the most appropriate.
The fair value of the EPS element is the share price at grant date and has been adjusted for dividends.
Dividends do not accumulate on the shares during the vesting period and consequently the calculated fair value is reduced.
87 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 27 Share-based payments continued The following assumptions were used in the fair value calculation: Grant date 1 August 2005 Share price at grant date 2.75 Exercise price nil Number of employees 45 Shares under plan 1,840,530 Vesting period 3 years Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 5.75% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 33% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 49.34% Weighted average fair value of award 1.98 At 29 April 2006 Number Outstanding at 30 April 2005 Granted 1,840,530 Forfeited 70,531 Exercised Outstanding at 29 April 2006 1,769,999 The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payment plans was 0.5m 2005: nil, of which 0.5m related to equity settled share based payment.

In particular, the Group has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for all of its defined benefit plans in the period in which they occur, outside the income statement, in the consolidated statement of recognised gains and losses.
UK scheme The Group operates one main pension scheme for its UK employees, which is a defined benefit scheme.
The schemes assets are held separately from the assets of the Group and are administered by trustees and managed professionally.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was made at 5 April 2005.
Subsequently, a new full actuarial valuation has been carried out for the Group specifically for group accounting purposes.
This was carried out as at 5 September 2005 and has been updated by an independent qualified actuary to 29 April 2006 for the purposes of these accounts.
A provision has also been made for the unfunded pension liability arising in respect of certain employees, whose earnings were above the permitted maximum as defined in Section 590C ICTA 1988.
Company contributions for the next financial year are expected to be 40.0m.
Eire schemes The companies in the group based in Eire contribute to two separate defined benefit plans covering most employees.
The assets of the plans are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The latest actuarial valuations of the plans were as at 1 May 2002 and 6 April 2003.
Other schemes Other companies outside the United Kingdom and Eire operate defined benefit plans or consider that state benefits are adequate.
Full provision is made for liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes, as calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Assumptions The major assumptions used by the actuaries were: At At 29 April 30 April 2006 2005 1 Long-term rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0% 3.2% 2,3 Rate of increase in benefits in payment 3.4% 2.3% 3.25% Discount rate 5.2% 5.4% Inflation assumption 3.0% 2.7% Expected return on assets 6.5% 6.5% 1 Pensionable salary increases are assumed to be nil for the four years commencing 5 April 2005 and the rates shown thereafter.
2 In respect of pensions earned between April 1997 and April 2005 where increases are linked to RPI with a 3% minimum and 5% maximum and pensions earned after September 2005 where increases are also linked to RPI, but with a maximum of 2.5%.
Other levels of increase are largely fixed and are valued accordingly.
Deferred benefits are revalued in a similar way and consistent assumptions are used.
The assumptions are expressed as appropriately weighted averages.
3 The rate of increase in benefits in payment in the year ended 29 April 2006 was 3.4% up to 1 September 2005 and 2.3% thereafter.
90 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 30 Pension obligations continued Assumptions continued The expected return on assets assumption has been derived by considering the appropriate return for each of the main asset classes listed below.
The yields assumed on bond type investments are based on published redemption yields at the balance sheet date.
The assumed return on equities and property reflects an assumed allowance for the out performance of these asset classes over bonds in the long term.
The rates of return are shown net of investment manager expenses but gross of scheme administration expenses.
The mortality tables used in the actuarial valuation were making allowances for projected future improvements in mortality : For active and deferred members: PXA92B1965SC 3 year age rating.
For current pension members: PXA92B1935SC 3 year age rating.
The life expectancies implied by these tables for typical members are: Pensioner currently aged 70: Male 14.2 years Female 16.9 years.
Future pensioner when aged 65: Male 19.8 years Female 22.5 years.
Assets The total assets, the split between the major asset classes in the schemes, the present value of the schemes liabilities, and the amounts recognised in the balance sheet are shown below.

Under the terms of this agreement a further payment of 15m was paid on 24 March 2006.
A formal actuarial review of the UK scheme was conducted by the actuary to the Trustee as at 5 April 2005 to determine funding requirements for current service and repayment of past service deficits.
Using similar assumptions for mortality to those implied by the Companys recent mortality study gives rise to an increase in scheme liabilities of 96.0m over those disclosed in 2005.
This increase, together with an associated increase in deferred tax assets of 28.8m, has been reflected as an actuarial loss within movements on reserves.
The first curtailment item shown above relates to the decision to cease the practice of providing enhanced early retirement terms.
This was previously allowed for within the IAS 19 assumptions at 2 May 2004.
The total current service cost of 10.9m 2005: 21.0m was included in cost of sales 6.3m 2005: 11.3m, distribution expenses 3.2m 2005: 6.5m and administrative expenses 1.4m 2005: 3.2m.
The actual return on plan assets was 336.5 2005: 116.8m.

The pension deficit under IAS 19 is 13.6m higher than the deficit under FRS 17 and so there is a higher associated deferred tax asset under IFRS.
Discontinued results are not separated out on the face of the UK GAAP income statement, but for the reconciliation to IFRS have been shown as a separate line.
This has resulted in a decrease in revenue of 114.
8m, a decrease in gross profit of 18.6m, a decrease in operating profit of 22.8m and an increase in taxation of 3.3m.

Below is a discussion of the main areas impacted by the transition.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Under IFRS, the Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
This standard follows a balance sheet approach which is similar to that of FRS 17 which the Group had adopted in 2004 whereby scheme deficits or surpluses are recognised on the balance sheet.
The income statement expense comprises the current service cost, the interest cost, the expected return on any plan assets and the appropriate portion of any past service cost.
Application of IAS 19 has resulted in a total reduction in reserves of 13m, made up of 2m, representing the difference between valuing pension assets using bid values rather than mid values, and 11m being the present value of future pension administration costs.
The Groups UK GAAP accounting policy was to accrue for holiday entitlements under various union arrangements.
The basis of these arrangements were that in the first year of employment, holiday entitlement was earned but not taken and that the entitlement is paid when employees leave the Group.
These arrangements were no longer available to new employees from 2000 but the liability to employees joining before that date continues to be accrued at current rates of pay.
Holiday accruals were also made in accordance with specific local legal requirements in France.
IAS 19 requires that a liability is recorded for all accrued entitlements for holiday for all employees at each balance sheet date.
The reason that a difference arises between UK GAAP and IFRS is due to different measurement bases under each GAAP.
The impact on the Group is to increase the employee benefits expense in the income statement.
102 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 37 Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued IAS 38 Intangible Assets Goodwill amortisation charged to the income statement under UK GAAP has been reversed, as under IFRS, goodwill is not subject to an annual amortisation charge but instead is subject to an annual impairment review.
Under UK GAAP, purchased software licences were capitalised within tangible fixed assets as part of the computer hardware to which they related and depreciated over their useful economic lives.
IAS 38 requires that the computer software that is an integral part of the related hardware, such as an operating system, is treated as property, plant and equipment.
Software that is not an integral part of the related hardware must be capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life.
The effect of this change is to reclassify certain software licences from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets in the balance sheet and to reclassify the related depreciation expense to amortisation expense in the income statement.
IAS 17 Leases classification and lease incentives The UK GAAP accounting standard on leases, SSAP 21 Accounting for leases and hire purchase contracts, is similar to the IFRS standard, IAS 17 Leases in terms of the classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a finance lease.
Whilst both standards define a finance lease as a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the lessee, SSAP 21 provides a numeric test which does not exist in IAS 17 that was used as persuasive evidence of whether this transfer had taken place.
A consequence of adopting IAS 17 has been that some leases previously classified as operating leases under UK GAAP have been classified as finance leases under IFRS.
Furthermore, lease incentives, which are amortised over a period until the first lease break under UK GAAP, are amortised over the entire lease term under IAS 17, resulting in adjustments.
IAS 12 Income Taxes The first adjustment on the closing balance sheet constitutes the tax effect of the other adjustments resulting in an increased deferred tax asset and a reduction in the liability under IFRS.
This resulted in a credit to the income statement.
The second adjustment on the closing balance sheet arises from a one-off deferred tax adjustment resulting from the recognition of the deferred tax asset on the pension deficit in 2005.
The pension deficit under IAS 19 is higher than the deficit under FRS 17 and so there is a higher associated deferred tax asset and a corresponding credit in the income statements under IFRS.
The adjustment on the opening balance sheet constitutes the tax effect on the IFRS adjustments.
IAS 2 Inventories IAS 2 specifically disallows storage costs to be capitalised that are in excess of costs necessary in the production process before a further production stage.
Hence warehouse costs for finished goods have been removed from the cost of inventories.
Impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 May 2005.
In the preparation of the comparative figures within this report under IFRS, the Group applied the hedge accounting rules of UK GAAP, taking advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS.
Under this exemption interest rate swaps, commodity and foreign exchange contracts that were previously accounted for as fair value hedges under UK GAAP were not measured at fair value within the financial statements.
On adoption of IAS 39 the difference between the financial instruments previously reported carrying value and their fair value has been reflected within opening retained earnings.
IAS 39 requires the Group to recognise transitional adjustments in accounting for its financial instruments.
This affects the treatment of the Groups commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which were previously treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions and were not recognised prior to their date of settlement.
These instruments are considered to be non-qualifying hedging instruments at the date of transition, and have been recognised at fair value.
The effect is to increase the Groups liabilities by 5.8m, with an associated deferred tax asset of 1.7m, giving a net increase in net liabilities at 1 May 2005 of 4.1m.
