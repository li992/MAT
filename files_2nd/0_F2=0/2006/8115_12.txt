Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 35 Directors Remuneration Report continued Performance graph The performance graph below illustrates the total shareholder return delivered by the Group since the IPO, in comparison with the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts.
The Remuneration Committee currently believes that this Index is the most suitable benchmark for comparison purposes as an appropriate industry specific index does not exist.
The Remuneration Committee will consider in the future if there is a large enough number of individual comparator companies which may also form an additional comparator group, but as in 2005, do not believe that a suitable group exists at this time.

Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 2005 the consolidated financial statements are set out below.
The text below describes how, in preparing the financial statements, the Directors have applied International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the EU IFRS and the assumptions and estimates they have made in applying the standards and interpretations effective and the policies adopted in the 2006 financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities as described later in these accounting policies.
Basis of accounting The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best estimate of the amount, event or actions, the actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.
Accounting policies adopted in preparing these consolidated financial statements have been selected in accordance with IFRS.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
Amendment to lAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
IFRS 8 Operating segments effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 March 2006.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 June 2006.
IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairments effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosure on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and overseas subsidiary undertakings.
All intercompany transactions and balances with subsidiary undertakings have been eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 45 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The results of subsidiary undertakings established or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated Income Statement from the date of establishment or acquisition of control.
The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the period are included until the date of disposal.
On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identifiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Fees and similar incremental costs incurred directly in making an acquisition are included in the cost of the acquisition and capitalised.
Internal costs, and other expenses that cannot be directly attributed to the acquisition, are charged to the Income Statement.
Comparatives The 2005 Consolidated Income Statement has been restated to reflect the change in definition of EBITDA.
Losses on termination of subsidiary undertakings of US$1.1m has been removed from EBITDA in 2005.
The 2005 Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense has been restated to include the US$5.5m deferred tax credit on share options, previously disclosed in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Equity, note 26.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of the Company and most of the Groups subsidiaries and the presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar, as the majority of operational transactions are denominated in US dollars.
The exchange rate between US dollars and Pounds Sterling as at 31 December 2006 was US$1.96 1.00 2005: US$1.72 1.00.
The average rate and hedged rate between US dollars and Pounds Sterling for 2006 was US$1.84 1.00 2005: US$1.82 1.00 and US$1.77 1.00 2005: US$1.77 1.00 respectively.
b Transactions and balances Transactions not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary undertakings of the Group during the year have been translated using the spot rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising on the settlement of the transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are recognised in the Income Statement.
Monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary undertaking of the Group have been translated at the spot rates of exchange ruling at the end of each month.
Differences on exchange arising from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are recognised in equity to the extent that the foreign exchange exposure is hedged while the remaining differences are recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial instruments and hedging activities Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either shortterm deposits or cash and cash equivalents.
They are stated at amortised cost using the effective-interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
For interest-bearing assets, their carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and bank time deposits, together with other short-term highly liquid investments.
In the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included as current borrowings in liabilities on the balance sheet.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are all classified as other liabilities and stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For borrowings, their carrying value includes accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised issue costs.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the Income Statement except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 46 In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability, gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement in the same period as the asset or liability impacts income.
If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the Income Statement when the committed or forecasted transaction is recognised in the Income Statement.
However, where the Group has applied cash flow hedge accounting for a forecasted or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is transferred to the Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
Revenue recognition Mobile satellite communications services revenue results from utilisation charges that are recognised as revenue over the period in which the services are provided.
Deferred income attributable to mobile satellite communications services represents the unearned balances remaining from amounts received from customers pursuant to prepaid contracts or subscription fees.
Mobile satellite communication service lease revenues are recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract concerned, which is typically between one and twelve months.
The Groups revenues are stated net of volume discounts which increase over the course of the financial year as specific revenue thresholds are achieved by distribution partners resulting in lower prices.
Revenue also includes income from services contracts, rental income, conference facilities and income from the sale of terminals.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, social security contributions, accumulating annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are performed by the employees of the Group.
Termination benefits are payable whenever an employees employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it has demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees or to provide termination benefits, as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
The Group recognises liabilities relating to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare benefits in respect of employees in the UK and overseas.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare benefits are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are immediately recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in its principal locations.
Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are charged to the Income Statement when the related employee service is rendered.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary deductible differences or tax loss carry forwards can be utilised.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 47 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Research and development Research expenditure is expensed when incurred.
Development expenditure is expensed when incurred unless it meets criteria for capitalisation.
Development costs are only capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to the technical feasibility and commercial viability.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Property, plant and equipment Space segment assets Space segment assets comprise satellite construction, launch and other associated costs.
Expenditure charged to space segment projects includes invoiced progress payments, amounts accrued appropriate to the stage of completion of contract milestone payments, external consultancy costs and direct internal costs.
Internal costs, comprising primarily staff costs, are only capitalised when they are directly attributable to the construction of an asset.
Progress payments are determined on milestones achieved to date together with agreed cost escalation indices.
Deferred satellite payments represent the net present value of future payments dependent on the future performance of each satellite and are recognised in space segment assets when the satellite becomes operational.
The associated liability is stated at its net present value and included within liabilities.
These space segment assets are depreciated over the life of the satellites from the date they become operational and are placed into service.
Assets in course of construction Assets in course of construction relate to the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite and BGAN services.
These assets will be transferred to space segment assets and depreciated over the life of the satellites once they become operational and placed into service.
No depreciation has been charged on these assets.
Other fixed assets Other fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the historical cost less residual values, if any, of fixed assets, except land, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The Group selects its depreciation rates carefully and reviews them annually to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
The lives assigned to significant tangible fixed assets are: Space segment 5-15 years Fixtures and fittings, and other building-related equipment 10 years Buildings 50 years Other fixed assets 3-5 years Gains and losses on disposals of tangible and intangible assets Gains and losses on termination of subsidiary undertakings are determined by comparing net proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses on termination of subsidiary undertakings Gains and losses on termination of subsidiary undertakings are determined by comparing net proceeds with the carrying amount.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill, patents, trademarks, software terminal development costs, spectrum rights and intellectual property.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed each financial year.
a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid on the acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 48 b Patents and trademarks Patents and trademarks are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which are 7 and 20 years respectively.
c Software development costs Development costs directly relating to the development of new services are capitalised as intangible assets.
Costs are capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to a technical feasibility and commercial viability.
Such costs are amortised over the estimated sales life of the services.
d Terminal development costs The Group capitalises development costs associated with the development of user terminals.
For R-BGAN and BGAN services terminal development costs are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which is between five and ten years.
e Spectrum rights Spectrum rights are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over a remaining useful life of 8.3 years.
f Intellectual property Intellectual property is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 2.3 years.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Fair value less costs to sell is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be disposed of.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The carrying amount will only be increased where an impairment loss recognised in a previous period for an asset other than goodwill either no longer exists or has decreased, up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
Any impairment to goodwill recognised in a previous period will not be reversed.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, cash generating units are identified as groups of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cashflows that are largely independent of other cashflow streams.
The assets and liabilities include those directly involved in generating the cashflows and an appropriate proportion of corporate assets.
For the purposes of impairment review space segment assets are treated as one cash generating unit.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005: no evidence of impairment was found.
Leases Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Interest and finance costs Interest is recognised in the Income Statement using the effective yield method.
Transaction and arrangement costs of borrowings are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the borrowings and amortised over the life of the debt.
The accretion of the discount on the principal on the Subordinated Preference Certificates and Senior Discount Notes is accounted for as an interest expense.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined by the average cost method.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 49 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, measured at fair value, includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings as current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Short-term deposits Includes deposits held on call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturity between three and twelve months, with highly rated counter parties.
Provisions Provisions, other than in respect of pension and post-retirement healthcare benefits, are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefits arising from past events and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are not recognised unless the outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation is more likely than not to occur.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised as proceeds received, net of transaction and arrangement costs incurred.
Transaction and arrangement costs of borrowings and the difference between the proceeds and the redemption value are recognised in the Income Statement over the life of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the Balance Sheet date.
Borrowing costs for the construction of assets are not capitalised.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA EBITDA is a non GAAP performance measure used by analysts and investors, and is defined as profit before income tax, net interest payable, depreciation and amortisation.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations and significant debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices and foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to foreign currency risk.
The Board of Directors has delegated to a sub-committee, the Treasury Review Committee, the responsibility for setting the risk management policies applied by the Group.
The policies are implemented by the central treasury department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The treasury department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk by using financial instruments.
See note 30. a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The functional currency of Inmarsat plc is US dollars and the Group generates substantially all of its revenue in US dollars.
The vast majority of capital expenditure is denominated in US dollars.
Approximately 60% of the Groups operating costs are denominated in Sterling.
This exposure therefore needs to be carefully managed to avoid variability in future cash flows and earnings caused by volatile foreign exchange rates.
As a guide the Groups Sterling operating cost base has been relatively constant at approximately 5.0m per month.
The foreign currency hedging policy of the Group is to economically hedge a minimum of 50% of anticipated Sterling denominated operating expenses for the next twelve months and up to a maximum of 100% for the next three years on a rolling basis.
As at 31 December 2006, it is estimated that a movement of the US dollar Sterling exchange rate of 1% would have impacted the 2006 profit before tax by approximately US$1.3m.
ii Price risk The Group is not exposed to significant equity securities price risk or commodity price risk.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 50 b Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
The policy of the Group is to ensure certainty of the interest charge by fixing interest rates on 60 100% of forecast net debt for the next two years on a rolling basis.
Both the Senior Notes and the Senior Discount Notes are at fixed rates.
During 2006, until expiry in December 2006, an interest rate swap for US$150m eliminated the variability of US$150m of the US$250m floating term loan under the Senior Credit Facility.
The Group received three-month US dollar LIBOR on US$150m in exchange for a quarterly fixed rate payment at 3.21% on US$150m.
The amount of debt that is floating is partially offset by surplus cash.
At the end of the year 75% of total net debt is fixed.
As at 31 December 2006, on the basis of past net cash balances, it is estimated that a 1% movement in interest rates would have impacted 2006 profit before tax by approximately US$0.6m.
c Credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, shortterm deposits and trade receivables.
All cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits are deposited with high credit quality financial institutions.
For 2006, three distribution partners comprised approximately 84.7% of Group revenues.
These same three customers comprised 85.9% of the trade debtor balance as at 31 December 2006. d Liquidity risk The Group maintains long-term revolving credit committed facilities of US$300m that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
None of these facilities had been drawn as at 31 December 2006.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The more significant estimates are discussed below: a Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group annually undertakes tests to determine whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets are given in note 14.
For the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill is specifically allocated to CGUs and tested by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU with its value in use.
The value in use calculation utilises an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
In 2005 the impairment test was based on the recoverable amounts of CGUs, determined based on fair value less costs to sell.
Two CGUs have been identified these are Mobile Satellite Services and Other.
It has been determined that goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Inmarsat Ventures Limited represented goodwill of the Mobile Satellite Services CGU only.
Therefore, goodwill has been tested for impairment on the Mobile Satellite Services CGU only.
Using the value in use as a measure, no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill was recognised.
In the opinion of the Directors, there have been no changes in the business strategy that would result in the carrying value of goodwill exceeding its recoverable amount.
b Pension assumptions The Group has applied a rate of return on assets of 7.32% p. a. which represents the expected return on asset holdings going forward.

b On 24 May 2005, Inmarsat Investments Limited signed a US$550m Senior Credit Facility led by Barclays Capital, ING Bank N. V. and the Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The facility is for general corporate purposes including the repayment of the previous Senior Credit Facility and was arranged in connection with the IPO in June 2005.
The US$550m five-year Senior Credit Facility consists of a US$250m amortising term loan and a US$300m revolving credit facility.
The term loan and drawings under the revolving credit facility are initially priced at 120 basis points above LIBOR and thereafter tied to a leverage grid.
The US$300m revolving credit facility is undrawn at 31 December 2006.
The new Senior Credit Facility, in combination with existing surplus cash and the proceeds of the IPO, was used to repay the previous Senior Credit Facility of US$728.0m, the outstanding balance of the Euro-denominated Subordinated Preference Certificates 272.7m and 35% repayment of the Senior Notes in note c. As at 31 December 2006, US$250m 2005: US$250m was drawn down at 3 month USD LIBOR plus a margin of 0.7% 2005: 0.9%.
Effective from 1 December 2006, Inmarsat received the consent of 100% of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility to amend the term loan repayments due in 2007 two equal instalments totaling US$50m and 2008 two equal instalments totaling US$50m to reschedule them to the termination date in 2010.
All other terms and conditions remained unchanged.
c The 7.625% Senior Notes were issued by Inmarsat Finance plc, a 100% owned subsidiary of Inmarsat Group Limited.
The Senior Notes mature on 30 June 2012.
Interest is payable semi-annually in February and August.
In July 2005, the Group redeemed 35% of its Senior Notes, reducing the notes outstanding from US$477.5m to US$310.4m.
During 2006 Inmarsat Investments Limited purchased US$43.6m 2005: US$10m of the Senior Notes for US$45.6m 2005: US$10.5m.
Inmarsat Investments Limited paid a premium of US$1.2m 2005: US$0.3m and prepaid interest of US$0.8m 2005: US$0.2m which was later received back from the trustee Bank of New York.
Taking into account the Groups short-term cash surplus, the total payment of US$45.6m 2005: US$10.5m results in an overall economic benefit to the Group when the premium paid is compared to future net interest charges discounted back to values at that date.
d In November 2004 Inmarsat Finance II plc, a 100% owned subsidiary of Inmarsat Holdings Limited, issued a US$450m face value 10.375% Senior Discount Note at a price of 66.894% and thus received proceeds of US$301.0m.
The Notes accrete semi-annually in May and November until November 2008: thereafter interest is cash paid semi-annually.
The Notes mature on 15 November 2012.

Both Notes which mature in 2012 are at fixed rates.
The US$250m floating draw-down under the Senior Credit Facility was partially fixed by a US$150m interest rate swap which expired in December 2006.
The Group has a US$300m revolving credit facility that has no restrictions and is undrawn at 31 December 2006.
The Directors consider the carrying value of borrowings, other than the Senior Notes and Senior Discount Notes, to be approximate to their fair value.

Acquisitions On 4 September 2006 Inmarsat and ACeS International Limited ACeS announced the signing and completion of collaboration arrangements to offer low-cost handheld and fixed voice services, initially in the Asian market with extended coverage expected subsequently using the Inmarsat-4 satellites.
Under the collaboration arrangements, Inmarsat will assume responsibility for ACeS satellite and network operations, wholesale service provision and product and service development.
ACeS will focus on distribution of MSS products in the Asian land and maritime markets and has become a distributor of Inmarsats BGAN services.
As a result of these arrangements, Inmarsat took over the daily active base of approximately 10,000 terminals operated by ACeS, and 53 employees located at ACeS operational centre in Batam, Indonesia.
Although ownership of the associated assets did not change, Inmarsat has acquired operating control of the assets, and of the process applied to them, and will utilise these to generate revenue.
Inmarsat will pay ACeS a total of US$15.0m over four years, of which an initial payment of US$4.0m was made on completion and a second payment of US$1.5m was made on 30 January 2007.
The arrangements taken together constitute a business combination under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.
Based on the fair values determined by an independent valuer, the consideration paid was allocated to the acquired assets as follows: Fair value US$ in millions Book value adjustments Fair value Net assets acquired: a Space segment assets 5.4 0.8 4.6 b Terrestrial assets 3.2 2.2 1.0 Tangible assets 8.6 3.0 5.6 c Spectrum rights 2.7 2.7 d Intellectual property 0.7 0.7 Intangible assets 3.4 3.4 e Deferred tax 1.4 1.4 Total identifiable assets 8.6 1.8 10.4 f Goodwill 3.3 Total consideration 13.7 Satisfied by: g Discounted value of cash consideration 13.4 Directly attributable costs 0.3 13.7 a Space segment assets will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of 8.3 years.
b Terrestrial assets represent the value placed on non-satellite tangible assets and will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of 2.3 years.
c Spectrum rights represent the value placed on utilised spectrum rights at the date of the transaction and will be amortised over a remaining useful life of 8.3 years.
d Intellectual property represents the value placed on the royalty free use of existing technology and will be amortised over the remaining useful life of 2.3 years.
e Represents deferred tax asset arising as a result of the fair value adjustments.
f Goodwill comprises the difference between the purchase consideration and the fair value of the net assets acquired.
g The consideration of US$15m, payable over four years, has been discounted using a discount rate of 7%, being the estimated average cost of debt to fund such a transaction.
The amount of the acquirees profit or loss since the date of acquisition included in the Groups Income Statement is deemed to be immaterial for reporting purposes.
Management consider that, had the acquisition been effected at the beginning of the period, both revenue and profit or loss attributable to the acquiree would have been immaterial for reporting purposes.

Employee share options and awards In November 2004, the Company adopted the Staff Value Participation Plan 2004 Plan.
219,020 A ordinary shares were granted under the 2004 Plan to eligible Directors or employees of the Group.
As part of the IPO, the A ordinary shares were converted following a 1 for 20 share split into ordinary shares.
Options under the 2004 Plan vested as follows: i 25% granted and held by optionholders vested and became exercisable in July 2005: ii 37.5% of the options granted under the 2004 Plan and held by optionholders vested and became exercisable in March 2006: and iii all remaining options granted under the 2004 Plan and held by optionholders vested and became exercisable from 1 December 2006.
Whenever options are exercised under the 2004 Plan, the holder must pay a fide minimis charge of ?1 for each tranche of options exercised.
A second grant of options over 7,140 A ordinary shares was made under the 2004 Plan to employees in January 2005.
This was made on equivalent terms to the initial grant in November 2004.
A third grant of options over 1,175,240 ordinary shares of ?0.0005 each was approved in May 2005 under the 2004 Plan and granted to employees in June 2005.
No new shares have been issued to satisfy the exercise of these options.
A summary of share option activity for the 2004 Plan as at 31 December 2006 is as follows: Weighted average Shares available Options exercise price for grant outstanding per option Balance at 1 January 2005 62,080 218,720 Granted January 2005 7,140 7,140 Forfeited 2,300 2,300 Balance pre share split 57,240 223,560 Share split 20:1 22 June 2005 1,144,800 4,471,200 Shares issued on IPO 51 Granted 1,175,240 1,175,240 Forfeited 72,275 72,275 Exercised 1,233,270 3.28 Balance at 31 December 2005 41,886 4,340,895 3.28 Granted re Share Incentive Plan 7 April 2006 57,872 Forfeited 75,052 75,052 Exercised 3,517,548 3.71 Exercise re International Sharesave Scheme 699 Balance at 31 December 2006 58,367 748,295 3.60 Exercisable at 31 December 2006 748,295 Exercise Price per tranche 21.00 The weighted average of the remaining contractual life for the 2004 plan at 31 December 2006 is 8.0 years.
In line with IFRS2, Share-Based Payment, the Company recognised US$5.2m and US$6.5m respectively in share compensation costs for the 2006 and 2005 financial years.
Total share-based compensation costs are recognised over the vesting period of the options ranging from one to four years.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 64 Prior to the Company being publicly quoted, the exercise price of the options under the A ordinary shares issued in the 2004 Plan of the Company was fide minimis in nature and post the IPO remains fide minimis in nature accordingly, the fair value of each option is equivalent to the fair value of the underlying share at the date of the grant.
This fair value of US$12.50 per share before any adjustment for the share split in June 2005 was estimated with the assistance of independent advisers, who calculated a range of potential values using analysis of comparable quoted shares, discounted cash flows and comparable transactions.
The fair value within this range was then selected by the Directors using the independent analysis which had been prepared.
For the options granted under the 2004 Plan in June 2005 before the share split, the fair value was estimated by the Directors to be US$30.00 per share.
The US$30.00 was calculated using a similar methodology to the independent advisers as the Directors of the Company continued to believe that the discounted trading multiple approach was the most appropriate.
The Company also operates a Bonus Share Plan BSP and awards were granted on 31 May 2005 with the shares allocated after the announcement of the 2005 financial results in March 2006.
There was an additional grant under this scheme in September 2005 with the same conditions as the original grant.
These awards were made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
The performance conditions attached to the annual bonus plan are non-market based performance conditions.
Details of the operation of the BSP can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The awards vest in three equal tranches following the announcement of the final results for each of the financial years 2006, 2007 and 2008, subject to continued employment.
Dividends will accrue during this period and be added as additional shares upon vesting.
The rules of the BSP provide that the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
It is the intention, however, of the Company to satisfy the awards using shares only.
As the BSP provides free share awards with no market based performance condition attached, and which carry an entitlement to dividends paid in cash or shares during the vesting period, the fair value of the awards is the value of the grant.
This is due to the fact that regardless of the market price at the time the award or shares is made, the total value of shares to be awarded will not change.
In addition to the BSP, the Company also operates a Performance Share Plan PSP where awards were granted on 31 May 2005 in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
The number of shares subject to the award was determined by reference to the price at which the shares were offered for sale upon the listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange in June 2005 of 2.45 per share.
Participants are entitled to receive the value of any dividends that are paid during the vesting period in the form of cash or additional shares.
There was an additional grant in September 2005 with the same requirements except the reference price in determining the number of shares was 3.24 market value of shares on the date of grant.
The PSP shares will not normally be transferred to participants until the third anniversary of the award date.
The transfer of shares is dependent upon the performance condition being satisfied over the three consecutive financial years starting in the financial year the award date falls which was 2005.
The rules of the PSP provide that the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
It is the intention, however, of the Company to satisfy the awards using shares only at the end of the three year period unless a participant leaves and is entitled under the Rules to receive a proportionate award and the performance condition has been met.
The performance condition is based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to constituents of the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts and a non-market based condition, based on EBITDA measured over a three year period.
The vesting schedule for PSP awards is structured so that the shape of the vesting schedule is determined by both TSR and EBITDA performance.
The market based performance condition has been incorporated into the valuation.
The fair value of the allocation and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Performance Share Plan Grant date 31 May 2005 29 September 2005 Grant price 1.96 3.24 Exercise price nil nil Bad leaver rate 0% 0% Vesting period 3 years 3 years Expected correlation between any pair of shares in PSP comparator group 12% 10% Volatility 36% 34% Fair value per share option 1.34 2.20 Both the BSP and PSP share awards expire ten years after date of grant.
The weighted average of the remaining contractual life for both the BSP and PSP share awards at 31 December 2006 is 8.4 years.
Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2006 65 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The Company also operates a UK Sharesave Scheme for which the first invitation was made in June 2005.
The Sharesave Scheme is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme open to all UK PAYE-paying permanent employees.
The maximum that can be saved each month by an employee is 250.
Savings over the period plus interest may be used to acquire shares at the end of the savings contract.
The options have been granted with an option price of 2.24 per ordinary share a 20% discount to market value of the shares on the invitation date 23 June 2005.
The Scheme operates with a three year savings contract.
Options are exercisable for a period of up to six months following the end of the three year savings contract and under certain circumstances if an employee leaves the Group.
No dividends are accumulated on options during the vesting period.
The Company also operates an International Sharesave Scheme which mirrors the operation of the UK Sharesave Scheme as closely as possible.
However, instead of receiving a share option, participants receive the spread between the share price at the end of the vesting period and the exercise price, delivered at the Companys discretion in cash or shares.
It is the Companys intention to satisfy the awards using shares only.
Options under the UK and International Sharesave Schemes expire after a maximum of 3.5 years following the initial savings payment having been made.
The weighted average of the remaining contractual life for the UK and International Sharesave Schemes at 31 December 2006 is 2.1 and 2.3 years respectively.
Options under both the UK and International Sharesave Schemes have been valued using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: Sharesave Sharesave Scheme Scheme UK International Grant date 21 July 2005 19 October 2005 Market price at date of Grant 3.14 2.80 Exercise price 2.24 2.24 Bad leaver rate 5%pa 5%pa Vesting period 3 years 3 years Volatility 35% 34% Dividend yield assumption 3.6% 2.8% Risk free interest rate 4.25% 4.25% Fair value per option 1.10 0.90 The historical volatility is based on the constituents of the FTSE 350 Telecoms Service Index, which was measured over three years to each of the grant dates.
The volatility assumption used for each of the awards is based on median volatility for the constituents of the sector.
An award under the UK Share Incentive Plan SIP was made on 7 April 2006.
The SIP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved plan open to all UK permanent employees and operates in conjunction with a UK tax-resident trust which holds shares on behalf of participating employees.
The market value per ordinary share at the date of the award was 3.773.
Arrangements were put in place for eligible overseas employees to replicate the SIP as closely as possible.
Additional arrangements have also been put in place for employees to acquire shares over the capped amounts under the approved SIP.
Under both these arrangements, in aggregate 57,872 ordinary shares of 0.0005 each were awarded to these employees from the Inmarsat Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust on 7 April 2006.
The same market value per ordinary share was used as for the SIP.
A second award under the SIP has been approved by the Remuneration Committee and the Board and will be made in April 2007 to staff employed both on 31 December 2006 and 31 March 2006.
