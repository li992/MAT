b Transitional adjustment on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 as at 1 May 2005.

One of the key effects relates to the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value.

For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value and is therefore not included in the table below for 2006.

DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 91 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued The Group holds options to acquire equity interests in certain businesses.
Such instruments are described in note 12. d Hedging activities The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies by entering predominantly into forward foreign exchange currency contracts.
It also uses swaps, forward exchange contracts and options to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange translation exposure.
The Group designates financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows: Cash flow hedges The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its transactional exchange rate exposures.
These contracts are designed to cover exposures ranging between one month and one year.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and which have been deferred in equity amounts to a 2.1 million loss.
Amounts of 4.4 million and 7.8 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into the income statement, respectively, in respect of contracts matured in the period.
Fair value hedges At 29 April 2006 the Group had interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of 300 million whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125 per cent and pays a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread on the notional amount with a November 2012 maturity.
The swaps are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of the Guaranteed Bonds.
The Guaranteed Bonds and the swaps have the same critical terms.
The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as fair value hedges is 4.4 million.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations At 29 April 2006 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
The fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges is a 8.5 million loss.
e Interest rate profile of financial assets and financial liabilities by currency The following table sets out the interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
The financial instruments not included in the table for 2006 are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
