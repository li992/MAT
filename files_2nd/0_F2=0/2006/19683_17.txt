The benefits of any tax planning are not recognised by the group until the outcome is agreed with HM Revenue & Customs.
Earnings per share The groups share option schemes are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments as it is the groups practice not to issue new shares in satisfaction of employee options.
The potential dilutive effect on earnings per share on the assumption that such shares were to be issued is set out below: 2006 2005 Number of Number of shares shares Weighted number of shares in issue 120,628,368 120,397,435 Weighted number of dilutive shares 76,550 120,704,918 120,397,435 2006 2005 m m Earnings basic and diluted 74.4 66.7 2006 2005 pence pence Basic earnings per share 61.6 55.4 Diluted earnings per share 61.6 55.4 Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust are excluded from the above calculations.
In calculating diluted earnings per share, earnings have been adjusted for changes which would have resulted from the option being classified as equity settled.
The number of shares included in the calculation has also been adjusted accordingly.
The calculations show that the majority of shares under option have no dilutive impact on earnings per share.

Following discussions with the bank, it is anticipated that this facility will be renewed on similar or more favourable terms.
There are no unusual or onerous bank covenants.
Borrowings continued Most of the interest rate swaps are extendable at the banks option: therefore, the tables above show the dates of normal termination and extended termination.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The group manages its interest rate risk through interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing two-thirds of its floating rate debt.
Typically, interest rate swaps have a maturity of 3 to 5 years at inception and the majority are in the form of knock-out options.
The groups finance strategy is discussed in more detail in the business review.
The counter-parties to all derivative financial instruments are UK and European banks, most of whom also lend to the group.
Credit risk exposure is therefore felt to be minimal.

Pensions The group operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members.
The income statement charge was 0.5m 2005: 0.6m for the defined benefit section and 0.3m 2005: 0.2m for the defined contribution section.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5th April 2005, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 26,025,000.
The valuation was performed using the projected unit method.
The main actuarial assumptions were: Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 6.3% p. a. post-retirement 4.8% p. a.
Increase in pensions 2.9% p. a. Capped to 4.9% for certain members.
The valuation showed a funding level of 95%.
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was updated to 30th November 2006 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2006 2005 2004 Rate of increase in salaries 5.1% 4.8% 4.8% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.1% 2.8% 2.8% Rate of increase in pensions in payment Pre-6 April 1997 benefits 3.0% 2.8% 2.8% Post-5 April 1997 benefits 3.1% 2.8% 2.8% Discount rate 5.0% 4.9% 5.3% Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.8% 2.8% The mortality rates adopted are from the PA92 year of birth and medium cohort tables which assume that, for example, male members who are currently retired are expected to draw their pensions for 24.9 years and non-retired members for 27.1 years, based on the normal retirement age of 65.
The group expects to make contributions of 0.8m to the defined benefit section of the pension scheme in 2007.

Transition from UK GAAP to IFRS These are the groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Accounting policies section sets out the accounting policies that have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30th November 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 30th November 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 30th November 2004 the groups date of IFRS transition.
In preparing the opening IFRS balance sheet and the comparative information, the group has adjusted amounts previously reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the groups financial performance and financial position is set out below: a Equity reconciliation 30th 30th November November Explanatory 2004 2005 note m m UK GAAP equity shareholders funds 267.4 330.7 Revaluation of investment properties L 16.0 18.7 Revaluation of derivatives C, P 0.8 0.5 Pension fund actuarial gains and losses A, R 0.6 0.2 Development profit recognition Q 0.3 1.0 Employee share option valuation B, S 0.6 0.4 Lease incentive recognition N 0.2 0.3 Dividends declared but not paid O 6.1 7.1 Taxation on revaluations M 24.2 29.5 Other tax adjustments T 0.9 0.4 Share of joint venture IFRS adjustments U 1.7 6.8 IFRS equity shareholders funds 262.4 320.4 92 Notes to the accounts continued 23.
Transition from UK GAAP to IFRS continued b Profit reconciliation Year to Explanatory 30th November 2005 note m UK GAAP profit attributable to equity shareholders 34.6 Revaluation of investment properties L 24.3 Revaluation of derivatives C, P 0.3 Pension fund net income R 0.4 Development profit recognition Q 0.7 Employee share option valuation B, S 0.2 Lease incentive recognition N 0.1 Taxation on above adjustments M, T 6.7 Share of joint venture IFRS adjustments U 12.8 IFRS profit attributable to equity shareholders 66.7 IFRS 1 First time adoption decisions IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards provides certain choices on transition to IFRS.
The significant decisions made by the group under IFRS 1 are set out below: A.
Employee benefits The group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to its defined benefit pension scheme through equity at the date of transition to IFRS.
Actuarial gains and losses arising after the date of transition to IFRS will also be recognised in full in accordance with the Amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
B. Share-based payment transactions The group has elected to apply IFRS 2 Share-based payments to all share options not exercised at the date of transition.
C. Comparative information IAS 32 and IAS 39 The group has decided not to take the exemption allowed by IFRS 1 in relation to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
As a result, these two standards have been applied from the date of transition to IFRS.
This decision was taken to ensure consistency between accounting policies for the years to 30th November 2005 and 30th November 2006.
The group has not adopted hedge accounting in relation to existing interest rate swaps.
A significant proportion of the groups swaps are not classified as effective under IAS 39 and therefore hedge accounting has not been applied.
Reclassification adjustments In preparing its financial statements under IFRS a number of presentational adjustments have been made as set out below: D. Revaluation reserves As investment property revaluation movements are now reflected through the income statement, the balance on the revaluation reserve recorded under UK GAAP has been reclassified as retained earnings.
Transition from UK GAAP to IFRS continued E. Leasehold investment property Under IAS 40 Investment Property leasehold investment property held under operating leases may only be held at valuation if the head lease is classified as a finance lease.
Under IAS 17 Leases the net present value of guaranteed minimum lease rental payments is included in the value of leasehold properties.
The resultant liability is disclosed as current non-current payables as appropriate.
As a result of this change the guaranteed minimum head lease cost previously disclosed within property outgoings under UK GAAP is now reclassified as a finance cost.
F. Investment property held for resale Under UK GAAP all investment properties were held in tangible fixed assets.
IFRS 5 Noncurrent assets held for resale and discontinued operations creates a new category of asset that is neither a current asset nor a non-current asset.
Investment properties that are in the process of being sold are moved to this new category and shown separately on the balance sheet.
There were no such assets at 30th November 2006 or 30th November 2005.
G. Dividends Under UK GAAP dividends were shown in the profit and loss account.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements states that dividends payable are shown in equity.
A dividend line is therefore not included on the face of the income statement.
H. Share of profit from joint ventures and associates The groups share of profit and losses of joint ventures was formerly reflected in the group profit and loss account as part of turnover, operating profit, interest and tax.
Under IAS 1 the post-tax result of the joint ventures and associates is shown as a single line entry in arriving at profit before interest and tax.
The UK GAAP comparative figures have been reclassified to reflect this change.
Creditors IAS 1 states that current tax payable and financial liabilities should be shown separately as line items in the balance sheet.
These items have therefore been split out from creditors and shown separately.
Cash flow statement The transition to IFRS has no impact on the cash generation of the business.
However, the format of the cash flow statement is different under IAS 7 Cash flow statements.
IAS 7 only allows three classifications of cash flow being operating, investing and financing.
As a result the cash flow items disclosed under UK GAAP have been reclassified under the most appropriate heading.
The IFRS adjustments made to profit before interest and tax in the income statement are reflected within the reconciliation of profit before interest and tax to cash flows from operating activities.
K. Minority interests Under UK GAAP minority interests were presented as part of net assets.
Under IFRS minority interests are reclassified and shown as part of total equity.
Changes affecting the reported result or net assets In restating its comparative financial statements under IFRS a number of adjustments have been made which impact either the reported profit or net assets of the group as set out below: L. Investment properties Investment properties continue to be held at valuation but the revaluation movement and attendant deferred tax, see below are now reflected in the income statement.
Under UK GAAP revaluations but with no deferred tax were reflected through equity.
Under UK GAAP the company had carried land and buildings acquired for undetermined future use at cost within stocks.
Under IAS 40, such assets are included within the definition of investment property.
As a result assets meeting the definition have been reclassified from stock to investment property and have been valued by King Sturge & Co, Chartered Surveyors.
Where such assets are sold without being developed, the resulting profit has been classified within gains on investment property disposals in the IFRS financial statements.
In the UK GAAP financial statements such transactions were included within property development profits.
94 Notes to the accounts continued 23.
Transition from UK GAAP to IFRS continued M. Deferred tax on investment property revaluation Under UK GAAP no deferred tax was recognised in respect of the unrealised surplus on the revaluation of investment property unless there was a binding contract to sell the property at the balance sheet date.
In addition, no provision was made for Capital Gains Tax on the disposal of properties where the gain was deferred through the application of capital gains rollover relief as no liability was expected to crystallise.
IAS 12 Income Tax states that deferred tax must be provided on all temporary differences between the tax base cost and the carrying value of assets.
As a result a deferred tax liability has been recognised relating to the revaluation of investment properties and gains previously rolled over, through equity at the date of transition and through the income statement thereafter.
N. Lease incentives Under UK GAAP lease incentives, including rent-free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the income statement over the period to the first rent review set out in the lease.
Under SIC 15 the period over which the incentive is allocated is revised to be the lease term.
Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP dividends were accrued and shown as a liability when they were proposed.
They were therefore accounted for in the period to which they related.
IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date states that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be shown as a liability.
As a result, the liability for proposed dividends has been reversed.
Final dividends will now only be recognised when they are approved at the AGM and interim dividends when they are paid.
P. Interest rate derivatives Under UK GAAP the groups interest rate derivatives were not carried on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 the derivatives are stated at fair value and disclosed as current non-current assets liabilities as appropriate.
Remeasurements of the derivatives are reflected in the income statement.
Deferred tax is provided on the remeasurements.
Construction contracts Under UK GAAP the group had elected to carry all property being developed with a view to sale at cost with full profit recognised when the asset was sold.
Under IAS 11 Construction Contracts the group now recognises profit in respect of construction contracts for pre-sold projects using the stage of completion method.
Provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty, income and profit on such contracts is now recognised in proportion to the costs.
The project is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus recognised profit less payments received on account.
This revised profit recognition generates consequent adjustments to tax and minority interests.
R. Defined benefit pension scheme Under UK GAAP the cost of the defined benefit pension scheme was charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the variations in pension cost, which were identified as a result of actuarial valuations, over the service lives of employees so that the pension cost was a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable pay.
Under IAS 19 actuarial gains and losses arising are recognised in full.
Actuarial variations in the scheme will be recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense with the regular pension cost and net finance cost related to the scheme reflected in the income statement.
There are consequent adjustments to deferred and current tax.
Transition from UK GAAP to IFRS continued S. Employee share option scheme Under UK GAAP the groups exposure to its share option schemes was remeasured at each balance sheet date based on the difference between the average share price in the three months prior to the period end and the exercise price of the option.
Under IFRS 2 the liabilities arising from the grant of share options have been evaluated using a Black Scholes option pricing model.
T. Tax An adjustment has been made to the tax charge to reflect the tax effect of the IFRS adjustments where necessary.
Investments in joint ventures and associates In assessing the impact of IFRS on the group, the impact on the groups joint ventures and associates has also been assessed.
There is no impact on the amounts recorded for associated undertakings.
The amounts recorded in respect of joint ventures have been adjusted accordingly in respect of the groups share of the above adjustments which apply to the joint ventures.
