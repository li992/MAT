the platinum, Some 250 years on from its powering However, real technological alternatives In South Africa, Anglo Platinum, diamond, coal, base of the Industrial Revolution, coal looks are opening up new pathways to a near the world leader in platinum, metals and iron ore set to remain a vital part of the energy zero emissions environment.
Through a with considerable platinum mix.
Global energy demand is expected combination of new, super ef cient coal projects that are reserves, is implementing its to rise by 2% a year meaning energy red boilers for power generation and extensive suite of projects to under development, consumption will double in 35 years.
carbon capture and storage, it is expand and maintain production, total $6.9 billion Since the start of the decade, coal has estimated that coals emissions can be with $1.6 billion approved in enjoyed one of the fastest rates of cut by more than 80%.
Against a background of growth of all fuels.
Global coal use is positive fundamentals for the forecast to increase by 1.4% every Anglo American is building a more entire range of platinum group year until 2030, with two thirds of this sustainable energy future and ensuring metals PGMs, the company increase coming from China and India.
