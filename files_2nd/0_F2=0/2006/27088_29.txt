At 30 April 2006 the Company had a potential deferred tax asset of 1,740,000 2005 1,892,000 on taxable losses which are available to be carried forward and offset against future taxable pro ts.
A deferred tax asset has not been provided on these losses as it is considered unlikely that the Company will make taxable revenue pro ts in the future and it is not liable to tax on its capital gains.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and, the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
