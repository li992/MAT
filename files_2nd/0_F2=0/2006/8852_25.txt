- Johnson Matthey 68 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 12 Share-based payments Share options Equity settled share options are granted to employees at the market value of the companys shares at the time of grant and are subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options are granted is based on a percentage of the employees salary and since 2001 approximately 800 employees have been granted options each year.
Options granted in 2004 onwards are subject to a minimum three year performance target of earnings per share EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets are EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets are not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options will lapse.
Also, gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Options granted in 2001 to 2003 can only be exercised if the normalised EPS has grown by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the options.
That target has not been met and none of these option grants is yet exercisable.
They are subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Some options granted in 2000 and before are still outstanding.
These were subject to a performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 2% over the three year performance period.
Since that target has been met all these options are exercisable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, shares are allocated to directors and certain key executives of the group based upon a percentage of salary and are subject to performance conditions over a three year period.
At 31st March 2006, shares allocated in 2003, 2004 and 2005 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
For allocations made in 2004 onwards the release of shares is subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR compared to those companies ranked 51 to 150 in the FTSE index over a three year period.
All shares are released if the company ranks in the 75th percentile or above.
Between 35% and 100% of the shares are released on a straight line basis if the company ranks between the 50th and 75th percentiles.
No shares are released if the company ranks in the 50th percentile or below.
In addition EPS growth must be at least equal to UK RPI plus 2% per annum over the three year performance period before any release is made.
For allocations made prior to 2004, 50% of the allocation is subject to the relative TSR target described above.
For the remaining 50%, release is subject to absolute TSR growth over the three year period.
All shares are released if the absolute TSR growth is 45% or more.
Pro-rata allocations on a straight line basis of between 50% and 100% are released if absolute TSR growth is between 30% and 45%.
Half of the allocated shares are released if TSR growth is 30%.
No shares are released if growth is below 30%.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK and overseas Under the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of basic pay each month, subject to a 125 per month limit.
The plan trustees buy shares partnership shares at market value each month with the contributions.
For each partnership share purchased, the group purchases two shares matching shares which are allocated to the employee.
In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years from the date of allocation, the linked matching shares are forfeited.
In the overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time.
401k approved savings investment plans 401k plans In the US there are two 401k plans, one for salaried employees and one for hourly employees.
Salaried employees may contribute up to 50% of their base pay and hourly up to 20% of their base pay, both subject to a statutory limit.
Salaried employees choosing Johnson Matthey Plc shares matching are matched 100% of the first 4% contributed and hourly employees are matched 50% of the first 2% contributed.
Employees may contribute after one month of service and are eligible for matching after one year of service.
Further details of the directors remuneration under share-based payment plans are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 51.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 - 69 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 12 Share-based payments continued Details of share options outstanding at the end of the year are: 2006 2006 2005 2005 Weighted Weighted average average Number of remaining life Number of remaining life options years options years Range of exercise price 300 pence to 400 pence 1,126 3.0 3,057 2.4 400 pence to 500 pence 307 3.3 486 4.3 500 pence to 600 pence 218,243 2.8 568,889 3.7 600 pence to 700 pence 952 1.5 3,342 2.4 800 pence to 900 pence 4,665,693 7.4 5,059,372 8.4 900 pence to 1,000 pence 284,162 4.3 652,906 5.3 1,000 pence to 1,100 pence 3,019,169 8.2 994,290 6.3 8,189,652 7.5 7,282,342 7.5 The fair value of share options granted during the year was 192.4 pence per option 2005 162.1 pence per option.
An adjusted Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to determine the fair value of the options granted.
The inputs to the model were: 2006 2005 Share price 1,070p 892p Exercise price 1,070p 892p Expected volatility 27.1% 33.9% Expected option life 5 years 5 years Expected dividend rate 2.59% 2.96% Risk free interest rate 4.260% 5.105% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the companys share price over the previous three years.
The expected option life takes into account the effects of expected early exercise, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on the history of previous option grants.
Given the low employee turnover and the consistency of the historical average option life Black-Scholes is considered to be a suitable stochastic model to use for fair valuing Johnson Mattheys share options.
During the year 423,030 2005 457,974 shares were allocated under the LTIP with a fair value at allocation date of 389.5 pence per share allocation 2005 346.7 pence per share allocation.
The fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with a zero exercise price, a share price at date of allocation of 1,002.5 pence 2005 897 pence and an expected dividend rate of 2.76% 2005 2.94%.
The fair value was adjusted to take account of the TSR performance condition.
Activity relating to the LTIP was: 2006 2005 Number of Number of allocated allocated shares shares Outstanding at the start of the year 1,205,842 1,165,749 Allocated during the year 423,030 457,974 Forfeited during the year 29,626 67,865 Expired during the year 377,252 350,016 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,221,994 1,205,842 281,921 2005 351,607 matching shares under the SIP and 91,595 2005 92,217 shares under the 401k plans were allocated to employees during the year.
They are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
The total expense recognised during the year in respect of equity settled share-based payments, taking into account expected lapses due to leavers and the probability that EPS performance conditions will not be met, was 7.6 million 2005 7.0 million.
- Johnson Matthey 70 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 13 Post-employment benefits 13a Group The group operates a number of post-employment benefits plans around the world, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was 2.9 million 2005 2.6 million.
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US.
The pension plans are final salary plans except for the US hourly plan which is a fixed benefit based upon years of service.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2003 for the main UK pension plan and 30th June 2005 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2006 by qualified independent actuaries.
A full triennial actuarial valuation as at 1st April 2006 for the main UK pension plan will be carried out in 2006 07.
The main assumptions were: 2006 2006 2006 2005 2005 2005 UK plans US plans Other plans UK plans US plans Other plans %%% %%% Rate of increase in salaries 4.40 4.25 3.57 4.30 4.25 3.41 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.90 2.31 2.80 2.12 Discount rate 4.90 5.75 4.66 5.40 5.75 4.51 Inflation 2.90 2.75 2.66 2.80 2.75 2.42 Current medical benefits cost trend rate 6.90 10.00 5.80 9.50 Ultimate medical benefits cost trend rate 6.90 5.00 5.80 5.00 The group uses certain mortality assumptions when calculating plan obligations.
The current mortality assumptions for all major plans retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
The mortality tables used for the groups largest plan, which is in the UK, were PMA92C03 with a one year age rating for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C03 with a one year age rating for female members retiring in normal health.

Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2006 2005 2006 2005 million million million million Catalysts Synetix 193.9 192.2 132.2 132.2 Research Chemicals 21.3 21.3 Johnson Matthey Tennessee 21.5 19.7 Davy Process Technology Limited DPT 21.9 Other Catalysts 5.9 5.7 Precious Metal Products 2.1 1.9 Pharmaceutical Materials Macfarlan Smith 116.0 116.0 116.0 116.0 Pharma Services Ireland 19.4 18.1 Ceramics 0.4 0.2 402.4 375.1 248.2 248.2 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions including market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, the likelihood and timing of new product launches, foreign exchange rates, precious metal prices and other direct input costs.
Market share, changes in selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the three years.
New product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Apart from as discussed below, it is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.3% 2005 11.3%, 2004 11.4%, as this is considered to be a discount rate a typical third party purchaser would also use to value the significant CGUs.
For Synetix the long term average growth rate is 5% 2005 5% and these extrapolated cash flows are further adjusted to take into account the expected long term cash flows of its gas to liquids business.
For Research Chemicals the long term average growth rate is 4% 2005 4%, for Johnson Matthey Tennessee 3% 2005 3%, for DPT 3% and Macfarlan Smith 6% 2005 6%.
For Pharma Services Ireland, where its cash flows are expected to grow significantly due to new prostaglandin product launches over the next few years, cash flow projections cover a six year period and then a long term average growth rate of 6% 2005 6% is used to extrapolate these cash flows.
If some of these product launches do not happen as expected an impairment loss may arise.

Market risk includes currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
The group and parent company do not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
The group and parent company adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1st April 2005 without restating prior periods.
Consequently, the accounting policies under UK GAAP have been used for the year ended 31st March 2005 and therefore the comparative information for 2005 is shown separately after the 2006 information.
Under UK GAAP the parent company is exempt from disclosing information on financial instruments.
27a Interest rate risk 2006 The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly on a currency by currency basis and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of the bond attributable to changes in interest rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges as they hedge the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bonds attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
The cash flows are expected to occur in 2010 and 2015 when the respective bonds which they hedge mature.
The interest element of the cash flow hedges is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2010 and 2015.
At 31st March 2006, 49% of the groups net debt and 52% of the companys net debt was at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 5.43%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.0% impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
- Johnson Matthey 86 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 27 Financial risk management continued 27b Foreign currency risk 2006 The group operates globally with the majority of its profits earned outside the UK.
It has significant investments outside the UK with the largest single investment being in the USA.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA, Europe and Japan by borrowing US dollars, euros and yen respectively.
Although a large element of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, some is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
The group has designated the currency swaps and one loan as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries net assets against movements in exchange rates.
The main currencies of the net debt after taking into account the effect of the currency swaps at 31st March 2006 were: Group Parent company Borrowings Cash Borrowings Cash million million million million Sterling 118.4 105.5 117.2 84.2 US dollar 287.5 36.5 152.6 16.2 Euro 173.1 7.6 184.4 Japanese yen 24.8 4.3 24.8 Hong Kong dollar 17.4 Chinese renminbi 11.6 6.2 6.0 Malaysian ringgit 0.1 8.7 Brazilian real 7.8 Other currencies 4.1 13.6 2.2 0.8 619.6 207.6 487.2 101.2 The group and parent company use forward exchange contracts, and occasionally currency options, to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2007.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5 cent 2.8% movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling has a 0.8% impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5 cent 3.4% movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling has a 0.6% impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
27c Liquidity risk 2006 The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
The groups and parent companys borrowings generally do not exhibit large seasonal variations.
Within long term debt of 454.7 million at 31st March 2006, the group had borrowings under committed bank facilities of 191.0 million.
The parent companys long term debt at 31st March 2006 was 327.1 million including committed bank borrowings of 69.8 million.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.
Parent Group company million million Undrawn committed borrowing facilities Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 45.1 45.1 Expiring in more than two years 53.9 53.9 99.0 99.0 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 - 87 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 27 Financial risk management continued 27d Credit risk 2006 Within certain divisions, the group and parent company derive a significant proportion of their revenue from sales to major customers.
Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts significantly overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
As at 31st March 2006, no single outstanding balance exceeded 2% of the companys market capitalisation.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
As at 31st March 2006, the maximum exposure with a single bank for net deposits was 16.5 million for the group and 14.4 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 0.5 million for the group and parent company.
The group guarantees its share of the borrowings and precious metal leases of its associates and its exposure at 31st March 2006 was 1.5 million 2005 2.1 million.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2006 was 155.0 million 2005 142.1 million.

It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the unquoted available-for-sale investments.
The fair values of the bonds and interest rate swaps are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
The fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps is the market value of equivalent swaps which could be taken out at the balance sheet date with the same banks, the same maturity dates and identical terms.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency swaps represents the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts to year end forward exchange rates obtained from the banks the contracts are with.
The fair value of the embedded derivatives are calculated by using a suitable valuation technique.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their size, short term nature or the fact that they bear interest at floating rates.
- Johnson Matthey 88 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 27 Financial risk management continued 27f Financial instruments accounting policies 2005 Financial instruments were accounted for as follows in the year ended 31st March 2005: Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These forward contracts were revalued to the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and any aggregate unrealised gains and losses arising on revaluation were included in other receivables other payables.
At maturity, or when the contract ceases to be a hedge, gains and losses were taken to the income statement.
Currency options are occasionally used to hedge foreign exchange exposures, usually when the forecast receipt or payment amounts are uncertain.
Option premia were recognised at their historic cost in the group balance sheet as prepayments or accruals and released to the income statement, net of any realised gains, when the outcome became certain on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the option.
Interest rate swaps are occasionally used to hedge the groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps was accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps were not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Currency swaps are used to reduce costs and credit exposure where the group would otherwise have cash deposits and borrowings in different currencies.
The difference between spot and forward rate for these contracts was recognised as part of the net interest payable over the period of the contract.
These swaps were revalued to the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and any aggregate unrealised gains or losses arising on revaluation were included in other receivables other payables.
Realised gains and losses on these currency swaps were taken to reserves in the same way as for the foreign investments and borrowings to which the swaps related.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption available for short term receivables and payables.

This involves estimating the effect on profit before tax over various periods of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Most of the groups borrowings and deposits are at floating rates.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.1% impact on profit before tax and restructuring costs.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar since Johnson Mattheys largest single overseas investment is in the US.
A 5 cent 2.7% movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling has a 0.8% impact on total operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro.
A 5 cent 3.4% movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling has a 0.6% impact on operating profit.

27m Gains and losses on hedges 2005 Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These forward contracts are revalued to the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and any aggregate unrealised gains and losses arising on revaluation are included in other receivables other payables.
At maturity, or when the contract ceases to be a hedge, gains and losses are taken to the income statement.

b Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations amortisation of goodwill is no longer required but instead annual impairment reviews have to be performed.
Johnson Matthey has elected to take advantage of the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 not to recalculate goodwill for all business combinations.
Therefore the group and parent company have not adjusted their carrying amount of goodwill at 1st April 2004 the groups and parent companys date of transition from that previously disclosed under UK GAAP.
The main adjustment to goodwill on the balance sheet is to reverse all amortisation charged since 1st April 2004. c Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets the group and parent company have to capitalise all development expenditure which meets the recognition criteria laid down in the standard and then amortise the asset over its useful life once it is available for use.
Under UK GAAP Johnson Matthey did not capitalise any development expenditure.
Under IFRS, assets have been recognised in Catalysts Division for some development expenditure on heavy duty diesel catalysts and fuel cell components.
The group and parent company believe that all other development expenditure is for incremental improvements to existing processes or for projects in an early stage of development and so no assets have been recognised.
In addition, under IAS 38 any capitalised software that is not an integral part of the related hardware is reclassified from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
d Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the group and parent company have to recognise a charge to income in respect of the fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees and shares allocated under the long term incentive plan after 7th November 2002.
The fair value has been calculated using an adjusted Black-Scholes options valuation model and is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting.
- Johnson Matthey 102 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 44 Reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS continued Explanation of major differences between UK GAAP and IFRS group and parent company continued e As Johnson Matthey has already adopted FRS 17, the recent UK GAAP standard for post retirement benefits, the only adjustments needed in the group for post-employment benefits under IAS 19 Employee Benefits are to put the net return on retirement benefits assets and liabilities into operating profit, to change the market value of the pension schemes assets from mid-market value to bid value on the balance sheet and to move the deferred tax balances on the net post-employment assets obligations to deferred tax.
Under FRS 17 the parent company did not include the main UK defined benefit pension plan in its balance sheet and just accounted for contributions paid into the plan.
Under IAS 19 the main UK pension plan is included in the parent companys results and balance sheets as it is the sponsoring employer of the plan.
The other adjustments under IAS 19 are to accrue for paid annual leave and other short and long term employee benefits.
f Under IAS 28 Investments in Associates the groups share of the profit of its associates is shown on a post tax basis, unlike UK GAAP where the groups share of the operating profit of its associates is shown and the groups share of its associates interest and tax are shown in finance costs and income tax expense respectively.
g Under IAS 12 Income Taxes the group and parent company is providing for deferred tax on capital gains rolled over, capital gains on intra group loans and capital losses which it did not provide for under UK GAAP.
Other adjustments are to provide for deferred tax on the other IFRS accounting changes.
Also, IAS 12 does not allow the offset of tax assets and liabilities and so the group has grossed up its current tax assets and liabilities and its deferred tax assets and liabilities.
h Under IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability on the balance sheet and so the final dividend has not been provided for on the groups and parent companys balance sheets.
i Under IAS 17 Leases the groups and parent companys precious metal leases are categorised as operating leases and so they, and the related inventory, are removed from the balance sheet and are reported as a note on the accounts.
j There are a number of other reclassifications on the balance sheet mainly to separate out current and non-current assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
k As required under IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates exchange differences arising on translation of subsidiaries results and net assets are now shown as a separate component of equity.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption allowed in IFRS 1 to deem the cumulative translation difference for all overseas subsidiaries and associates to be zero at 1st April 2004. l As disclosed in the IFRS restatement notes last year, Johnson Matthey has changed its segments under IFRS from those shown under UK GAAP.
Colour Technologies, which formed part of Colours & Coatings Division, was transferred to Precious Metal Products Division.
Ceramics, which comprised the remaining part of Colours & Coatings Division, is shown as a separate segment.
Platinum Group Metal Refining, which was part of Catalysts Division, has been transferred to Precious Metal Products Division.
m Under IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements the cost of investments in subsidiaries is reduced by distributions from pre-acquisition profits.
