1 An Efficient Frontier is related to the Markowitz Model of constructing a diversified portfolio.
In a graph showing expected return and risk of different portfolios, the Efficient Frontier is the line along which the optimal portfolios lie.
That is those showing the best return for a given level of risk.
2 Value at risk VaR is a technique which uses the statistical analysis of market returns, correlations and volatilities to estimate the likelihood that a given portfolios losses will exceed a certain amount under usual circumstances.
The Amlin model uses market data from Watson Wyatt Investment Consulting.
The model calculates the VaR over a 12 month period at different confidence levels.
The confidence level is the degree of assurance that a specific loss is not exceeded.
A 99% confidence level VaR99 is used to set the strategic benchmarks, which means that the loss should only be exceeded once in a hundred years, in normal market conditions.
