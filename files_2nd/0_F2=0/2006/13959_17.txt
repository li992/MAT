Notes to the Company Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2006 1 Accounting policies The principal UK GAAP accounting policies applied in preparing the companys Accounts are set out below.
Basis of accounting The Accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of derivative financial instruments, in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board and comply with the Companies Act 1985.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the balance sheet at cost, or nominal value of shares issued as consideration where applicable, less provision for any impairment in value.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the company is UK sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any gain or loss arising on the restatement of such balances is taken to the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement and related party disclosures The company is included in the group Accounts of Scottish Power plc, which are publicly available.
Consequently the company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements Revised 1996.
The company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the group.
Share-based payments The company fully recharges its operating subsidiaries for the cost of share-based payments made by the company.
For grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002, this cost is measured based on the fair value at the date of grant.
For prior awards, the cost is measured based on the intrinsic value at the date of grant.
The cost of sharebased payments increases investments in subsidiaries with a corresponding credit to reserves.
As the amounts are fully recharged to subsidiaries on inter-company account, there is a corresponding credit to investments in subsidiaries resulting in no net impact on the amount of investments in subsidiaries.
Own shares held under trust In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, own shares held under trust for the Scottish Power plc groups employee share schemes are deducted in arriving at shareholders equity.
Purchases and sales of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
Events after the balance sheet date The company has applied FRS 21 Events After the Balance Sheet Date for the first time in the companys own Accounts and, as a result, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not accrued as was the previous practice.
Other creditors have decreased and the profit and loss account reserves have increased at 31 March 2005 by 139.4 million as a result of excluding the proposed final dividend for 2004 05.
Taxation In accordance with FRS 19 Deferred tax, full provision is made for deferred tax on a non-discounted basis.
Loans and other borrowings All borrowings are stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
The issue costs and interest payable on bonds are charged to the profit and loss account at a constant rate over the life of the bond.
Premiums or discounts arising on the early repayment of borrowings are recognised in the profit and loss account as incurred or received.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Scottish Power Finance Jersey Limited issued $700 million bonds which are convertible into preference shares in Scottish Power Finance Jersey Limited which are subsequently convertible into shares in Scottish Power plc and are guaranteed by Scottish Power plc.
With effect from 1 April 2005, the delivery of a fixed number of own equity shares in exchange for a fixed amount of foreign currency represents a financial liability in Scottish Power plc.
As a derivative financial liability, the company has, on implementation of FRS 26 with effect from 1 April 2005, measured the call options within this debt structure at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded through the profit and loss account.
The opening adjustment at 1 April 2005 on implementation of FRS 26 was 34.8 million net of tax of 14.9 million.
Prior to 1 April 2005, the call option was not recognised within the Accounts in accordance with UK GAAP for financial instruments prior to the introduction of FRS 26.
The written call option is an American option with a fair value that incorporates the value of equity shares delivered compared to preference shares received.
2 Employees The company has no employees and it is not the sponsoring company of any of the groups retirement benefit schemes.
Directors are remunerated by other group companies.
Full details of directors remuneration is provided in the Remuneration Report of the Directors in Tables 33 to 36 on pages 63 to 68.

On 15 May 2006, one in every three of the companys existing ordinary shares were reclassified into B shares.
