As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account is not presented.
Foreign currencies All exchange differences arising on foreign currencies are taken to the profit and loss account.
Interest Interest on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings held at amortised cost is recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest method.
Interest includes exchange differences arising on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Interest includes all fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, and corresponding adjustments to hedged items under designated fair value hedging relationships, where they relate to financing activities and are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Interest includes dividends paid on convertible preference shares.
Retirement benets The pension rights of Rexam PLC employees are dealt with through a self administered scheme, the assets of which are held independently of the Groups finances.
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme that is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from Rexam PLC and its subsidiaries at rates advised by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
In accordance with FRS17, Rexam PLC accounts for its contributions as though it were a defined contribution scheme.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cover Rexam PLC and a number of its subsidiaries and it cannot be split between each subsidiary on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Full details of the scheme and its deficit can be found in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
Share based payment Rexam PLC operates various share settled share option schemes.
The services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds.
Share settled share options granted directly to subsidiary company employees are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary.
The capital contribution is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options and recognised as an increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds.
The recognition of the fair value is based on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
FRS20 has been applied to share settled share options granted after 7 November 2002.
The Rexam Employee Share Trust holds shares in Rexam PLC which are presented as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Tangible xed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of tangible fixed assets over their expected lives by equal annual instalments.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets.
Assumed lives vary according to the class of asset as follows: Computer hardware and software 2 to 7 years Fixtures and fittings 4 to 10 years Investment in joint venture The investment in the joint venture is stated at cost less provisions for impairment where appropriate.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for impairment where appropriate.
Dividends Under FRS21, final ordinary dividends payable to the shareholders of Rexam PLC are recognised in the period that they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim ordinary dividends payable are recognised in the period that they are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
118 Notes to the company financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Company include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward aluminium commodity contracts.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Companys risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: i Fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
ii Cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the profit and loss account.
For cash flow hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in reserves, with any ineffective portion recognised in the profit and loss account.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in reserves are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in reserves are transferred to the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the profit and loss account.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings excluding convertible preference shares are measured at amortised cost except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which case the carrying value is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risk.
On 16 October 2006 the convertible preference shares were redeemed as described in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Prior to redemption, they were split into a liability component and an equity component.
On issue, the fair value of the liability component was determined using a market rate for an equivalent non convertible bond and recognised in borrowings on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
The remainder of the proceeds of the issue was allocated to the conversion option that was recognised in preference share capital.
The change in value of the conversion option, other than on conversion or redemption, in subsequent accounting periods was not recognised in the financial statements.
Dividends on convertible preference shares were charged as interest in the profit and loss account.
Debtors are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Debtors are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Disclosures have been made on financial instruments as required by the Companies Act 1985.
Rexam PLC is exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS25.

Other reserves reflect unrealised gains related to the transfer of investments between subsidiaries.
The profit and loss reserve of 153m 2005: 207m arose partly as a result of a provision of 214m against certain investments in subsidiaries in 2001 of which 156m was reversed in 2005.
The directors consider the value of the remaining investments in subsidiaries are considerably more than their book value and, accordingly, the remaining provision of 58m does not impact the distributable reserves of Rexam PLC which were 207m at 31 December 2006 2005: 265m.

The net effect of currency movements US$bn reduced underlying operating profit by 3m primarily due Source: Company annual accounts and Rexam estimates.
The gures are proforma, to the weakening of the US dollar against sterling.
which for Rexam includes its 2006 acquisitions.
We acted swiftly to mitigate these effects with price increases in some of our businesses, reduction of our cost base and product mix improvements.
Continued focus on operational excellence, a key area for Rexam, resulted in 32m of cost efficiencies.
However, despite all these actions, we were unable to fully offset the effects of the increase in input costs.
Underlying profit before tax was 303m but, with the benefit of a lower tax charge, underlying earnings per share were 40.6p, a rise of 3%.
Free cash flow generation was good at 173m, even allowing for higher interest costs and an increase in capital expenditure to fund the large number of growth projects.
Net borrowings were 1.17bn with interest cover robust at 4.8 times, higher than our target of being above 4.0 times.
On a statutory basis, including the effect of acquisitions, disposed businesses and currency, sales were 3,738m, up 15%.
On this basis, profit before tax including exceptional items was down 7% at 307m.
The principal exceptional gain arose from a change in US retirement benefits offset by disposals and restructuring costs within Plastic Packaging.
The resulting basic earnings per share were 39.7p compared with 40.4p for the equivalent period last year.

The 330ml Rexam AluSleek, as it is known, uses the same end as the standard can, but is taller and more slender, giving a completely new look to the product.
The shape is modern and fresh which makes it ideal for packaging mineral water and health drinks, as well as iced coffee, fruit juices, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages.
The AluSleek can has opened up exciting new opportunities for brands to use beverage cans in Europe, and is just one of many innovations to drive profitable growth in Rexam.

This innovative business, based on patented technologies and know how, expanded our global dispensing systems offering and made us the world leader in the high growth segment of foam pumps, with over 80% market share.
The dispensing systems are inherently environmentally friendly as they do not use gas propellants.

Consumers appreciate the fact that cans are lightweight, easy to chill and that they keep the contents carbonated.
Beverage producers favour them because they are quick and efficient to fill, are easy to transport and maintain product integrity.
They also provide optimum exposure for the brand and are effective in moving volume especially in multi pack formats.
For retailers, cans are easy to handle and make effective use of space on supermarket shelves.
Added to all this, aluminium cans are fully recyclable: in fact, they are the most recycled type of beverage packaging.

We are not only building new plants in Brazil, Russia and Austria to meet the expected growth in demand, we are converting lines to extend our capacity for special size beverage cans such as the 16oz, 24oz and the Rexam TM SLEEK can.
The conversions not only ensure that we keep our 12oz capacity in balance but also that we meet growing demand for these innovative sizes.
In 2006, we gained a foothold in the emerging Indian market forming a joint venture with Hindustan Tin Works to build the first beverage can making plant in India.

indd 29 26 3 07 09:20:25 Business Review The Community Rexam plants are usually important constituents in their local communities.
They are not only substantial employers, but they also contribute in many other ways: through charitable donations: staff volunteering: product donations and any other way in which they can usefully contribute to the strength and well being of their local communities.
As a UK company, we made donations to two main UK charities in 2006: The Princes Trust and the British Occupational Health Research Foundation.
We supported the making of a film for the Eco 4 The World Foundation, a United Nations sponsored educational foundation.
We also allocated funds to other charities where we matched employees fundraising efforts.
However, the majority of our community work is undertaken Rexam is developing new product lines to support customers commitment to sustainability.
The products above use biodegradable and recyclable on a local level.
corn based and wood based resin.
The cost is similar to that of traditionally made products.
In South America, for example, Rexam employees regularly organise activities to raise awareness about the importance of sustainable development in the community.
In 2006, they produced leaflets to encourage recycling efforts, set up fun environmental workshops for children and at local schools, planted seeds in order to make a contribution to the natural resources in the local communities in which we operate.
At our Swedish glassworks in the rural community of Limmared, there is a good deal of commercial traffic to and from the plant.
It includes trucks supplying raw materials, delivering finished products to our customers or unloading the recycled materials we use in our processes.
To promote road safety, Rexam provides high visibility vests to all the children in the area.
This not only makes them more visible to drivers but also serves as a reminder to the children to be aware of traffic and potential road dangers.
More examples of the work our employees have done, and continue to do, to help the people and communities and environment surrounding their sites can be found in the CR Where we manufacture packaging in emerging economies such as Brazil, section of our website.
