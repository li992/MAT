| | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT 2006 61 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 18 Borrowings continued Financial instruments and risk management The primary financial risk faced by the Group is exchange rate risk.
The board has reviewed and agreed policies for management of this risk, as summarised below.
The board has also approved all of the classes of financial instruments that may be used by the Group.
The Groups treasury function, which is authorised to conduct the day-to-day treasury activities of the Group, reports at least annually to the board.
The occasional use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the board, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
All of the Groups activities involve analysis, acceptance and management of some degree of risk or combination of risks.
The most important types of financial risk are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Market risks include foreign exchange, interest rate and equity price risks.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and limits continually by means of reliable and up-to-date systems.
The Group modies and enhances its risk management policies and systems to reect changes in markets and products.
The Audit Committee, under authority delegated by the board, formulates high level Group risk management policy, monitors risk and receives reports that allow it to review the effectiveness of the Groups risk management policies.
Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
It arises principally from lending, trade finance, treasury and leasing activities.
The Group has dedicated standards, policies and procedures to control and monitor all such risks.
Although the Group is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties, such credit risk is controlled through credit rating reviews of the counterparties and by limiting the total amount of exposure to any one party.
The Group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations of credit risk.
Liquidity management The Group maintains a strong liquidity position and manages the liquidity prole of its assets, liabilities and commitments so that cashows are appropriately balanced and all funding obligations are met when due.
Market risk management Market risk is the risk that movements in market rates, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity and commodity prices will reduce the Groups income or the value of its portfolios.
The management of market risk is undertaken using risk limits approved by the finance directors under delegated authority.
The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
However, subsidiary undertakings only occasionally make significant sales or purchases in currencies other than their functional currencies and hence on rare occasions the Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage these exposures.
The Group did not enter into any material derivative instruments during the year or the prior year and there were no open derivative instruments at 31st May 2006 or 31st May 2005.
Financial instruments utilised by the Group during the years ended 31st May 2006 and 31st May 2005, together with information regarding the methods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised as follows: Current and non-current investments In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, unlisted investments are held in the Groups balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
The carrying value of the Groups listed investments, which are classied as held-for-trading, is nil 2005: 14.0 million.
At 31st May 2005 investments were measured at cost less amounts written off in accordance with UK GAAP.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings and cash The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of long-term borrowings at 31st May 2006 is estimated to not be materially different to its carrying value.
The financial instruments held by the Group do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash ow interest rate risk.
