Share-based payment continued The fair value of ESOS, LTIP and Unilog Management Incentive scheme options was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of Sharesave scheme options was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value of share awards under the Equity Participation Partnership Plans was measured at the market share price at the date of grant reduced for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period, for which award holders have no entitlement.
Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the share option.
The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
Share awards under the Equity Participation Partnership Plans are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date.
Sharesave options are assumed to be exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full.
Adjustments are made subsequently, where necessary, to re ect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the final determination on the vesting date.
The share-based payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the balance sheet date to the end of the vesting period following cessation of employment.
A weighted average forfeiture rate of 7% per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year ended 31 December 2006 2005: 10%.
For exercises prior to the vesting date, the additional expense between the calculation date and the vesting date is immediately charged to the income statement.
The group recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of 9.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2006 2005: 5.9 million.
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements The group does not operate separate cash-settled share-based payments arrangements: however, social security obligations arising on share option and share award schemes are treated as such an arrangement for accounting purposes.
The liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments at 31 December 2006 was 1.8 million 2005: 1.2 million.
The movement in the liability resulted in an expense for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 0.6 million 2005: gain of 0.4 million.
Retirement bene t schemes fide ned contribution schemes The group operates a number of voluntary pension schemes of the fide ned contribution type in the UK and overseas, under which contributions are paid by group undertakings.
In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge for fide ned contribution schemes amounted to 64.0 million 2005: 35.3 million.
fide ned bene t schemes In addition, the group operates fide ned bene t pension schemes primarily for the bene t of employees in the UK and the Netherlands, with smaller schemes in other European countries and the US.
fide ned bene t schemes are usually funded by contributions from the employing companies, and in some cases also employees, to the meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews.
The schemes assets are held in funds separate from those of the group.
Scheme bene ts typically provide for a pension in retirement based on years of qualifying service and final pensionable salary.
The most recent valuations of plan assets, reimbursement rights and fide ned bene t obligations were carried out at 31 December 2006 by quali ed actuaries.
The present value of the fide ned bene t obligation, and the related current and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The weighted average principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: UK schemes Overseas schemes 2006 2005 2006 2005 Discount rate % 5.15 4.75 4.74 4.24 Average life expectancy for 65-year-old male years 20 20 17 17 Expected return on plan assets % 6.94 6.85 4.02 3.67 Expected return on reimbursement rights % 4.50 4.82 General salary increases % 3.10 2.85 1.98 1.96 Rate of increase of pensions in payment % 3.10 2.80 0.56 0.47 In ation % 3.10 2.80 2.06 2.15 103 Financial statements Consolidated financial statements LogicaCMG Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38.
Retirement bene t schemes continued The amounts recognised in the income statement as employee bene t expense for fide ned bene t schemes were as follows: 2006 UK Overseas All schemes schemes schemes m m m Current service cost 6.0 6.0 12.0 Past service cost 11.6 11.6 Interest cost 9.9 7.1 17.0 Expected return on plan assets 10.5 5.6 16.1 Expected return on reimbursement rights 0.4 0.4 6.2 7.1 0.9 Past service costs included a 9.0 million gain which is presented as an exceptional item, further details of which are provided in note 8.
The remaining 2.6 million gain represented the effect of changes in UK pension legislation introduced on 6 April 2006 A-day.
A-day allowed members of the UK fide ned bene t pension schemes to take up to 25% of their pension as a tax-free cash sum at retirement.
The group changed the assumptions relating to the cash sum taken by scheme members at retirement and this resulted in a 2.6 million gain, which has been recognised in full within operating pro t. 2005 UK Overseas All schemes schemes schemes m m m Current service cost 6.1 5.6 11.7 Curtailment gain 0.4 0.4 Interest cost 9.7 6.7 16.4 Expected return on plan assets 8.4 6.6 15.0 Expected return on reimbursement rights 0.4 0.4 7.4 4.9 12.3 The actual return on plan assets for UK schemes was a 15.0 million gain 2005: 25.9 million gain and for overseas schemes was a 9.7 million loss 2005: 18.9 million gain.
The actual return on reimbursement rights for overseas schemes was a 0.5 million loss 2005: 0.7 million gain.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense at 31 December 2006 was 11.2 million 2005: loss of 6.3 million.
