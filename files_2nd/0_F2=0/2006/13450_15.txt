RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 General information Rightmove plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and equity account the Groups interest in its associate.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
The 2005 income statement has been restated to present comparatives for the discontinued operations.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Company engaged in providing products and services that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Companys primary format for segmental reporting is by business segment.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
The classication and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Companys opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 January 2004.
IFRS 1 permits goodwill on acquisitions made before this date to be brought on to the balance sheet at 1 January 2004 at its carrying value under UK GAAP.
44 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Basis of consolidation Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant inuence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant inuence commences until the date that significant inuence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
Investments Investments in associates are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Ofce equipment, xtures & ttings 20% per annum Computer equipment 20% per annum Intangible assets The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property website.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement when incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and the Company has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes cost of materials, subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic benets embodied in the specic asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
Computer software is capitalised and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 20% 33.3% per annum Impairment The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at the transition date: no impairment was deemed necessary.
An impairment test is performed annually on goodwill regardless of the existence of impairment indicators.
45 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 NOTES CONTINUED 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Where cash is received in exchange for entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pensions The Company provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme dened contribution plan into which employees may elect to contribute via salary deduction.
Employee share schemes The share option programme allows certain senior management employees to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in the income statement over the period to which the employees become unconditionally entitled, on all share-based payment schemes granted after 7 November 2002 and which have not vested by 1 January 2005, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Awards made before this date are not accounted for under IFRS 2, as permitted under the transitional rules of IFRS 1.
For awards made after 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January 2005, the charge is based on the fair value of the option granted, calculated using an option pricing model.
Own shares held by Employee benefit Trust EBT Transactions of the Company-sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reected in the Parent Company and Group financial statements.
In particular, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risk specic to the liability.
Vacant leasehold properties a provision is maintained in respect of vacant leasehold properties to take account of the net present value of residual lease commitments over the remaining term of the lease.
Financial instruments Treasury policies and management The Groups treasury policies are designed to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Groups businesses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Trade payables are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Net financial income Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances and deposits.
Financing costs comprise interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts and other bank charges.
Net financial income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Income tax Income tax on the results for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
46 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business that has been disposed of or has been abandoned.
Discontinued operations are presented on the income statement including the comparative period as a column analysing the post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation.
Comparative information has been restated to include the results of discontinued operations for the prior year.
Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following Adopted IFRSs were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosure applicable for years commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The application of IFRS 7 in 2006 would not have affected the balance sheets or income statement as the standard is concerned only with disclosure.
The Group plans to adopt it in 2007.
There are no other Adopted IFRSs available for early application which affect the balance sheet or income statement of the Group or Company.
Revenue Revenue represents the amounts excluding value added tax receivable from customers in respect of properties advertised on the website.
Revenue relating to properties advertised on the website is recognised in the month to which it relates.
Resale properties are billed one month in advance and new home developments are typically billed monthly in arrears.
Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised as deferred revenue and released to the income statement on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services.
Dividends Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability and deduction to equity at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
3 Discontinued operations On 18 July 2006, the Government announced fundamental changes to the contents of HIP, specically that the Home Condition Report within the HIP would be voluntary for the foreseeable future.
As a consequence, the Board decided to discontinue the HIP business.
The total spend during the year was 6,668,000 including exit costs of 1,900,000 and research costs of 2,060,000.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, the HIP division had cash outows from operating activities of 5,226,000 2005: 1,540,000.
The net book value of computer and ofce equipment 315,000 and the net book value of computer software relating to HIP 696,000 have been written off.

The differences are explained below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 2006 31 December 2005 000 000 Current tax reconciliation profit before tax 7,268 5,536 Current tax at 30% 2005: 30% 2,180 1,661 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 744 499 Adjustment in respect of prior years 2 Total tax charge see above 2,924 2,158 A notional tax charge of 3,544,000 was applied for the year ended 31 December 2006 and recognised directly in equity in line with the requirements of IFRS 2.
No corporation tax liability is due at 31 December 2006.
The effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2006 is 40% 2005: 39%.
The difference between this and the corporation tax of 30% is mainly due to the high level of expenditure on which no tax deduction is available, notably otation costs and the share option charge.
During the year a significant tax deduction of 21,101,000 arose on share options exercised on otation.
An element of this tax deduction was carried back to eliminate the corporation tax charge of 2,114,000 in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005.
The tax credit was recognised directly in reserves as it arose on share options exercised for which the related IFRS 2 charge was nil.

The recoverable amount of the assets in the unit was estimated to be nil and therefore the assets were fully impaired.
This did not result in any impairment being identied other than on assets associated with the HIP business.

The deferred tax asset related to the tax losses arising on share options exercised during the year for which no related equity settled share options charge was recognised, is reected in retained earnings.
During the year a significant tax deduction of 21,101,000 arose on share options exercised.
The tax credit was recognised directly in retained earnings as it arose on share options exercised for which the related IFRS 2 charge was nil.
The remaining tax deduction was set against the taxable profits arising during the year ended 31 December 2006 resulting in an overall tax loss for the year.
A deferred tax asset of 689,000 was created for the tax loss carried forward of 2,297,000 which the directors believe will crystallise in the short term.
