Operating losses of 460m 2005 351m are carried forward and available to reduce future taxable income in a number of jurisdictions: these losses have given rise to deferred tax assets of 145m 2005 111m against which are set valuation adjustments of 76m 2005 85m.
In a number of jurisdictions UK, Netherlands and the USA there are insufficient taxable temporary timing differences to allow recognition of these assets and either forecasts in these jurisdictions show recurring taxable losses or the forecasts do not indicate that it will be more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits to support recognition.
13m 2005 3m of these losses, net of valuation allowances, have expiry dates through to 2015 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.
In addition, there are deductible temporary differences of 749m 2005 888m against which are set valuation allowances of 410m 2005 407m.
There are also contingent deferred tax assets related to certain potential capital loss carry forwards that are under discussion with the relevant taxing authorities.
As the extent of those losses is uncertain, management has not quantified them or any related deferred tax asset.
