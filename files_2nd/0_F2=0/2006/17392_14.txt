Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting WS Atkins plc is a public limited company registered in the UK.
Its registered ofce is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 5BW, England.
The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS, and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
A summary of the more important accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements is given below.
These financial statements are covered by IFRS 1, First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, as they are the Groups first IFRS financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Material estimates applied across the Groups businesses and Joint Ventures are reviewed to a common standard and adjusted where appropriate to ensure that consistent treatment of similar and related issues that require judgement is achieved upon consolidation.
Any revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Except where noted below, the Group has applied historical cost accounting.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, except in relation to IAS 32, Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation, and IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, and the IFRIC draft interpretations in respect of PPP PFI concessions, as permitted by IFRS 1.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRIC D12 to D14 for the comparative period has been included in note 41.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated income statement and balance sheet include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of Joint Ventures.
The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year are included in the income statement up to the date of disposal.
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Where subsidiaries do not adopt accounting periods that are co-terminous with the Groups, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date.
The accounts of the Employee benefit Trusts EBTs are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by independent Trustees and their assets are held separately from those of the Group, in practice the Groups advice on how the assets are used for the benefit of employees is normally accepted.
The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the EBTs until the shares vest unconditionally in the employees.
Shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in retained loss earnings.
Other assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Revenue Revenue from long term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the period calculated in accordance with the Groups policy for contract accounting set out below.
Revenue from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services provided during the period.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from third party contractors and recharge them on to the customer at cost.
The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.
Receivables, creditors and cash relating to these transactions are included in the Group balance sheet.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and attributable profit.
Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed in trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any contract, when the excess is separately disclosed in trade and other payables as fees invoiced in advance.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2006 65 Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued profit is recognised on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project can be reasonably foreseen.
Provision is made in full for estimated losses.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on completion.
Where contracts span two or more accounting periods profit is not generally recognised until the contract is 50% complete.
Revenue recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined by reference to the proportion of the annual service delivered to date.
Where the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal or termination of a contract are higher in the final period of the contract a proportion of revenue is deferred each period to meet these anticipated costs.
Full provision is made for losses on outsourcing contracts if the forecast costs of fullling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
In assessing the amount of the loss to provide on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Groups share of the forecast results from any Joint Ventures which the contract is servicing.
Pre-contract costs The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with IAS 11, Construction contracts.
Costs incurred before it becomes probable that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses.
Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the balance sheet and charged to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP PFI concessions, over the same period as the Groups interest in any Special Purpose Company SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP PFI concessions, over the same period as the Groups interest in any SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement.
Where the Groups interest in any SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the income statement in proportion to the reduction of the Groups interest.
Joint Ventures In accordance with IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, the Group accounts for Joint Ventures under the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of a Joint Ventures profit after tax is included from the date on which the Group acquires joint control.
Within the consolidated balance sheet the investment is recorded at cost classied as a non-current asset and subsequently adjusted to reect the Groups share of the movements in the Joint Ventures net assets post-acquisition.
The results, assets and liabilities of Joint Ventures are stated in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with the Groups accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are co-terminous with the Groups, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date.
PPP PFI concessions Assets constructed by PPP PFI concession companies are classied in the accounts of the Joint Ventures as financial assets or intangible assets, depending on whether the grantor or user has the primary responsibility to pay the operator for the concession services.
To date all of the Groups PPP PFI concession assets have been classed as financial assets.
The financial asset represents an interest-bearing, long term receivable.
The cost of the financial asset at any one time is equal to the accumulated value of service delivery plus accumulated interest charged to the financial asset less amounts received to date.
The financial asset is measured at fair value.
Where it is classed as a loan receivable any movement in fair value is taken to the income statement.
Where it is classed as available for sale any movement in fair value is taken to reserves.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of value added tax rebates and discounts.
Revenue from contracting activities represents the value of work carried out during the year including amounts not invoiced.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying value amount.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date as measured by the contract costs incurred.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract costs incurred will be recovered.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected resultant loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2006 66 1.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at cost less impairment.
Cost is calculated on a first-in, first-out basis.
Taxation Current and deferred taxation are recognised in the income statement for the period except where the taxation arises as a result of a transaction or event that is recognised directly in equity.
Taxation arising on transactions or events recognised directly in equity is charged or credited directly to equity.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all taxable temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is regarded as more likely than not that it will be recovered.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and Joint Ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no UK corporation tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Other intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment.
Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Amortisation ceased on 1 April 2004 and the carrying value of existing goodwill was frozen at that date and subject to annual impairment review.
On acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of the net assets.
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment review both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 was written off to retained earnings loss.
profit or loss on disposal of the underlying businesses to which this goodwill related will not include goodwill previously recorded as a deduction from equity.
Acquired intangibles The Group accounts for acquired intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets.
Intangible assets are stated at cost less impairment.
Such intangible assets are recognised separately if they meet the criteria for recognition, and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives unless these are indefinite in which case they are reviewed regularly for impairment.
The Groups acquired intangible assets primarily relate to software licences which are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the licence.
Corporate information systems In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets, the Groups corporate information systems are treated as an intangible asset.
Costs included are those directly attributable to the design, construction and testing of new systems including major enhancements and internally generated costs from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion where the probable future economic benets arising from the investment could be assessed with reasonable certainty at the time the costs are incurred.
Maintenance and minor modications are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
The corporate information systems are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life of six years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Cost comprises purchase price after discounts and rebates plus all directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2006 67 Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis calculated at annual rates to write off the cost less residual value of each asset over the term of its estimated useful economic life as follows: Freehold buildings 10 to 50 years Short leasehold over the life of the lease Plant and machinery 3 to 10 years Special purpose industrial motor vehicles 3 to 12 years Other motor vehicles 3 to 4 years Information technology 2.5 to 5 years No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land.
The directors annually review the estimated useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairments.
Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Financial assets Financial assets include UK government securities and restricted cash deposits, which are shown at market value.
Restricted cash deposits relate to accounts where withdrawals are restricted under contractual agreements.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Lease obligations Finance leases Lease arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are treated as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised within tangible xed assets and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the asset.
A liability is recognised for the present value of the minimum lease payments within current and or non-current liabilities as appropriate.
Rental payments are apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a constant rate of interest charge on the outstanding obligation.
Where the Group acts as a lessor in a finance lease, receivables under finance leases represent outstanding amounts due under these agreements less finance charges allocated to future periods.
Finance lease interest is recognised over the primary period of the lease so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash investment.
Operating leases Where the Group acts as lessee in an operating lease arrangement, the costs of operating leases are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Lease incentives received are recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Where the Group acts as lessor in an operating lease arrangement, rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives provided are recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2006 68 1.
Accounting policies continued Provisions Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fullling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
In assessing the amount of the loss to provide on any contract, account is taken of the Groups share of the forecast results from any Joint Ventures which the contract is servicing.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash ows to the end of the contract.
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming vacant.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash ows to the end of the lease.
Pension schemes The Group operates dened contribution and dened benefit pension schemes which require payments to be made into separately administered funds.
For dened benefit schemes, regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally qualied actuaries to determine the level of contributions required to fund the benets set out in the scheme rules.
The Group accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benets.
The cost of the dened contribution schemes is charged to operating profit as incurred.
The cost of the dened benefit schemes is charged as follows: The current service cost incurred during the period to provide retirement benets to employees is charged to operating profit.
Gains or losses arising from settlements or curtailments not covered by actuarial assumptions are included in operating profit.
A charge representing the expected increase in scheme liabilities is included in net finance costs.
This is based on the present value of scheme liabilities at the beginning of the period.
A credit representing the expected return on scheme assets is included within net finance costs.
This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the period allowing for expected cash ows during the period.
For dened benefit schemes, differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the period are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, together with differences arising from changes in assumptions.
The difference between the market value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities is recognised as a retirement benefit asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
To the extent that it is recoverable, any related deferred tax asset or liability is included in the relevant category of receivable payable.
The Group has adopted early the Amendment to IAS 19: Employee benets actuarial gains and losses, in all periods presented.
The Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full as they arise through retained loss earnings.
Foreign currency transactions and translation Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Trading results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at average rates of exchange.
Differences resulting from the retranslation of opening net assets and results for the period at closing rates are taken to the statement of recognised income and expense.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The fair value of financial assets is measured at each balance sheet date by computing the discounted future value of the cash ow allocated to the financial asset.
The movement in the fair value of available for sale financial assets since the previous balance sheet date is taken to equity.
With effect from 1 April 2005 financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
Where a derivative is a designated hedging instrument and is assessed as being effective in accordance with IAS 39, the gain or loss on re-measurement is recognised in equity.
In all other cases the gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2006 69 Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the cost of share-based payments awarded after 7 November 2002 is charged to the income statement over the performance and vesting periods of the instruments.
The cost is based on the fair value of the awards made at the date of grant adjusted for the number of awards expected to vest.
In accordance with the transitional provisions within IFRS 2, no charge is made in respect of instruments awarded before 7 November 2002.
The credits associated with the amounts charged to the income statement are included in retained earnings loss until the awards are exercised.
Where awards are settled by new issue shares any proceeds received in respect of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Where awards are settled in shares held by the EBTs any proceeds are credited to retained earnings loss.
Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group is organised into seven operating segments for management purposes, reecting its key markets and service offerings.
The segments are Design and Engineering Solutions, Highways and Transportation, Rail, Middle East and China, Management and Project Services, Asset Management and Equity Investments.
These segments form the basis for reporting the Groups primary segment information as it is the main determinant of the Groups risks and returns.
The basis for reporting the secondary segment information is the geographical sectors of the United Kingdom, other European countries, Middle East, North America and Asia Pacic.
These represent the Groups most significant geographical sectors.
The majority of central costs are allocated to segments based on revenue or utilisation of resource.
All revenue relates to revenue from services.

Atkins is required to invest 70m in Metronet by way of equity and shareholder subordinated debt over the first six years of the concession.
During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group invested 11.2m 2005: 11.1m.
The outstanding investment required is 37.3m 2005: 48.5m.
The contract Metronet has two separate 30-year performance-based contracts which together cover over two thirds of the London Underground network.
The contracts, which are split into four 7.5-year periods, cover inter alia the repair, refurbishment and modernisation of the infrastructure.
The contracts are subject to periodic review at the end of each 7.5-year period.
The periodic reviews allow for restating the scope of the work, the level of payment, the contractual terms and the performance requirements.
Metronet has contracted with Trans4m Ltd, a Joint Venture company in which Atkins has a 25% shareholding, to undertake the civil engineering work and the refurbishment programme.
Trans4m Ltd has signed a 7.5-year contract with Atkins for premises and civil design, inspection and assessment work and the design and build of new communication systems.
Metronets revenue consists of a xed element Underlying Infrastructure Service Charge which is adjusted for performance.
Performance is measured under three categories: capability, availability and ambience.
Shareholder returns are sensitive to these performance-based measures.
Consolidation of Metronets results In line with the Groups accounting policies on Joint Ventures, the results of Metronet have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
As part of its consolidation of Metronets balance sheet, Atkins initially recognised 8.7m of goodwill associated with liabilities inherited when the PPP companies were acquired from London Underground Limited.
Under the transition rules for the implementation of IFRS this balance was frozen at the carrying amount on 1 April 2004 of 7.8m and will be subject to an annual impairment review.

No account has been taken of the potential recovery through either extension of time or negotiated claims unless Metronet is virtually certain that such mitigations will be delivered.

Share based payments Long Term Incentive Plans WS Atkins 2003 Senior Executive and Key Employee Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2003 onwards A share plan for senior executives and key employees to make awards to employees which are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
The performance condition is total shareholder return TSR with an earnings per share EPS growth underpin measured over three financial years starting with the financial year beginning immediately after the award is granted.
Full vesting of any award will take place for a top 20% ranking against a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for a median ranking and no award if TSR falls below the median.
The EPS growth underpin is the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum.
As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will lapse.
In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
WS Atkins 2003 Senior Executive and Key Employee Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP pre-September 2003 A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees which are settled in equity.
Awards have an EPS performance condition.
EPS growth is required to be more than 12% per annum above the UK RPI in the relevant three-year performance period to enable all of the ordinary shares to be acquired, but if the EPS growth is less than 5% per annum above the UK RPI then none of the ordinary shares can be acquired.
A sliding scale in relation to the number of ordinary shares that can be acquired operates for growth in EPS between 5% and 12% above the UK RPI.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the award between vesting and exercise.
WS Atkins Pre-Tax Equity Participation Plan Pre-Tax EPP A share plan for senior executives and key employees which was designed to encourage investment in the Group by taking all or part of their bonus in the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares the Bonus Award which, if retained for a three-year period, gave them a right to obtain a matching number of ordinary shares the Matching Award.
The right to the matching ordinary shares is subject to a performance condition identical to those in the WS Atkins 2003 Senior Executive and Key Employee Long Term Incentive Plan prior to amendment on 16 September 2003.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest, on the shares subject to the Bonus Award after exercise and the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the Matching Award between vesting and exercise.
As a general rule Matching Awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will lapse.
WS Atkins Post-Tax Equity Participation Plan Post-Tax EPP A share plan for senior executives and key employees which was designed to encourage investment in the Group by taking all or part of their bonus in the form of ordinary shares the Deposited Shares which, if retained for a three-year period, gave them a right to obtain a matching number of ordinary shares the Matching Award.

On 1 December 2005 the Group issued awards over 34,014 shares to employees under the DBP and awards over 15,000 shares to employees under the WS Atkins Restricted Stock Unit Plan for Key Employees RSU.
For the purposes of arriving at the fair value of the awards a Monte Carlo option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: LTIP DBP RSU Risk-free interest rate 5% 5% 5% Dividend yield 2% 2% 2% Volatility 26% 26% 26% Share price at grant date 24 06 2005 670.0p 670.0p 670.0p 01 12 2005 742.5p 742.5p 742.5p Option life 3 to 10 years 10 years 3 years Expected exercise behaviour awards 70% year 4 70% year 4 70% year 4 15% year 5 15% year 5 15% year 5 10% year 6 10% year 6 10% year 6 5% years 7 to 10 5% years 7 to 10 5% years 7 to 10 allocations 100% year 4 100% year 4 100% year 4 Volatility for 2006 was determined based on a two-year share price history 2005: one-year in order to eliminate exceptional share price volatility.
The fair value of share plans involving performance conditions takes into account market information.
Expected lives of options have been determined based on historic exercise prices.
In accordance with the rules of the plan the Monte Carlo model simulates TSR for WS Atkins plc and the comparator group over the three-year performance period of the plan.
The model takes into account historic dividends and share price volatilities for WS Atkins plc and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 477.81 pence 2005: 394.98 pence.

Lease incentives Under UK GAAP, lease incentives were amortised over the period from inception of the lease until the first rent review.
Under IAS 17, Leases, lease incentives are amortised over the whole lease term.
As a result the Groups net assets as at 31 March 2005 decreased by 3.8m 1 April 2004: 2.9m and Group profit before tax decreased for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 1.3m.
Retirement benefit liabilities Under UK GAAP the Group accounted for retirement benefit liabilities under SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs.
The cost of providing dened benefit pensions was charged against operating profit.
Under IAS 19, Employee benets, the cost of providing pension benets and the retirement benefit obligation are determined annually by independent actuaries.
The interest arising on the projected obligations and the returns on the schemes assets is recognised in finance income cost.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
As a result, the Groups net assets decreased by 181.0m as at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004: 159.9m and Group profit before tax decreased by 7.4m for the year ended 31 March 2005. c. Intangible assets Under UK GAAP, the software for the Groups corporate information systems was treated as part of the associated hardware as a tangible xed asset.
Under IAS 38, Intangible assets, software is treated as an intangible asset unless it is an integral part of the related hardware.
Hence the remaining value of the Groups corporate information systems was re-classied as an intangible asset on transition to IFRS.
On transition, the Groups corporate information systems were written down by 8.9m, reducing the annual amortisation charge by 2.3m due to differing treatment of internally generated development costs under IFRS.
In addition, other software licences previously classied as prepayments within accounts receivable will now also be classied as intangible assets.
As a result the Group profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2005 increased by 2.3m and the Groups net assets decreased by 4.6m as at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004: 6.2m.
d. Share based payments Under UK GAAP, the cost recognised in respect of share options was based on the share price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.
The cost was spread over the vesting period for all schemes except the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP which was charged in full in the year the performance was measured.
Under IFRS 2, Share based payments, the cost, which is based on the fair value of the options, is spread over the vesting and performance period for all schemes granted after 7 November 2002.
As a result the Group profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2005 increased by 0.8m and the net assets increased by 5.7m 1 April 2004: 4.7m to reect the release of the accumulated accrual in respect of the DBP scheme.
e. Goodwill Under UK GAAP goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
Under IFRS 3, Business combinations, goodwill is no longer amortised but is carried at cost and subject to annual impairment review as at 31 March.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 April 2004.
The result of these changes is to increase Group profit before tax by 4.2m.
This represents the write back of the 5.9m of goodwill amortisation for the year ended 31 March 2005 of which 1.7m related to Hanscomb and 4.2m related to other acquisitions.
Under IFRS Hanscomb goodwill is written down by 7.2m to bring the carrying value at the end of the year into line with the UK GAAP carrying value at the end of the year.
Under UK GAAP, the charge consisted of 5.5m exceptional impairment charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 and 1.7m annual amortisation charge included in the 5.9m above.
The Groups net assets increased by 4.2m as at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004: nil.
f. Dividends Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends were accrued in the accounting period to which they related.
Under IAS 10, Events after the balance sheet date, dividends are recognised in the accounting period in which they are approved.
Under UK GAAP, a liability of 7.9m 1 April 2004: 6.8m was included in the results for the year ended 31 March 2005 in respect of the final dividend for the Group and the Company.
This dividend had not been declared by the shareholders at 31 March 2005 and as a result the liability has been reversed under IFRS.
g. IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRIC D12 to D14 Under UK GAAP, the Group treated PFI PPP assets as tangible xed assets.
Under IFRS and the draft interpretations issued by IFRIC, D12 to D14, on accounting for service concessions, the assets of the Groups PPP PFI concessions will be treated as financial assets from 1 April 2005.
Reconciliation of cash ows The restatement of the results to IFRS has no impact on the Groups cash generation.
The only significant impact of IFRS on the cash ow statement is the reclassication of movements in software licences from working capital movements to movements in other intangible assets.
Movements in software licences are split into amortisation, which is included in cash generated from operations, and purchases of other intangible assets, which is included within cash ows from investing activities.
