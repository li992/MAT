Called up share capital continued The Investec Limited shares were issued in South African Rands.
The amounts recorded above were calculated by reference to historic Pound Sterling Rand exchange rates.
The redeemable preference shares are all variable rate, cumulative and redeemable.
The terms of the various issues are as follows: Shares issued at a premium of R99 999.40 per share R175 million were redeemed on 29 November 2005.
Shares issued at a premium of R999 999.40 per share R600 million were redeemed on 22 March 2006.
Shares issued at a premium of R999 999.40 per share R633 million were redeemed on 31 March 2006.
Shares issued at a premium of R999 999.40 per share R575 million are redeemable on 31 March 2014.
Shares issued at a premium of R999 999.40 per share pay a dividend on 30 June, 30 September, 31 December and 31 March of 69.8% of South African prime of the subscription price R400 million and are redeemable on 12 May 2014.
The holder of 740 000 Investec Limited and 1 260 000 Investec plc shares has agreed to waive its right to dividends until 31 March 2008.
In terms of the Dual Listed Companies Structure, shareholders have common economic and voting rights as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.
These include equivalent dividends on a per share basis, joint electorate and class right voting, and equivalent position on the termination of either company.
The UK DAS shares, UK DAN share, SA DAS share, the SA DAN share and the special converting shares have been issued to achieve this.
The unissued shares are under the control of the directors until the next annual general meeting.
Staff Share Scheme The group operates a share option and a share purchase scheme for employees.
The number of ordinary shares conditionally allocated to employees are disclosed in the note 6.
"Movements in the number of share options issued for 1 share each, held by employees are as follows: At 31 March 2006 2005 Number Number Outstanding at beginning of year 14 364 580 16 177 140 Issued during the year 1 751 062 4 707 372 Exercised 3 018 521 1 695 218 Lapsed 695 805 4 824 714 Outstanding at end of year 12 401 316 14 364 580 The purpose of the staff share scheme is to promote an ""esprit fide corps"" within the organisation, create an awareness of Investec's performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group."
The group makes shares or debentures available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the group and stock market conditions.
In addition to the Staff Share Scheme, other incentive schemes are operated by the group.
Whilst the objectives of such schemes are identical to the Staff Share Scheme, membership of them is not extended to all staff members but to key members of the group whom executive management believe are in a position to add significant value to the group.
Whilst housed in different structures from the Staff Share Scheme the underlying assets in them are group instruments.
Any benefit derived by the members from such schemes is thus totally dependent on the performance of the group.
The extent of the director's interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on page 136 to 140.
