A summary of the Companys principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the period and the preceding period is set out below.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and company law.
Exemptions The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and not presented a profit and loss account for the Company alone.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash flow statements.
The cash flows of the Company are included in the William Hill PLC Group financial statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Parties from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the William Hill PLC Group.
Changes in accounting policy The Company has adopted the following standards in these financial statements: FRS 20 Share-based payment: FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date: FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation: and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
Details of the effect of the prior year adjustments are given in note 1.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any, for impairment.
Cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued for investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration that includes the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief.
Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

qxd 23 3 07 12:17 Page 87 Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at an average rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences arising are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of that debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is reduced by payments made in the period.
Accrued finance costs are included within accruals and deferred income.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps and collars.
The Company does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the William Hill PLC Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Termination payments made or received are spread over the life of the underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues to exist.
In other cases termination payments are taken to the profit and loss account.
Own shares held Own shares held in treasury and held in employment benefit trusts are included within reserves.
Share-based payments The Company has adopted the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment in these financial statements.
In accordance with the transition provisions included in FRS 20, its provisions have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees within the William Hill PLC Group and operates a number of Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option schemes open to all eligible employees within the William Hill PLC Group, which allow the purchase of shares at a discount.
The cost to the Group of both of these share-based payments is measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is borne by the employing company within the Group.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formula.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimates, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take into account any market conditions applicable to the option.
Further descriptions of the Groups share-based payment plans are given in note 34 of the Group financial statements.
87 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2006 1.
Changes in accounting policies and restatement of comparatives The prior year adjustments relate to the implementation of FRS 21, FRS 25 and FRS 26.
FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date This standard sets out amended requirements for accounting for events after the balance sheet date.
Following the introduction of this standard, dividends may only be recorded as a liability of the Company when a legal or constructive liability has been incurred.
This is likely to be when the dividend proposed by the Board is made public on the announcement of the Companys results.
Previously under UK GAAP, dividends were recorded in the period to which they relate, even if only proposed after the period end.
This has the effect of increasing the net assets of the Company by the amount of the proposed dividend at the 27 December 2005 of 46.1m.
FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation FRS 25 supersedes FRS 13 and substantially amends FRS 4 Capital instruments.
This standard is effective for the Company from 28 December 2005.
However, as the Group financial statements have been prepared under the IFRS equivalent standard IAS 32, the parent company is exempt from the disclosure requirements.
FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement FRS 26 applies for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and prescribes new accounting rules relating to financial instruments and hedge accounting.
This standard has been adopted in full in these financial statements and the requirement applied prospectively from 29 December 2004.
FRS 26 requires all derivative instruments to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value and allows the movements in fair values of the relevant derivative instrument but not the related borrowings to be recognised directly in reserves and therefore not impact earnings.
The impact of this standard is to reflect a liability in the balance sheet at 27 December 2005 of 1.6m as well as a related deferred tax asset of 0.5m offset by corresponding entries in a new hedging reserve.
Directors remuneration and interests The Company had no employees other than directors during the current or prior period.
The Company did not operate any pension schemes during the current or prior period.
Details of directors remuneration and other entitlements which form part of these financial statements are given in the parts of the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 22 to 25, which are described as having been audited.
