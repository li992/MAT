Contingent liabilities From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of such claims and actions.
a Regulatory issues As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA on 13 October 2006, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US and barred such customers from wagering real money on all of the Groups sites.
Notwithstanding this, the aggressive public statements made by certain US regulatory authorities suggest that there remains a residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in the US prior to the enactment of the UIGEA.
Furthermore, the Group is aware of press speculation that certain US regulatory authorities have made enquiries of banks and other financial advisers that have had involvement with the internet gaming industry.
Certain customary indemnities have been given by the Company to its advisers in connection with the Companys initial public offering in June 2005 and other assignments, and claims under such indemnities cannot be ruled out.
The Group has not, however, received notice of any such claim to date.
b Litigation The Group is the defendant in a US action which is based on alleged collusion taking place on the Groups online poker tables.
This action has been brought by two individual plaintiffs who are seeking class certification.
The class seeking to be represented comprises poker customers in the US who from 1 January 2002 played real money games on the Groups sites.
The Group believes the action to be without merit, but has not submitted to US jurisdiction and therefore the action has not been contested.
The Group has received legal advice that, having not submitted to US jurisdiction, any eventual US default judgement could not be enforced in territories where the Group has its principal assets and new substantive proceedings would need to be brought on the merits in such territories.
The Group believes it has strong defences and any such proceedings, if they were to be brought, would be vigorously defended.
The Board believes that a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential liability in connection with each of the above matters cannot be made and consequently no provision has been made.
