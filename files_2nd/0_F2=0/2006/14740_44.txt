Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2006 81 28.
EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Scottish and Southern Energy Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Details of these schemes are as follows: i Discretionary share option scheme In the past, the Company operated this scheme, under which senior executives and staff were awarded share options.
The options granted to the senior executives from 1996 were subject to the performance criterion of normalised earnings per share over a three-year period showing average compound annual growth rate of at least 2% above the increase in the UK retail price index for that year.
This criterion was met and any remaining discretionary share options are now exercisable.
This scheme has now ended and no options have been granted under this scheme since 1998. ii Savings-related share option schemes Sharesave This scheme gives employees the option to purchase shares in the Company at a discounted market price, subject to the employees remaining in employment for the term of the agreement.
Employees may opt to save between 5 and 250 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this period, the employees have six months to exercise their options by using the cash saved including a bonus equivalent to interest.
If the option is not exercised, the funds may be withdrawn by the employee and the option expires.
iii Share Incentive Plan SIP This scheme allows employees the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company on a monthly basis.
Employees may nominate an amount between 10 and 125 to be deducted from their gross salary.
This is then used to purchase shares Partnership shares in the market on the final business day of each month.
These shares are then held in trust for a period of five years, at which point they are transferred at no further cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during the five years, but tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
In addition to the shares purchased on behalf of the employee, the Company will also match the purchase up to a maximum of five shares Matching shares per month.
Again these shares are held in trust for the five years until they are transferred to the employee.
If an employee leaves during the first three years, or removes his her partnership shares, these matching shares are forfeited.
In addition, at 31 March 2005 the company made a special award of 50 free shares to all employees in employment at both 31 March and 20 August 2005 in recognition of their contribution to the success of the company.
Under the arrangements for the award, the shares will be held in trust for five years, at which point they will be transferred to the employees at no cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during years four and five, but tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
iv Deferred bonus scheme This scheme applies to senior managers and executive directors.
Those eligible are awarded an amount equal to their cash bonus for the period which is adjusted by a multiplier of between 0.7 and 1.35 depending on three factors, namely: relative performance in terms of Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three-year period compared to the FTSE100: safety: and relative performance in terms of customer complaints as recorded by energywatch.
This amount is then used to purchase shares in the market which are held in trust on behalf of the employee for a period of three-years, at which point the employee is entitled to exercise the award.
In addition to shares purchased using the adjusted bonus award, additional shares will also be purchased using any dividends received on the shares held by the trust.
If the employee resigns, they lose all outstanding awards.
As allowed by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002, which were unvested at 1 January 2005, have been included.
