EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by the Groups cash flow statement and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortisation, which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods particularly when acquisitions have occurred or non-operating factors.
Accordingly, EBITDA has been disclosed in this document to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our operating performance relative to other companies and of our ability to service our debt.
EBITDA is one of the key measures that we use to assess our success in achieving growth and operational efficiencies.
See the reconciliation of Group operating profit to EBITDA in note 2 to the financial statements.
EBITDA comprises total Group operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, both being non-cash items.
Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2006 excluded costs of 4.4 million arising from the TransWestern acquisition, and an exceptional credit of 5.0 million from releasing a provision for IPO costs.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional one-off items comprising 36.5 million of lawsuit costs associated with a Yellow Book advertising campaign in the year ended 31 March 2005 and a 5.8 million adjustment to goodwill for previously unrecognised net operating losses.
b Capital expenditure represents cash expenditure on property, plant and equipment, net of sales proceeds.
