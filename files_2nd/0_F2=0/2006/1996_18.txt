Notes to the Company financial statements C1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
There is no material difference between the profit on ordinary activities before taxation and the retained profit for the year and their historical cost equivalents.
The principal activity of the Company is to act as a holding company.
Adoption of new Accounting Standards and pronouncements Adoption of FRS 20 Share-based payments From 1 May 2005, the Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 20 Share-based payments.
Grants under The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan fall within the scope of FRS 20.
The accounting treatment under FRS 20 is similar to the previous treatment under UITF 17 revised 2003 in respect of the calculation of the cost of the awards at their fair value at the date of grant, which is recognised on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Companys estimates of the awards that will eventually vest.
The Company has elected to take the optional exemption from applying FRS 20 in the comparative year and to first apply it at 1 May 2005 and for the year ended 30 April 2006.
There is no impact on the financial statements of applying FRS 20 on the implementation of these standards at 1 May 2005.
Adoption of FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date From 1 May 2005, the Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 21 Events after the balance sheet date.
FRS 21 requires that dividends approved after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date since the liability did not represent an obligation at that date, and that dividends for which the right to receive payment has not been established at the balance sheet date should not be recognised as an asset at the balance sheet date.
This change has no impact on the balance sheet of the Company at the date of incorporation, at 30 April 2005 or at 30 April 2006.
Adoption of other new Accounting Standards and pronouncements The following Accounting Standards, which were issued during the year, have been adopted by the Company with no significant impact on these financial statements, including the comparatives: FRS 22 Earnings per Share, FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, FRS 24 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies, FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement, FRS 27 Life assurance and FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
Disclosures under FRS 25 in respect of the financial risks of the Company are covered by the disclosures set out in Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Investments The parent companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Deferred taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable and have not been discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet dates.
Pension costs Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
For the defined benefit pension scheme, a valuation is performed every three years.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and accordingly accounts for the plan as if it was a defined contribution plan.
Share-based payments The fair value of awards under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plans are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Groups estimate of awards that will eventually vest.
Shares held in trust to satisfy these awards are treated as a deduction from shareholders funds.
