SSLs management considers IFRS at 1 April 2004, the date of transition, the following the following to be the most important accounting policies optional exemptions from full retrospective application of in the context of the Groups operations.
IFRS accounting policies have been adopted: i Business combinations: The provisions of IFRS 3 have been applied prospectively from 1 April 2004. Business combinations that occurred before 1 April 2004 have not been restated.
ii Employee benefits: The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the date of transition to IFRS.
Going forward, we will apply the rules of the amendment to IAS 19 issued in December 2004, which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
This approach is consistent with the treatment required by the UK standard FRS 17, which was adopted by the Group during the year ended 31 March 2005.

Deferred tax income statement amounts in the year arise principally in respect of the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
In 2005 deferred tax income of 3.6 million also arose due to a carry-forward of unused tax losses.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates as the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and no tax is expected to be payable on earnings in the foreseeable future.

The financial instruments disclosures in note 24 detail the fair value hedge relationships between the Groups fixed rate loans and interest rate swaps.
Following the implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39, certain loans outstanding at 31 March 2006 are reported at their fair value.
Loan notes, interest rate and currency swaps held as a fair value hedge The following table shows the carrying values of loan notes, interest rate and currency swaps forming part of a fair value hedge relationship under IFRS.
2006 2005 Under IFRS Under IFRS including IAS 32 excluding IAS 32 Under IFRS and 39 and 39 m m m Loan notes: US$ 8.02% guaranteed 11.9 14.7 17.3 Currency swap: US$ 8.02% loan notes to Euro 6.09% fixed rate borrowing 1.5 3.1 Interest rate swap: Euro 6.09% fixed rate to Euro variable rate borrowing 0.1 0.5 13.3 17.3 17.3 The loan notes, interest rate and currency swaps held as a fair value hedge are carried at fair value under IFRS.
Under IFRS excluding IAS 32 and 39 the loans were held at amortised cost retranslated at the Euro rate, recognising 3.0 million of the swap fair value.
The notional amount of the US$ 8.02 per cent Guaranteed Loan Notes is US$20.3 million 2005: US$27.1 million.
The US$ 8.02 per cent loan notes were issued in November 1999, and are repayable in eight further equal instalments maturing in November 2009.
The loan notes are not secured on any assets of the Group.
The notional amount and payment terms of loan notes and swaps are equal.
The hedge effectiveness, tested semi-annually, was 99.5 per cent effective throughout the year in providing a hedge against fair value adjustments relating to interest rate changes.
The fair value charge in the year arising from movements in interest rates was nil.
Other loan notes, interest rate and currency swaps 2006 2005 Under IFRS Under IFRS including IAS 32 excluding IAS 32 Under IFRS and 39 and 39 m m m Loan notes: Sterling 7.87% guaranteed 5.9 6.4 6.4 Loan notes: US$ 8.19% guaranteed 60.1 58.8 67.4 Currency swap: US$ 8.19% loan notes to Sterling 7.69% fixed rate borrowing 4.0 7.5 70.0 72.7 73.8 The Sterling 7.87 per cent and US$ 8.19 per cent Guaranteed Loan Notes are held at amortised cost retranslated at spot under IFRS.
The currency swap is carried at fair value under IFRS.
Under IFRS excluding IAS 32 and 39 the US$ 8.19 per cent loans were held at amortised cost retranslated at the swap to Sterling rate of 1.65.
This recognised 8.6 million of the swap fair value.
The notional amount of the Sterling 7.87 per cent loan notes is 5.9 million 2005: 6.4 million.
The notional amount of the US$ 8.19 per cent loan notes is US$104.2 million 2005: US$111.2 million.
The Sterling loan notes were issued in November 1999 and are repayable, in full, in November 2014.
The US$ loan notes were issued in November 1999 and are repayable, in full, in November 2009.
The fair value of the 7.89 per cent guaranteed loan notes, held at amortised cost, is 6.2 million 2005: 6.6 million.
The fair value of the 8.19% guaranteed loan notes, also held at cost, is 59.7 million 2005: 62.0 million.
The loans and swaps do not constitute a fair value hedge under IFRS.
Consequently the Group is exposed to fair value changes from interest rate movements in the US$ and Sterling.
These fair value changes have resulted in a charge of 2.1 million in the income statement for the year.
The Groups exposure to fair value changes is considered further in note 24.

The total provision has remained unchanged at 41.2 million.
Overseas termination benefits A number of the Groups overseas subsidiaries provide for termination benefits payable to employees.
Benefits accrue with service and are payable to employees upon departure from the Group regardless of the reason for such departure.
Benefits may be calculated with reference to an average salary over the service life of the employee or the final salary of the employee.
The increase in benefit arising from the current years service and any increase relating to previous years service due to increase in salary are taken through the income statement.
The calculation of the provision is determined by contractual obligation and therefore can be estimated reliably.
No terminations are expected in the next year.
Disposals Following the Groups disposal of the medical business, in 2004 and 2005, a number of disposal provisions were created for the ongoing commitments of the Group in respect of the disposals.
The Group has continued to utilise these provisions during the current year.
It is expected that all remaining provisions will be utilised during the next year.
Manufacturing restructuring During 2005 the Group announced its decision to close the Derby manufacturing plant and transfer production to India.
This process remains ongoing and the amounts provided reflect the future expected costs of completing this transfer.
1.8 million of the provision, shown as non-current, relates to a provision for an onerous lease.
It is expected that all other provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
Group and commercial restructuring The Group has continued in the current year with its rationalisation and restructuring of commercial operations.
Provisions brought forward have been utilised in full, with new amounts being charged and spent in part during the year.
The closing provision represents staff costs associated with the continued restructuring.
It is expected that the provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
Other Other provisions relate to a number of pre-merger environmental provisions, surplus property provisions and any other obligations following previous acquisitions.
Environmental provisions are provided for to the extent that a present obligation exists, it is probable such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
No provision is made for possible additional costs that are not currently probable.
Surplus property costs of 3.7 million have been classified as non-current.

The fair value of interest rate swaps at 1 April 2005 was adjusted against retained earnings at that date.
This amounted to a loss of 10.1 million.
The fair value adjustment relating to loans that form part of designated fair value hedge relationships at 1 April 2005 was a gain of 2.6 million.
Other fair value adjustments to loans on adoption resulted in gains of 8.6 million note 17.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps recognised as hedges at 31 March 2006 is a net liability of 1.4m comprising assets of 25.1 million and liabilities of 26.5 million.
From 1 April 2005 interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges are fair valued through the income statement as part of net finance expense.
Underlying loans that form part of fair value hedge relationships are adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk through income statement to offset any mark to market arising on the interest rate swaps.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all fair value hedges at inception and effectiveness is carried out semi-annually.
All designated hedges have remained effective throughout the current financial year.

d Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used, applied consistently, in estimating the fair value of financial instruments reflected in the tables in section b : Derivatives The fair value of all derivatives are estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve valuation techniques based on rates prevailing at the year end in the relevant currencies.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of all loans are estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve valuation techniques based on rates prevailing at the year end in the relevant currencies.
A credit spread is added to yield curves to obtain an accurate basis for fair value.
Trade and other receivables payables For all other receivables and payables, categorised as financial assets or liabilities under IAS 39, but not presented within financial assets or liabilities in these financial statements, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
e Credit risk Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded derivatives.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, which is reviewed annually, and reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through use of these instruments.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments with a positive carrying value at the balance sheet date.
The Group deposits central funds, when available, with highly rated banks in line with Group policy.
The central funds on deposit at the balance sheet date were 6.6 million 2005: 12.3 million.

Provision has been made in the Group financial statements for the environmental clean-up costs for this property and the remaining US property owned by the Group based on the Directors best estimates of such costs according to information currently available.
It is not possible to estimate with certainty the extent of any further liability that may arise.
Litigation The Group is involved in a small number of lawsuits in the USA alleging the development of sensitivities to natural rubber latex.
All the lawsuits relate to SSLs medical gloves business, which SSL sold in 2004.
Responsibility for the consequences if any of such litigation, including legal liability and costs, will remain with the Group for products manufactured and or sold prior to completion of the disposal of the medical gloves business.
There remain very few outstanding cases, and no new lawsuits have commenced against the Group in the last three years.
The Directors believe that the Group has defences available to any such claims.
A provision exists as at 31 March 2006 in respect of the existing and continuing claims.
The Directors believe the provision is adequate.
The Group is also a defendant in a number of other lawsuits incidental to its operations which, in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Group.
Office of Fair Trading In April 2005 the OFT announced that it would review certain undertakings given in 1994 by LRC Products Limited now a subsidiary of the Company, following a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report of that year, that it would no longer enter into exclusive distribution agreements with wholesalers or retailers in respect of Durex products.
In its report to the Competition Commission dated 14 December 2005, the OFT recommended that SSL be released from the 1994 undertakings.
On 25 April 2006, the Competition Commission announced that it has accepted the OFTs advice and that therefore LRC Products Limited is now released from the undertakings.

SSL International plc Annual Report and Accounts Notes to the Consolidated 2006 Financial Statements 29 Explanation of transition to IFRS From 1 April 2005 the Group has been reporting its results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The transition date for SSL of adoption of IFRS is 1 April 2004.
All comparative data in this report has been restated, except the Group has taken the exemption under IFRS 1 not to restate the comparatives for IAS 32 and 39.
To comply with the requirements of reporting the first set of annual results following transition to IFRS, reconciliation of profit and loss under UK GAAP is the income and expense under IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2005, set out below.

A summary of the principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS as applicable to SSL International is as follows: a Reclass of discontinued and other items Under IFRS the results of discontinued operations may be classified in one line on the face of the income statement rather than within each income statement category as is required under UK GAAP.
This has no overall impact on the results for the Group and is a reclassification only.
b Share-based payments The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payments only to relevant share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 as permitted under IFRS 1.
The Group operates a number of share-based incentive schemes that are impacted by IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
Under UK GAAP no expense has been recognised for awards under the Executive share option scheme, as the intrinsic value of the options was nil.
No charge was recognised for awards under the SAYE scheme, as this was exempt under UITF 17.
Under IFRS, an expense is recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments.
This expense has been calculated based upon the fair value at the date of the awards using appropriate option pricing models.
This has resulted in a charge for the full year of 0.6 million, recognised within administrative expenses.
The tax impact of the charge has been considered in adjustment c iii.
80 81 SSL International plc Annual Report and Accounts Notes to the Consolidated 2006 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued c Income taxes i IAS 12 changes the methodology used to calculate deferred tax on unrealised profit on intra-group sales.
This has resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of 3.4 million at 31 March 2004 based upon unrealised profit held in tax paying jurisdictions.
The movement on this asset to 31 March 2005 leads to a credit in the income statement of 0.3 million.
ii IAS 12 requires a deferred tax provision for all rolled over capital gains.
The treatment under IAS 12 of deferred tax on rolled over capital gains has resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of 11.5 million as at 1 April 2004.
Of this amount 7.2 million had already been recorded within current tax creditor under UK GAAP.
This has, as such, been reclassified from the current tax creditor to deferred tax and a further 4.3 million booked.
Following disposal of the medical business, 7.7 million of the liability is released in the year to 31 March 2006, following crystallisation of the gain.
A current tax charge in relation to this amount is already recognised under UK GAAP but offsets versus current year losses.
Provision is made for 7.7 million for possible taxable gains that could arise in the US on the disposal of the medical business.
Both entries are classified in discontinued operations.
At 31 March 2005 a deferred tax asset of 3.8 million is set up for agreed capital losses to offset the remaining deferred tax liability.
This is recognised outside the normal business as the losses recognised do not form part of normal trading.
iii IAS 12 requires a deferred tax asset to be recognised in respect of the cumulative charge on share-based payments which would have been deemed to have hit the profit and loss account or reserves.
A deferred tax asset of 0.2 million at 1 April 2004 and 0.2 million at 30 September 2004 is recognised.
A deferred tax asset of 0.3 million is recognised as at 31 March 2005.
A tax credit of 0.1 million is taken to the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Since the production of Restatement of financial information under International Accounting Standards, published on 28 September 2005 and available from The Company Secretary, 35 New Bridge Street, London EC4V 6BW, the total deferred tax assets for the comparative year has been increased by 4.1 million to 41.1 million.
Tax liabilities, for which no payment is expected to be made within 12 months from the balance sheet date, totalling 20.2 million have been reclassified as non-current.
d Goodwill amortisation Under IFRS 3, goodwill is no longer amortised on a straight line basis, but instead is subject to annual impairment review.
Amortisation previously charged is frozen at the date of transition.
Goodwill amortisation of 2.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 is written back to the income statement.
Of this amount, 1.0 million is in relation to the continuing business and 1.0 million is in relation to the discontinued business.
In the year ended 31 March 2005 an additional charge of 2.3 million was charged within the continuing business following impairment reviews of certain items of goodwill under UK GAAP.
This charge has been retained under IFRS.
e Dividend Under UK GAAP the dividend charge is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period to which it relates.
Under IFRS the dividend is not recognised in the income statement but is recognised directly to reserves in the period in which the dividend is declared.
Both the interim and final dividend for the year have been reversed from the income statement with an impact of 11.8 million.
f Reclass Under IFRS the results of discontinued operations may be classified in one line within the income statement rather than within each income statement category as is required under UK GAAP.
g Para 20 items Under FRS 3 certain items were required to be disclosed separately below operating profit.
Under IFRS these will be reclassed above the operating profit line.
h Goodwill Under IFRS 3 goodwill is no longer amortised on a straight line basis, but instead is subject to annual impairment review.
