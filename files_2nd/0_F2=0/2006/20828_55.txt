In addition, there are arrangements whereby the ESOT will provide upto 1,389,582 Performance Share Plan PSP shares, normally not until 2009, 2010 or 2011.

The market value of Amlin plc ordinary shares at 31 December 2006 was 325.25p per share 2005: 248.5p.
The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements.
The ESOT waives the right to dividends in excess of 0.01p per each share ranking for an interim or final dividend.
The weighted average share price of Amlin plc throughout the year was 269.9 pence 2005: 186.3 pence The Black Scholes option pricing model has been used to determine the fair value of the option grants listed above.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price 185.43p 156.64p Weighted average exercise price 159.02p 134.73p Expected volatility 30.0% 30.0% Expected life years 3.25 7.5 3.25 7.5 Risk free rate of return 4.30% - 4.50% 4.30% - 4.50% Expected dividend yield 2.00% - 5.00% 2.00% - 5.00% Volatility The volatility of the Amlin share price is calculated as a normalised standard deviation of the log of the daily return on the share price.
In estimating a 30% volatility, the volatility of return for six months, one year and three year intervals are considered.
As a guide to the reasonableness of the volatility estimate similar calculations are performed on a selection of Amlins peer group.
Interest rate The risk free interest rate is consistent with government bond yields.
Dividend yield The assumptions are consistent with the information given in the report and accounts for each relevant valuation year.
Staff turnover The option pricing calculations are split by staffing grades as staff turnover is higher for more junior grades.
Furthermore historical evidence suggests that senior employees tend to hold their options for longer whereas more junior levels within the organisation appear to exercise earlier.
In addition senior employees hold a larger proportion of the options but represent a smaller group of individuals.
Market conditions Amlin issues options that include targets for the Groups performance against a number of market and non-market conditions.
Failure to meet these targets can reduce the number of options exercisable.
In some circumstances no options may be exercised.
Assumptions are made about the likelihood of meeting the market and non-market conditions based on the outlook at the time of each option grant.
