Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below.
a Basis of accounting The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by, or adopted by, the International Accounting Standards Board the IASB, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee, guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of Guernsey Law and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The following new standards have been issued but are not effective for 2006 and have not been early adopted: In August 2005, the IASB issued IFRS 7 FinancialInstruments:Disclosureswhich becomes effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The standard requires disclosures about the significance of financial instruments for an entitys financial position and performance.
These disclosures incorporate many of the requirements of IAS 32 FinancialInstruments:.
IFRS 7 also requires information about the extent to which the entity is exposed to risks arising from financial instruments, and a description of managements objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks.
The Group will apply IFRS 7 for its accounting period commencing 1 January 2007.
In November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8 OperatingSegments which becomes effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard requires disclosure on the financial performance of the Groups operating segments.
The Group will apply IFRS 8 for its accounting period commencing 1 January 2009.
The Group does not consider that the future adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, in the form currently available, will have any material impact on the financial statements as presented.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are those entities, including special purpose entities, controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
c Revenue recognition Rental income, excluding VAT, arising on investment properties is accounted for in the Income Statement on a straightline basis over the lease term of ongoing leases.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Distribution income received from the indirect property funds is recognised in the period to which the payment relates.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs and all other expenses are charged through the Income Statement.
e Taxation Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
f Investment properties Investment property consists of land and buildings held to earn rental income together with the potential for capital and income growth.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given, including transaction costs associated with the investment property.
Any subsequent capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the period during which the expenditure is incurred and included within the book cost of the property.
After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Income Statement and transferred to the Capital Reserve Unrealised.
Fair value is based on the open market valuation provided by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, chartered surveyors, at the balance sheet date.
Accounting policies continued f Investment properties continued Investment properties held under finance leases and leased out under operating leases are classified as investment properties and stated at fair value.
On derecognition, realised gains and losses on disposals of investment properties are recognised in the Income Statement and transferred to the Capital Reserve Realised.
Recognition and derecognition occurs on the exchange of signed contracts between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
g Investments Investments in unquoted indirect property funds are recognised and derecognised on the trade date, and are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs on acquisition are included within the initial recognition and the profit or loss on disposal is calculated net of transaction costs on disposal.
Investments in unquoted indirect property funds are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
h Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business being property investment business and in one geographical area, the United Kingdom.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash in banks and short term deposits that are held to maturity are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short term deposits in banks with an original maturity of three months or less.
j Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
k Interest-bearing borrowings All non-current borrowings are initially recognised as cost, being fair value of the consideration received, net of arrangement costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, all interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any loan arrangement costs and any discount or premium on settlement.

The Company is exempt from Guernsey taxation under the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989.
A fixed annual fee of 600 is payable to the States of Guernsey in respect of this exemption.
No charge to Guernsey taxation will arise on capital gains.
The Directors intend to conduct the Groups affairs such that the management and control is not exercised in the United Kingdom and so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries carries on any trade in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries will not be liable for United Kingdom taxation on their income or gains other than certain income deriving from a United Kingdom source.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United Kingdom income tax on income arising on the property portfolio after deduction of its allowable debt financing costs and other allowable expenses.

Although these payments relate to the year ended 31 December 2006, under International Financial Reporting Standards they will be accounted for in the year ending 31 December 2007, being the year during which they are paid.
Earnings per share The Group earnings per Ordinary Share are based on the net profit for the year of 220,411,000 2005: 152,484,000 and on 735,000,000 2005: 735,000,000 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The Company earnings per Ordinary Share are based on the net profit for the year of 35,506,000 2005: 28,669,000 and on 735,000,000 2005: 735,000,000 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Investments Company Group 2006 2005 2006 2005 000 000 000 000 Freehold and leasehold properties Opening book cost 795,722 Opening unrealised appreciation 113,173 Opening valuation 908,895 Purchases 791,425 975 791,425 Sales proceeds 802,540 23,237 gain on sale 11,115 4,202 Capital expenditure 4,836 4,297 Movement in unrealised appreciation 151,309 113,173 1,046,980 908,895 Closing book cost 782,498 795,722 Closing unrealised appreciation 264,482 113,173 Closing valuation 1,046,980 908,895 Company Group 2006 2005 2006 2005 000 000 000 000 Indirect property funds Opening book cost 133,947 Opening unrealised appreciation 20,277 Opening valuation 154,224 Purchases 133,947 Movement in unrealised appreciation 27,653 20,277 181,877 154,224 Closing book cost 133,947 133,947 Closing unrealised appreciation 47,930 20,277 Closing valuation 181,877 154,224 DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited completed a valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2006 on an open market basis in accordance with the requirements of the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is deemed to equate to fair value.
Fair value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amounts for which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The value of these investment properties amounted to 1,046,980,000 2005: 908,895,000.
The Group has adopted IAS 40 revised 2003, allowing leasehold properties to be carried at fair value rather than amortised over the term of the lease.
The same valuation criteria are therefore applied to leasehold as freehold properties.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
The property valuer is independent and external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation, when the Managers advise the presence of such materials.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 29 Notes to the Accounts continued 9.
Investments continued The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 21 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
The 10 largest properties per open market value are shown on page 9.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise as described in Liquidity risk, note 19.
The Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to its investment properties.
The indirect property funds are valued at fair value, being the net asset value of the underlying holdings.
Investment in subsidiary undertaking The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Group also consolidates the results of F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited, a special purpose vehicle incorporated to issue the interest bearing bonds.

The Directors of the Company received fees for their services.
Further details are provided in the Report of the Directors on page 13 and in note 3 on page 26.
No fees remained payable at the year end.
Financial instruments The Groups investment objective is to provide ordinary shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for capital and income growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments comprise interest bearing bonds, cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not have exposure to any derivative instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and have remained unchanged for the year under review.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2006 is 2,099,000 2005: 2,178,000.
There is no credit risk associated with the financial liabilities of the Group.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise both direct and indirect holdings in UK commercial property.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
The Groups investments include investments in indirect property funds which are not traded in an organised public market and which generally may be illiquid.
As a result the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in these instruments in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations.
These consist of 230 million Secured Bonds due 2017 on which the rate has been fixed at 5.23 per cent until the expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.6 per cent over LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 33 Notes to the Accounts continued 19.
Financial instruments continued The following table sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk.
Assets Weighted liabilities Weighted average where no average period for Fixed Variable interest is interest which rate Total rate rate received rate is fixed Type 000 000 000 000 % years As at 31 December 2006 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 53,291 53,291 4.54 Trade and other receivables 6,217 6,217 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 228,993 228,993 5.29 8.5 As at 31 December 2005 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 41,680 41,680 4.18 Trade and other receivables 4,563 4,563 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 228,899 228,899 5.29 9.5 Apart from the 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds as disclosed in note 14, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value in the financial statements.
Foreign currency risk There is no foreign currency risk as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds sterling.
Capital commitments The Group has capital commitments totalling 186,000 as at 31 December 2006 2005: 1,921,000.
As at 31 December 2006 the Group had entered into an agreement to sell 749,264 units in The Mall LP for a consideration of 1,875,000, representing a premium of 0.6 per cent to the carrying value at 31 December 2006.
The sale concluded on 15 January 2007.
The Company did not have any capital commitments at 31 December 2006 2005: nil.
Lease length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The future income based on the unexpired lessor lease length at the year end was as follows based on annual rentals : Company Group 2006 2005 2006 2005 000 000 000 000 Less than one year 607 1,349 Between two and five years 32,071 26,858 Over five years 452,016 475,332 Total 484,694 503,539 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 5.3 per cent 2005: 5.2 per cent of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of estimated total rental value excluding indirect property funds was 2.1 per cent 2005: 2.8 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
Analyses of the nature of investment properties and leases are provided in the Managers Review on pages 5 to 8.
