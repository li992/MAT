The impact of this in 2006 is to reduce profit in Central Europe by 3.9m, increase the loss in Mexico by 0.5m and reduce costs in UK and Ireland by 4.4m.
The results shown above for 2005 have been restated to reflect the results as though a similar basis of cost allocation had been adopted.
Accordingly, the 2005 profit in Central Europe has been reduced by 3.5m, the 2005 loss in Mexico has been increased by 0.2m and costs in UK and Ireland in 2005 have been reduced by 3.7m.
These changes have no impact on reported group or international profits.
