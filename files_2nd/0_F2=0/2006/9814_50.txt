The revaluation adjustment reflects the valuation of the acquired estate as at 17 March 2006.
The valuation was carried out by independent chartered surveyors Christie & Co on an open market value basis.
Deferred tax on property revaluations has been recognised on acquisition.
The other fair value adjustments reflect the elimination of prepaid finance costs on borrowings, the market value of the swap instrument at acquisition date, deferred tax in respect of tax losses which are available for offset against future trading profits and deferred tax on the elimination of finance costs.
The net cash outflow in respect of the acquisition of Celtic Inns was: m Acquisition of equity Cash 17.6 Net overdrafts of subsidiary 0.8 18.4 Acquisition of debt Immediate repayment of subsidiarys debt 10.0 Net cash outflow in respect of the acquisition 28.4 The purchase agreement for Celtic Inns required the immediate repayment of certain borrowings, which were included in its balance sheet at the date of acquisition.
The debt repayments have therefore been classified as part of the overall consideration for the acquisition of Celtic Inns.
In the financial year to 27 August 2005, Celtic Inns made a loss after tax of 0.5m.
For the period from 28 August 2005 to 16 March 2006, Celtic Inns recorded revenue of 5.6m, operating profit of 1.5m, profit before taxation of 1.2m and profit after taxation of 1.0m.
There is no difference between profit after taxation and the recognised income and expenses for that period.
Since acquisition, the cash operations of Celtic Inns have been integrated into the existing Group financial statements.
As a result, it is impractical to isolate the cash flows of Celtic Inns.
