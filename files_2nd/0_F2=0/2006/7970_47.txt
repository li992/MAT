Translation reserve The Translation reserve is used to record foreign exchange rate changes relating to the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries arising after 1 January 2004.
It is also used to record foreign exchange differences arising on long term foreign currency borrowings used to finance or hedge foreign currency investments.
Hedging reserve For cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders equity.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
