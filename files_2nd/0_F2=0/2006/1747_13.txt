Babcock International Group PLC 43 Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The comparative consolidated financial information previously published under UK GAAP has been restated on an IFRS basis for the opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 and for the year ended 31 March 2005.
A description of how the groups reported results and financial position are affected by this change, including reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS for prior year results is disclosed in note 37 to these accounts.
First time adoption of IFRS The groups date of transition to IFRS was 1 April 2004.
IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards generally requires companies to apply their accounting policies retrospectively.
There are however a number of exemptions from this general rule in order to assist companies with the transition to reporting under IFRS.
The most significant of these are set out below: Business combinations The group has elected not to restate business combinations prior to the date of transition.
Employee benefits All cumulative actuarial gains and losses have been recognised on transition to IFRS.
The group will continue to apply this treatment, with all actuarial gains and losses being recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in compliance with IAS19 Employee Benefits.
Financial instruments The group has adopted the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement but to apply these standards from 1 April 2005.
As a result the comparative information to the 2006 financial statements is presented on a UK GAAP basis.
A reconciliation between the closing 31 March 2005 balance sheet and the opening 1 April 2005 balance sheet is shown in note 38.
Cumulative translation differences The group has elected to adopt the Cumulative translation exchange differences exemption which resets all cumulative translation gains and losses to zero at the date of transition.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted by the group are disclosed below: Basis of consolidation The group financial statements comprise the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March.
a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition and the results of the businesses disposed of or terminated are included in the results for the year up to the date of relinquishing control or closure and analysed as continuing or discontinued operations.
b Joint ventures The groups interest in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The groups investment in jointly controlled entities includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identified on acquisition.
The groups share of its jointly controlled entities post-acquisition profits or losses after tax is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the group and its jointly controlled entity are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the joint controlled entity.
Exceptional items Items that are both material and non-recurring, are presented as exceptional items within the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include gains or losses on the disposal of properties and businesses along with the restructuring of businesses and asset impairments.
Babcock International Group PLC 44 Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Goodwill and intangible assets a Goodwill When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking exceeds the fair value of its separable net assets the difference is treated as purchased goodwill and is capitalised.
When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking is less than the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is taken directly to the income statement.
Goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004 is maintained at its net book value on the date of transition to IFRS.
From that date goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed at least annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill was written off to reserves on the date of transition to IFRS.
b Acquired intangibles Intangible assets, which are capable of being recognised separately and measured reliably on acquisition of a business, are capitalised at fair value on acquisition.
These intangibles will include contracts and customer relationships.
Where these assets have a finite life, they are amortised over the period which they are expected to generate benefits, but generally not exceeding ten years.
Customer contracts and relationships valued on acquisition are expected to generate higher benefits in the early years following such acquisition as the existing contracts unwind.
c Research and development Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and only if the cost can be measured reliably.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is available for use on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit but not exceeding seven years.
d Computer software Computer software costs are amortised over their expected useful lives of between three and five years.
Property, plant and equipment PPE Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of PPE over the estimated useful lives to their estimated residual value reassessed at each balance sheet date at the following annual rates: Freehold land Nil Freehold property 2% to 8% Short leasehold property lease term Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6.6% to 33.3% Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount exceeds the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell or value in use.
Leases Assets under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding capital element of instalments is included in borrowings.
The interest element is charged against profits so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Depreciation is calculated to write the assets off over their expected useful lives or over the lease terms where these are shorter.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
A provision is made where the operating leases are deemed to be onerous.
Stocks and work in progress Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in first-out method.
In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Contract accounting Contract costs are recognised when incurred.
When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recovered.
When the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will be profitable, contract revenue is recognised over the period of the contract.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
The group uses the percentage of completion method to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognised in a given period.
The group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings.
The group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses.
Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it can be reliably expected that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows.
Babcock International Group PLC 45 Annual report and accounts 2006 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Taxation a Current income tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
b Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in local currency at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the local currency at the year end exchange rates.
a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the companys functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as part of the net investment of a foreign operation.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the balance sheets and income statements of foreign operations into Sterling are recognised as a separate component of equity on consolidation.
Results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated using the average exchange rate for the month of the applicable results.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period end exchange rates.
Revenue a Revenue in respect of contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract, using the percentage of completion method to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in a given period.
An appropriate level of profit attributable to the contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of the contract can be reliably assessed.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
b Other revenue comprises the fair value of goods and services rendered by the group.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Employee benefits a Pension obligations The group operates a number of pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The groups current and past service cost and imputed interest on the defined benefit schemes obligations, net of the expected return on the schemes assets, are charged to operating profit within the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity through the Statement of recognised income and expense so that the groups balance sheet reflects the fair value of the schemes surpluses of deficits at the balance sheet date.
b Share-based compensation The group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
The shares purchased by the groups ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity.
c Holiday pay Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned.
Babcock International Group PLC 46 Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments a From 1 April 2005 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
The group designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
For foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are deferred in equity until such time as the firm commitment is recognised, at which point any deferred gain or loss is included in the assets carrying amount.
These gains or losses are then realised through the income statement as the asset is sold.
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair values is recognised in the income statement immediately.
b From 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 The group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts, to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward currency exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged items and must also reduce the risk of foreign exchange movements on the groups operations.
Gains or losses on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the income statement, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, only when the hedged transaction has itself been recognised in the Financial Statements.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss is recognised at that time.
Financial risk management Financial instruments, in particular, forward currency contracts and interest swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the group and the financing of those activities.
Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate caps, each being reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the appropriate mix is maintained.
The groups main exposure to foreign currency fluctuations arise through its activities in South Africa where both translational and transactional exposure exist.
It is group policy not to cover the effects of exchange rate fluctuation on translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into the groups functional currency, Sterling.
All material transactional exposures arising through trading in currencies other than the operations functional currency must be eliminated by the use of forward cover contracts as soon as they are known of.
All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counter-parties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents.
The groups revenue is derived mainly from government or government backed institutions or blue chip corporations and as such credit risk is considered small.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The key areas of estimates and judgements for the group are contract accounting see above, the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes see note 27, impairment of goodwill see note12 and income tax recognition.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards that are not yet effective Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2006 or later periods but which the group has not early adopted.
Management has identified IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure effective years commencing 1 January 2007, IFRIC4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease effective years commencing 1 January 2006 and the amendment to IAS39 and IFRS4 Financial Guarantee Contracts effective years commencing 1 January 2006 as being relevant to its business.
The impact on the groups operations is currently being assessed.

The recoverable amount for all the cashgenerating units has been measured based on a value in use calculation derived from Board approved three year budgeted cash flows and extrapolated cash flows thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 2%.
A post-tax discount rate in the range 7% to 9% was used in the value in use calculation for the cash generating units within each segment.
The groups weighted average cost of capital is approximately 8%.
No reasonable change in the discount rate would give rise to an impairment.
The goodwill impairment in 2005 arose on the downsizing of the groups marine design business.

The interest rate on this liability is 6.0% and the maturity period is between seven and 23 years.
The weighted average interest rates of the Sterling fixed rate financial liabilities, which comprise financial lease obligations, are 6.2%.
The floating rate on financial assets and liabilities is linked to LIBOR in the case of Sterling, the prime rate in the case of South African Rand and the local prime rate for other currencies.
The group has entered into an interest rate swap to cap the LIBOR component of interest to 5.0% per annum.
This is in relation to 20.0 million of floating rate debt.
The interest rate swap is effective for three years from 26 June 2003.

Previous years FRS13 disclosure continued Currency exposures The accounting policy note 1 explains that it is the groups policy not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profits and net assets to Sterling.
Such movements are dealt with through the group statement of total recognised gains and losses.
It is group policy for subsidiaries to hedge transactional currency exposures against the currency in which their results are measured.
The table below shows the groups currency exposures, in other words, those transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
As at 31 March 2005, these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US Dollars Euro Swedish Krone Other Total Functional currency of group operation m m m m m m Sterling 0.9 1.7 0.4 3.0 Swedish Krone 0.5 - 0.5 Total 0.9 2.2 0.4 3.5 The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of forward foreign currency contracts entered in to manage these currency exposures.
As at 31 March 2005, the group also held open various foreign currency contract that the group had taken out to hedge expected future foreign currency movements.
Fair values Set out below is a comparison of the book and fair values of derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile of the groups operations.
In all other cases, there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the groups financial assets liabilities.
2005 2005 Book value Fair value Interest rate swaps 0.3 0.1 Forward foreign currency contracts 0.5 Changes in the value of the swaps as a result of changes in interest rates are not included in the book value of the relevant asset or liability.
The book value and the fair value of the groups borrowings and cash at bank are the same and are therefore not reflected in the above table.
Gains and losses on hedges The group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, immediately the transaction occurs.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the Financial Statements until the hedged position matures.
An analysis of these unrecognised gains and losses is as follows: Gains Losses Net m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2004 0.4 5.4 5.0 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year ended 31 March 2005 0.4 5.2 4.8 Gains and losses arising before 1 April 2004 that were not recognised in the year ended 31 March 2005 0.2 0.2 Gains and losses arising that were not recognised in the year ended 31 March 2005 0.5 0.8 0.3 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2005 0.5 1.0 0.5 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2006 0.5 1.0 0.5 In addition there is an unrecognised loss in respect of interest rate swaps of 0.2 million.
The above represents the gains and losses of hedging instruments.

Share based payments The charge to the income statement has been based on the assumptions below and is based on the binomial model as adjusted, allowing for a closed form numerical-integrated solution, which makes it analogous to the Monte Carlo simulations, including performance conditions.
The detailed description of the plans below is included within the Remuneration report.
During the year the total charge relating to employee share-based payment plans was 1.1 million 2005: 0.9 million all of which related to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
After tax, the income statement charge was 0.8 million 2005: 0.7 million.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last one to three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

During the year ended 31 March 2006 87,161 shares 2005: 193,528 shares were disposed by the Trusts resulting from options exercised.
At 31 March 2006, the Trusts held between them a total of 4,109,918 2005: 4,197,079 ordinary shares at a total market value of 13,090,089 2005: 6,253,648 representing 1.96% 2005: 2.01% of the issued share capital at that date.
The company elected to pay dividends to the Trust at the rate of 0.001p per share during the year, though full dividends were paid in respect of shares held by the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust.
All the Trusts shares are under option, the subject of L-TIP share awards to employees or represent a provision for future L-TIP vesting.
The company meets the operating expenses of the Trusts.
The Trusts enable shares in the company to be held or purchased and made available to employees through the grant and exercise of rights or awards under the Babcock 1999 Executive Share Option Schemes and the Babcock 2003 L-TIP.
The Trusts are discretionary settlements for the benefit of employees within the group.
The company is excluded from benefiting under them.
They are controlled and managed outside the UK and each has a single corporate trustee which is an independent trustee services organisation.
The right to remove and appoint the trustees rests ultimately with the company.
The trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust is required to waive both voting rights and dividends payable on any share in the company in excess of 0.001p, unless otherwise directed by the company, but the trustee of the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust does not have the power to waive dividends due on Babcock ordinary shares and therefore receives the full amount of any dividends declared.
Retirement benefits and liabilities The group has established a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are those in the UK.
Defined contributions schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Defined contribution schemes 7.5 7.4 Defined benefit schemes Balance sheet assets and liabilities recognised are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Retirement benefits funds in surplus 64.9 41.5 Retirement benefits funds in deficit 35.6 61.8 29.3 20.3 Babcock International Group PLC 66 Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Retirement benefits and liabilities continued The group operates three principal defined benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme, the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme and the First Engineering Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pensions Scheme.
All three schemes are funded by payments to separate trustee-administered funds and the level of the groups contributions to the schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, qualified actuaries.
The details of the latest formal actuarial valuations of these three schemes are as follows: Babcock International Rosyth Royal First Engineering Group Scheme Dockyard Scheme Scheme m m m Date of last formal actuarial valuation 01.04.04 31.03.03 31.12.04 Number of active members at 31 March 2006 528 1,229 843 Actuarial valuation method Projected unit Projected unit Attained age Results of formal actuarial valuation: Value of assets 404.8m 355.1m 121.4m Level of funding 114% 107% 96% Principal valuation assumptions: Excess of investment returns over earnings increases 1%2.5% 1.5% 0.5% 1.75% Excess of investment returns over pension increases 2.5%4% 3% 1.75%1.95% As a result of the level of surplus the groups required contribution to the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme is currently suspended until at least the results of the next formal valuation are available.
The group does however make voluntary payments to the scheme.
The contribution rates for the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Scheme is 8% of pensionable pay and the First Engineering Scheme is 11.5% to June 2006 and thereafter will increase.
During the year the Eve Group Scheme and the Jackson Group plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme were merged with the Babcock International Group Scheme.
In addition to the three principal defined benefit schemes referred to above, the group also operates a number of smaller defined pension schemes: The Babcock Holdings USA Inc Pension Plan for employees of US subsidiaries of Babcock Holdings USA Inc. A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005.
The company made a contribution of 232,000 during the year to 31 March 2006.
The plan was frozen as of 31 January 2003 and, therefore, no active members existed as at 31 March 2006.
The HMNB Clyde contract includes a contract specific defined benefit pension scheme where all funding risk is borne by the customer and hence the costs are included within the defined contribution analysis above.
The Unicorn Pension Scheme for employees in the SGI business, acquired by the company on 19 June 2002.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 December 2003.
The scheme was closed to new members from 30 November 2002 and there is no further accrual of benefits for future service.
All scheme members are in the process of transferring to the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme.
The company made no contributions to the scheme during the year to 31 March 2006.
As part of the Peterhouse acquisition three smaller defined benefit schemes were acquired: Jackson Group plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, Shorco Group Pension Scheme and AMT International Limited Pension Scheme.
All three schemes had no active members and all members have either transferred or are in the process of transferring to the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme.
18,000 2005: 150,000 was contributed to the Jackson Group Scheme during the year to 31 March 2006.

The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities under FRS17 are substantially consistent with the requirements of IAS19.
Although there are some minor technical differences, which result in a different income statement charge.
In accordance with IAS19, finance costs income will be shown within the operating profit and the retirement benefits and retirement liabilities are disclosed separately as is the related deferred tax asset also under IAS19, in the event of a significant reduction in active members, the effect on the surplus deficit is taken to the income statement immediately.
This has been shown as an exceptional gain of 5.6 million b IAS38 requires that intangible assets of an acquired business are separately recognised from goodwill if their fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets include contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets recognised are then amortised over their useful life.
Under the transition rules, the group is not required to identify any acquired intangible assets for acquisitions prior to 31 March 2004.
As a result of acquisitions made in 2004 5 the group has reclassified intangible assets of 25.9 million out of goodwill arising on acquisition.
There is an associated ordinary amortisation charge of 4.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 and in addition the amortisation of 8.8 million relating to the rail maintenance transfer which is treated as exceptional.
c In accordance with IFRS3, no amortisation of goodwill is charged in the groups consolidated IFRS accounts from 1 April 2004.
Instead, annual impairment reviews of the goodwill are performed.
In addition, negative goodwill at 1 April 2004 has been taken to reserves in compliance with IFRS3.
Under UK GAAP the groups policy was to capitalise goodwill in respect of businesses acquired and amortise it over its estimated useful economic life, which has been assessed as 20 years for recent acquisitions.
Accordingly amortisation charged in the year to 31 March 2005 has been reversed.
d Under UK GAAP, the cost of share options was based on the intrinsic value in the option at the date of grant, meaning that the options granted to employees at market price did not generate an expense.
Under IFRS2, the group measures the costs of all share options granted since November 2002 using fair value models.
As a result, additional expense is recognised in the IFRS income statement.
e In accordance with IFRS, all contracts are accounted for under either IAS11 or IAS18 resulting in a timing difference in profit recognition.
In addition, IAS prohibits netting of payments on account on a more strictly defined basis resulting in a grossing up of the balance sheet under IAS.
f As a result of further more prescriptive guidance in IAS19, holiday pay accruals and prepayments are definitively required.
g Under IAS18 account must be taken of any inbuilt financing within extended payment terms.
Where payment terms are deemed to fall into this category the related debtor is stated at the present value after discounting at prevailing interest rates.
The deemed financing element of the debt is credited to the income statement as interest income as the debt unwinds.
h IAS38 requires that software costs are capitalised as intangible assets.
UK GAAP included such costs in tangible assets.
Accordingly, these assets have now been reclassified as intangible assets.
i Under SSAP17, proposed dividends are accrued for as an adjusting post balance sheet event in the accounting period to which they relate.
Under IAS10, dividends are recognised in the accounting period in which they are declared and paid.
j Under UK GAAP, the groups share of operating profit, interest and tax of equity accounted investments were presented separately.
Under IAS, the groups share of results from equity accounted investments is presented as a single line on the income statement.
As a result of the reclassification, 0.1 million relating to the groups share of tax of equity accounted investments is reclassified from tax under UK GAAP to within profit before tax under IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2005. k Under IAS12, certain temporary differences, in relation to property revaluations not recognised under UK GAAP require recognition, which at acquisition was 0.3 million.
l Certain balance sheet items are disclosed separately within an IFRS balance sheet.
m Under UK GAAP the increase in cash in the year was 14.6 million, which when added to the cash placed on short-term deposit of 5.6 million gives a total of net increase in cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts of 20.2 million, which compares to the IFRS equivalent of 20.1 million.
Included in the change in cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts there are a number of changes reflected in operating profit described above.
These changes, in the main, produce a corresponding adjustment in either working capital or amortisation.

First time adoption of IAS39 at 1 April 2005 The group has adopted the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS32 and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS39 but to apply these from 1 April 2005.
As a result the comparative information is presented on a UK GAAP basis.
The following table shows the impact of adopting IAS32 and IAS39 at 1 April 2005.
