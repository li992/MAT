Goodwill of 11,605,000 arose after fair value adjustments of 2,938,000.
Adjustments from book value to fair value arise principally from the application of Group accounting policies and the recognition of intangible assets under IFRS3 Business Combinations and Fair Value Adjustments to Inventories, Receivables, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Intangible assets relate principally to customer relationships see Note 12.
Fair values relating to the acquisition of B. D. L. Systems Limited are provisional and will be finalised within one year of the acquisition date.
Costs include those legal and accounting costs incurred in developing the acquisition contracts and performing due diligence activities.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of total cost over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the value of synergies and assembled workforces acquired.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues and profits before tax for continuing activities for the year would have been approximately 210 million and 36 million respectively.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of the future results of the combined operations.
