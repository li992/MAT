Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the period ended 30 April 2005, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2006 are the first that the Group has been required to prepare under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Accordingly the Group has prepared financial statements that comply with IFRS applicable for the current accounting period and the significant accounting policies are disclosed on pages 42 to 44.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has restated its opening balance sheet at 25 April 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies required by IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
This note explains the adjustments made by the Group and the Company in restating the UK GAAP balance sheet as at 24 April 2004 and the financial statements for the period ended 30 April 2005.
In accordance with IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group elected not to restate comparative information for the impact of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
These standards have been adopted from 1 May 2005 and the opening balance sheet has been adjusted to reect the adoption of these standards from that date.
Details of these adjustments are set out at the end of this note.

Transition to IFRS continued The adoption of IFRS represented an accounting change only and does not affect the operations or cash ows of the Group.
The effect of the accounting change on the result of the Group is to reduce operating profit and profit before tax for the 53 weeks ended 30 April 2005 by 5.3m and 5.5m respectively.
The accounting policy changes that had the most significant impact on the restated gures are as follows, and are explained in further detail below: The recognition in the income statement of operating lease incentives and capital contributions from landlords over the full life of the lease rather than a shorter period to the first rent review: The recognition of a fair value charge for share-based payments over the three year vesting period of share options: The inclusion on the balance sheet of the net deficit of the dened benefit section of the UK and Ireland pension plans: The timing of the recognition of dividends: Related tax adjustments that increased the effective tax rate for the 53 weeks ended 30 April 2005 from 27.8% to 28.4%.

Transition to IFRS continued Explanation of IFRS adjustments 1 Leases IAS 17 Under UK GAAP, operating lease incentives capital contributions and rent free periods were recognised in the profit and loss account over the period to the first rent review.
In accordance with IAS 17, as interpreted by SIC 15, lease incentives will now be recognised in the income statement over the full term of the lease.
This change is therefore a timing difference that will reverse over the term of each lease.
2 Share-based payments IFRS 2 Under IFRS 2, the charge recognised in the income statement for share options, long-term incentive plans and other share-based payments will be based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant, calculated using an option pricing model.
This contrasts to UK GAAP, where the charge recognised was based on the intrinsic value of awards, being the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of the award and the option exercise price.
The Group has utilised the IFRS 2 exemption in accordance with IFRS 1, and has therefore applied the fair value model to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
For share-based payments, the fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed through the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period usually three years, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the vesting date, an adjustment is made to take into account the actual number of shares that vested.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
3 Pensions IAS 19 HMV Group plc operates dened benefit pension schemes in the UK and Ireland.
Under UK GAAP, the cost to the Group of the dened benefit section of the Group pension scheme was charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The pension provision in the balance sheet represented the differences between contributions paid and cumulative amounts charged to profit: the assets and liabilities of the scheme itself were not recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
IAS 19 requires the operating and nancing costs of dened benefit pensions to be recognised in the income statement, but permits a number of alternative accounting treatments for actuarial gains and losses.
The Group has elected to recognise, directly in equity, all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur.
This option has been selected for consistency, as it is most similar to the treatment required under UK GAAP FRS 17 that has previously been disclosed by way of a note in the Groups financial statements.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet under IAS 19 represents the present value of the dened benefit liabilities under the projected unit credit method, as reduced by the market value of scheme assets.
4 Other adjustments These adjustments are included within the Other column.
4.1 Dividends IAS 10 Dividends will now be recognised only when they are declared and approved, rather than accrued for in the period to which they relate.
Compared to the previous treatment this will have the effect of deferring the recognition of final dividends to the following half-year.
In addition, dividends will be shown as a movement directly in equity instead of through the income statement.
4.2 Deferred taxation IAS 12 IAS 12 takes a balance sheet approach to deferred tax whereby deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet by applying the appropriate tax rate to the temporary differences arising between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
This contrasts with UK GAAP FRS 19, which considers timing differences arising in the income statement.
Adjustments made to the financial statements on the transition to IFRS result in related adjustments to deferred tax, particularly with regard to lease incentives, share-based payments and post-retirement benets.
Furthermore, under IFRS, deferred tax assets and liabilities are always recognised as being non-current.
Previously under UK GAAP, the Group had split its deferred tax balances between those due in less than one year and those due in greater than one year.
Consequently an adjustment has been made to reclassify all deferred tax assets and liabilities to being non-current.
4.3 Cumulative translation differences Under IFRS, exchange differences arising on consolidation on the translation of overseas subsidiaries are required to be recognised as a separate equity reserve.
On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, the cumulative exchange gain or loss associated with that subsidiary is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has utilised the exemption available in IFRS 1 whereby cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS: the profit or loss on all subsequent disposals will therefore exclude any translation differences arising prior to 25 April 2004.
72 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 34.
Transition to IFRS continued Restatement of cash ow statement from UK GAAP to IFRS The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has no effect upon reported cash ows generated by the Group.
The IFRS cash ow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP, with cash ows split into three categories of activity operating, investing and nancing.
The reconciling items between the UK GAAP presentation and the IFRS presentation have no net impact on the cash ows generated.
However the denition of cash differs between UK GAAP and IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, cash comprised cash on hand and deposits on demand.
Under IFRS, cash also includes short-term highly liquid investments, which would have been shown as short-term investments under UK GAAP.
Consequently in the balance sheet at 30 April 2005, balances of 2.9m 2004: 2.0m for the Group have been reclassied from investments and short-term deposits to cash and short-term deposits.
No adjustment was necessary within the Company.
Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 As noted above, the Group adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 May 2005 and as permitted under IFRS 1 have not restated comparative information.
The new accounting policies as applied for the period ended 29 April 2006 are set out on pages 42 to 44.
For accounting periods up to the period ended 30 April 2005, the following accounting policies were applied in respect of financial instruments in the financial statements.
Derivative instruments The Group may from time to time use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, including cross-currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options and interest rate contracts.
A financial derivative is considered to be a hedge by the Group when it alters the risk prole of an existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the risk management policies of the Group.
Interest differentials on derivative instruments are recognised by adjusting net interest payable.
Premiums or discounts arising on derivative instruments are amortised over the life of the instrument.
Forward rate agreements, currency swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the contract rate in respect of their ongoing carrying value in the financial statements and at closing market rates of exchange for market valuation.
The fair value of options is based on market prices at the year end.
The Group generally does not hedge translation exposure of overseas earnings or net assets, although the Group may implement short-term hedges to secure short-term financial objectives.
The underlying asset or liability associated with the financial instrument is valued at the rate implicit in the instrument.
Impact of adoption The impact of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the opening balance sheet at 1 May 2005 was to reduce net equity by 0.7m, as described below: At 1 May 2005 m Other financial assets Recognition of foreign exchange derivatives at fair value 0.4 Other financial liabilities Recognition of foreign exchange derivatives at fair value 1.1 Opening balance sheet adjustment for adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 0.7 Total equity under IFRS as previously stated 14.4 Total equity after adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 15.1 The adjustment within other financial assets and liabilities represents the fair value of forward foreign currency contracts in place at 1 May 2005.
Within the net 0.7m liability, a net 0.1m gain existed on contracts used in order to manage the Groups foreign currency exchange risk arising on purchases of overseas sourced products.
In all cases the implementation of these derivative instruments has been negotiated to match expected purchases and they therefore qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of cash ow hedges in place at 29 April 2006 is nil.
More than offsetting this gain was a net 0.8m liability existing on contracts held as a hedge against the provision of foreign currency loans made to the Groups overseas subsidiaries.
Since the introduction of the global cash pooling system in July 2006, the Group has ceased to make loans that require to be hedged in this way.
Thus there are no such contracts outstanding at 29 April 2006.
