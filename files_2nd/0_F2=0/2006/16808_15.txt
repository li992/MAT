Non-GAAP Information Presentation of Adjusted Operating Profit The Group presents operating profit excluding impairment losses and non-recurring amounts related to business acquisitions and disposals for the Group and the Groups reported business segments, being mobile telecommunications and other operations.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons: these measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis: the presentation by the Groups reported business segments of these measures facilitates comparability with other companies, although the Groups measures may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies: and it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
Reconciliation of these measures to the closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating loss profit, is provided in note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Organic Growth The Group believes that organic growth, which is not intended to be a substitute, or superior to, reported growth, provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons: it provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business: it is used by the Group for internal performance analysis: and it facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies, although the term organic is not a defined term under IFRS, or US GAAP, and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Reconciliation of organic growth to reported growth is shown below: Impact of Organic Impact of foreign acquisitions Reported growth exchange and disposals growth %%%% Mobile telecommunications Voice revenue 5.3 0.6 2.2 8.1 Non-voice revenue Messaging 10.6 0.4 2.1 13.1 Data 60.4 0.4 1.2 61.2 Total service revenue 7.2 0.5 2.2 9.9 Acquisition and retention revenue 2.3 0.8 0.2 2.9 Total revenue 6.7 0.5 2.1 9.3 Interconnect costs 7.2 0.7 2.5 10.4 Group revenue 7.5 0.5 2.0 10.0 Reported Impact of impairment Impact of Impact of growth in losses and non-recurring Reported growth Organic foreign acqusitions in non-GAAP amounts related to business in equivalent 2 growth exchange and disposals measure acquisition and disposals GAAP measure %%%% %% Adjusted operating profit 1 Mobile telecommunications profit 10.3 1.1 11.4 290.2 278.8 1 Total operating profit 11.4 1.0 0.1 12.5 291.3 278.8 Notes: 1 Before impairment losses and non-recurring amounts related to business acquisitions and disposals.
2 Closest equivalent GAAP measure is operating loss profit.
Cash Flow Measures In presenting and discussing the Groups reported results, free cash flow and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with IFRS.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: free cash flow allows the Company and external parties to evaluate the Groups liquidity and the cash generated by the Groups operations.
Free cash flow does not include items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities.
In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which the Group has an obligation to incur.
However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the balance sheet or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although the Groups measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: it is used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes: and it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
The Group believes that the presentation of operating free cash flow is useful and necessary for investors and other interested parties as it provides the quantitative basis for the cash flow targets of the One Vodafone initiatives outlined on pages 18 to 19.
This measure may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities, the closest equivalent GAAP measure, to operating free cash flow and free cash flow, is provided in Performance Financial Position and Resources Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows on page 39.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2006 47 Performance Non-GAAP Information continued Net Debt In presenting and discussing the Groups indebtedness and liquidity position, net debt is calculated.
There is no definition of net debt within IFRS.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to communicate net debt to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: net debt allows the Company and external parties to evaluate the Groups overall indebtedness and liquidity position: net debt facilitates comparability of indebtedness and liquidity with other companies, although the Groups measure of net debt may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: it is used by management for planning and reporting purposes: and it is used in discussions with the investment analyst community and the debt rating agencies.
A reconciliation of short-term and long-term borrowings, the closest equivalent GAAP measures, to net debt is shown on page 41.
Presentation of Other Revenue in Discussion of Trading Results The discussion of the trading results of the Group and principal markets on pages 30 to 37 presents the cost of sales related to acquisition and retention costs, net of revenue attributable to these activities.
The Group believes that this basis of presentation provides useful information for investors for the following reasons: it provides trends in net subsidies with respect to the acquisition and retention of customers: and it facilitates comparability of results with other companies operating in the mobile telecommunications business.
This performance indicator is commonly used in the mobile telecommunications industry and by Vodafone management to compare net subsidies provided to acquire and retain customers to prior periods and internal forecasts.
Net acquisition costs and Net retention costs as used in the trading results are defined on page 49.

Certain of the statements within the section titled Risk Factors, Trends and Outlook on pages 43 to 45, contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
