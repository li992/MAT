We do this by pursuing a long term and disciplined approach to investment for both ICG and our investment clients throughout Europe and lately Asia.
In the first decade of our life as a public company we were able to grow shareholder dividends consistently at more than 10% per annum, fuelled by growth in our core income, net interest income and fee income less expenses.
We intend to do at least as much in this our second decade.
We have consistently achieved superior returns because of the quality and hard work of our team and our strong investment culture.
Unlike a number of other financial institutions, our staff are encouraged to think like owners of the business, with a performance based bonus regime that pays out only after profits on investments are received in cash.
An investor cannot obtain superior profits by simply committing to a specific investment category or style.
He can earn them only be carefully evaluating facts and continuously exercising discipline.
The less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.
