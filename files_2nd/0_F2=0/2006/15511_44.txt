The telent Group has retained all liabilities relating to restructuring programmes announced prior to completion of the disposal of the Telecommunications Equipment and International Services businesses to Ericsson.
The majority of associated outflows are generally expected to occur over the next year with vacant property costs being incurred over the next two years.
The Group announced two major restructuring programmes in the UK during the financial year ended 31 March 2006 as well as programmes in certain overseas territories.
Costs relating to the associated headcount reductions and site closures were the main contributing factors to the 46 million restructuring charge in the year.
Warranties comprise the expected costs of maintenance under guarantees and other work in respect of products delivered, the associated outflows for which are generally expected to occur over the lives of the products.
The majority of the Groups warranty provisions were disposed as part of the sale to Ericsson.
Warranty provisions of 4 million at 31 March 2006 relate mainly to the software support business.
Contracts and commitments comprise mainly losses on contract work in progress in excess of related accumulated costs.
The associated outflows are generally expected to occur over the lives of the contracts, which are long-term in nature.
Litigation and indemnities comprise expected employee related claims, environmental liabilities mainly in North America, other litigation, captive insurance balances and merger and acquisition balances held against warranties provided on the disposal of businesses.
Employee related claims relate mainly to industrial diseases.
The Groups exposure to these claims, which was last assessed by actuaries at 31 March 2005, amounts to 19 million 2005: 18 million after discounting at a rate of 4.5%.
The effect of the unwind of the discount was 1 million for the year ended 31 March 2006.
The Group successfully settled a number of litigations during the financial year for amounts less than the corresponding provisions and recorded a net release of 8 million, which was credited to the income statement.
The litigation outflows are generally expected to occur as and when the relevant litigation is settled and the merger and acquisition outflows are generally expected to occur over the next four years.
Other provisions mainly comprise payroll taxes on share options and other post-retirement agreements.
The release in the period represents the decrease in National Insurance accrued on share options.

On that date, the total number of shares in issue therefore reduced from 214,573,331 to 61,306,666. b Warrants At the time of the Financial Restructuring, the Company issued warrants to holders of shares in M 2003 plc to subscribe for additional ordinary shares of 5p each in the Company.
In total 49.8 million warrants, exercisable up until May 2007, were issued at an exercise price of 1.50 each.
As a result of a subsequent share consolidation, which occurred on 9 September 2003, five warrants must now be exercised per 87.5p ordinary share, giving an aggregate subscription price of 7.50 per share.
The two-for-seven share consolidation on 27 March 2006, referred to above, had no effect on the warrants.
At 31 March 2006, 49.6 million warrants remained outstanding.

Equity shareholders interests continued c Share options The Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration, on pages 24 to 31, contains details of the Senior Management and Employee Plans and the Sharesave Plan.
At 31 March 2006 the following options were outstanding in respect of the Companys ordinary shares: Number of Remaining Number of Remaining shares under contractual shares under contractual option at life option at life 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March Subscription 2006 2006 2005 2005 price millions years millions years per share Exercise period Senior Management Plan Granted 24 June 2003 4.1 7.2 8.5 8.2 Nil May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 1 September 2003 0.3 7.2 0.6 8.2 Nil May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 13 February 2004 0.7 7.9 1.0 8.9 Nil October 2004 to February 2014 Granted 13 February 2004 0.1 7.9 0.1 8.9 Nil May 2004 to February 2014 5.2 10.2 Employee Plan Granted 30 June 2003 1.7 7.2 4.4 8.2 3.08 May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 1 September 2003 7.2 0.2 8.2 4.29 May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 13 February 2004 7.9 8.9 7.17 May 2004 to February 2014 Granted 1 December 2004 0.6 2.4 0.7 3.4 5.72 December 2006 to August 2008 Granted 6 December 2004 0.1 2.4 0.1 3.4 5.67 December 2006 to August 2008 2.4 5.4 Sharesave Plan Granted 3 February 2005 1.1 2.5 1.7 3.5 5.06 April 2005 to September 2008 All options granted under the Senior Management Plan and those granted before December 2004 under the Employee Plan have five performance targets, each having a period in which the options over shares will vest.
The first four performance targets have now been met.
The options granted in December 2004 have a single performance target, which is the same as the fifth performance target relating to the options granted earlier.
The fifth performance target relates to the Groups market capitalisation.
The measurement of this target was amended by ordinary resolution of shareholders, within the rules of the share option plans, to reflect the return of cash to shareholders following the Ericsson transaction and any subsequent return of value together with the timing of such returns.
The cumulative impact on the Groups consolidated income statement over the life of the plans through to the financial year ending 31 March 2007, assuming the final performance target is also met, will be approximately 64 million before payroll taxes.
We expect the charge under IFRS 2, before payroll taxes, to be 3 million in the year to 31 March 2007.
The 64 million charge is a non-cash item.
The two-for-seven share consolidation, described above, had no significant effect upon the option holders as the numbers of shares under option and the exercise prices of those options did not change.
The following tables illustrate the number and weighted average share prices of, and movements in, the share option plans during the year.

Equity shareholders interests continued c Share options continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the share options exercised during the year ended 31 March 2006 was 3.66 2005: 5.79.
During the year, the aggregate gain on share options exercised by the directors amounted to 3,196,800 2005: 13,806,480.
The fair value of options granted under the share option plans has been calculated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice model.
The following tables list the inputs to the model, based on information at the date of grant.

The historic volatility of the Groups share price prior to the Financial Restructuring was not deemed relevant for these grants.
The expected life used in the model has been calculated on the assumption that most tranches of options will be exercised immediately on vesting.
