Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information FirstGroup plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is 395 King Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief Executives review on pages 4 to 15.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
The parent Company financial statements and notes thereto are shown separately under UK GAAP on pages 76 to 83.
2 Significant accounting policies New IFRS Accounting Standards In August 2005 the IASB issued IFRS 7, Financial instruments: disclosures, which the Group will adopt in the financial year commencing 1 April 2007.
The Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specifically the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on the Groups results of operations or financial position.
In August 2005 the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements which the Group will adopt in the financial year commencing 1 April 2006.
The Group will disclose additional information about its objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs are given in note 38.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Minority interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
40 2 Significant accounting policies continued Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger and freight services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services in the UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise agreement receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and Transport Scotland.
Payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the train operating companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
Where season tickets are issued in excess of one weeks duration, the attributable share of income is deferred within creditors and is recognised in the Income Statement over the period covered by the season ticket.
UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts are recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority.
Other Bus and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations are recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
41 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and net foreign borrowings in foreign currencies see below for details of the Groups policies in respect of derivative financial instruments and foreign exchange risks.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising from the average or spot exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging intangible asset amortisation and bid costs but before investment income and borrowing costs.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Various train operating companies in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
The Group is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held.
The full liability is recognised on the balance sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Groups obligations to fund the scheme over the franchise term.
42 2 Significant accounting policies continued Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 15 years straight line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
43 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that, the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments As permitted under IFRS 1, First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has elected not to restate comparative financial information for the financial instruments standards IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The effect of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005 opening balance sheet is disclosed in note 29.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Basis of preparation of 2004 05 information For the year ended 31 March 2005 financial information was prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
An extract from the UK GAAP accounting policy from the 2005 financial statements is set out below: Various derivative instruments are utilised by the Group principally to manage interest rate, fuel and foreign exchange risks.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group, in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps and fuel derivatives are recognised as adjustments to interest expense and fuel costs respectively over the period of the contracts.
Financial Assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories: Fair value through profit and loss This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or Available For Sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i. e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
44 2 Significant accounting policies continued Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short-term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies either up to the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available For Sale financial assets Available For Sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Sterling bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and collars, fuel swaps and collars, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counter-party confirmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
45 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made under IAS 37 for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 503.1m 2005: 465.8m as set out in note 13 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at balance sheet date was 30.0m 2005: 29.4m as set out in note 14.
Defined benefit pension arrangements Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, expected rate of future salary and pension increases along with assumptions about mortality rates.
The most significant of these assumptions is the discount rate.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate applied would impact operating profit and the balance sheet deficit by approximately 1.0m and 30.0m respectively.
The pension liability as at the balance sheet date was 132.0m 2005: 221.1m as set out in note 36.
Self-insurance Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using managements best estimate of the likely settlement of these incidents.
The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as required.
The Groups total insurance reserves as at the balance sheet date was 80.7m 2005: 74.3m as set out in note 27.

During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been valued on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant cashgenerating unit.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent five year plan for the next four years and extrapolates cash flows for the following six years based on estimated growth rates of 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% for North America.
A discount rate of 10.0% was used in arriving at the value in use for each of the cash-generating units.
The calculation of value in use for each cashgenerating unit is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on historic performance of each cash-generating unit and are realistic in light of economic and industry forecasts.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are short-term bank balances and cash, derivative financial instruments and short-term trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its short-term trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was 2.1m 2005: 2.7m.
The credit risk on short-term cash assets and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
19 Non-current assets classified as held for sale Non-current assets held for sale comprise of North American yellow school buses which are surplus to requirement and are being actively marketed on the Internet.
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of such assets are included in arriving at operating profit in the income statement.

Financial risks and management The most material financial risks faced by the Group are the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal treasury policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Group Finance Director.
Foreign currency The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in retranslating net assets and earnings in US Dollars and Canadian Dollars to Sterling for reporting purposes.
The Groups objective is to hedge at a minimum of 30% for US Dollar net assets and 75% for other currencies.
As at 31 March 2006 there was a net investment hedge of 34% of US net assets which were hedged with currency swaps and US Dollar debt.
Retranslation risk on US Dollar earnings are substantially hedged through natural offset by US Dollar denominated costs, principally UK fuel costs and Dollar interest costs.
With the exception of UK fuel, transactional currency exposures are minimal.
Interest rate risk The Group has interest bearing cash and debt and therefore is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates.
The Groups policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility is substantially reduced year on year.
The main floating rate benchmarks are UK LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Group achieves the policy objective through fixed rate debt and cash flow hedge financial instruments, being interest rate swaps and collars.
At 31 March 2006, 85% of net debt was fixed with an average duration of 4.1 years.
It is Board policy to hedge 100% of interest rate risk in operating leases.
Commodity price risk fuel prices The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis in its UK Bus, UK Rail, US and Canadian bus operations and therefore is exposed to changes in diesel prices, of which the most significant element is crude oil price risk.
The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of fixed price protection in the short term, so that the businesses have time to prepare and adjust for prices after the current hedge period expires.
The Group uses a range of cash flow hedge financial instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty, mainly swaps and collars.
During the year to 31 March 2006, the Group hedged 100% of crude price risk in the UK and 64% of crude price risk in the US.
57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Derivative financial instruments continued Credit risk The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of the financial assets as disclosed above, and trade receivables as disclosed in note 18.
Most of trade receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies, principally the UK DfT, Network Rail, Transport for London, UK city councils: School Bus Boards and city councils in North America.
The Group does not consider these counter parties to be a significant risk.
Financial instrument counter parties are subject to pre approval by the Board and it is Board policy to require institutions to have a credit rating of at least A from an international rating agency.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed bank facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
At 31 March 2006, the total amount of committed facilities stood at 527m.
It is Group policy to maintain a minimum of 100m of committed borrowing headroom, to support financial flexibility.
At 31 March 2006, committed borrowing headroom stood at 211m under the Groups 520m syndicated bank facility.
This bank facility expires in March 2010.
The Group has an average debt duration at 31 March 2006 of 7.8 years 2005: 9.0 years, principally provided by its two Sterling bonds, expiring in 2013 and 2019.

No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The performance bonds relate to the North American businesses of 135.7m 2005: 123.9m and the UK Rail franchise operations of 90.2m 2005: 101.2m.
Performance bonds for UK Rail franchise operations increased by 43.7m on 1 April 2006 following the award of two new rail franchises which commenced operation on this date.
The letters of credit relate substantially to insurance arrangements in the UK and North America.
The Company has provided unsecured loan facilities of 103m to First Greater Western Trains Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary that commenced the Greater Western franchise on 1 April 2006, a 46m unsecured loan facility to First Capital Connect Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary that commenced its franchise on 1 April 2006, a 3.2m 2005: 3.2m unsecured loan facility to First Keolis TransPennine Limited, and a 13.6m 2005: 13.6m unsecured loan facility to First ScotRail Limited.
None of these loan facilities were drawn at 31 March 2006.
These facilities represent contingent liabilities of the Company in relation to these subsidiaries, but they do not represent contingent liabilities of the Group.
The Company is party to certain unsecured guarantees granted to banks for overdraft and cash management facilities provided to itself and subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has given certain unsecured guarantees for the liabilities of its subsidiary undertakings arising under certain loan notes, hire purchase contracts, finance leases, operating leases, supply contracts and certain pension scheme arrangements.
It also provides unsecured cross guarantees to certain subsidiary undertakings as required by VAT legislation.
UK Bus subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees on a joint and several basis to the Trustees of the UK Bus Occupational Pension Scheme.
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have issued unsecured guarantees to the Companys Sterling bondholders.
These unsecured guarantees rank pari passu with unsecured guarantees provided by those subsidiaries to lenders participating in the Groups 520m 2005: 520m syndicated unsecured bank facility.

35 Share based payments Equity-settled share option plans a Save as you earn SAYE The Group operates an Inland Revenue approved savings related share option scheme.
Grants were made in December 2002, December 2003 and December 2004.
The scheme is based on eligible employees being granted options and their agreement to opening a sharesave account with a nominated savings carrier and to save weekly or monthly over a specified period.
Sharesave accounts are held with Lloyds TSB.
The right to exercise the option is at the employees discretion at the end of the period previously chosen for a period of six months.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an entitlement vests.
The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it.
Fair values for the SAYE include a 10% p. a. pre-vesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for pre-vesting forfeitures.
The Group used the inputs noted above to measure the fair value of the new share options.
d Buy As You Earn BAYE scheme BAYE enables eligible employees to purchase shares from their gross income.
The Company provides two matching shares for every three shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 per employee per month.
If the shares are held in trust for five years or more, no income tax and national insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
At 31 March 2006 there were 4,576 2005: 4,313 participants in the BAYE scheme who have cumulatively purchased 1,781,489 2005: 1,361,344 shares with the Company contributing 553,009 2005: 438,584 matching shares on a cumulative basis.

The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 2.8m 2005: 4.2m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American employees.
These are principally defined benefit schemes under which benefits provided are based on employees number of years of service and either career average or final salary.
The scope of benefits varies between schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separately administered trusts which are managed independently of the Groups finances by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
The various defined benefit schemes include five UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a scheme operated by a local authority.
These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations.
Great Western Trains Company Limited, First ScotRail Limited, First Great Western Link Limited, GB Rail and TransPennine Express have sections in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, which is an industry-wide arrangement.
Under the terms of the RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared by the employer 60% and the employees 40%.
At their last triennial valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 69.0% and 99.6% 2005: 68.0% and 121.0%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2006 for all defined benefit schemes totalled 1,993m 2005: 1,578m.
Contributions are paid to all defined benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes actuaries.
The valuations are made using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.

Accounting for UK Rail pension arrangements The Group recognises its share of Train Operating Companies deficits that the Group expects to fund over the term of the respective franchises.
This is accounted for by way of a franchise adjustment.

Consequently, 2004 05 comparative information has been restated under IFRS.
Changes to IFRS restatement previously published Our preliminary interpretation of IAS 12 in our IFRS transition document published on the Groups website on 28 September 2005, identified a GAAP difference relating to the recognition of deferred tax and the application of rollover relief.
Current accounting practice does not recognise this GAAP difference.
Accordingly our deferred tax liability at 1 April 2004 is 7.9m lower than previously stated and the deferred tax liability at 31 March 2005 is 8.2m lower than previously published.
In order to make the transition to IFRS easier, IFRS 1 allows some exemptions from full retrospective application of certain standards.
In preparing these financial statements in accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has applied the mandatory exemptions and certain of the optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS.
Business combinations exemption The Group has applied the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1.
It has not restated business combinations that took place prior to the 1 April 2004 transition date.
67 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Explanation of transition to IFRSs continued Cumulative translation differences exemption The Group has elected to set the previously accumulated, cumulative translation differences to zero at 1 April 2004.
This exemption has been applied to all subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 1.
Financial instruments IAS 32 and IAS 39 exemption The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of IAS 32 and IAS 39 in relation to financial instruments until 1 April 2005.
Employee benefits The Group has elected in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benefits, to recognise all actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited to the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments The Group has applied IFRS 2, Share-based payments, to equity-settled awards not vested at 1 April 2005 and granted on or after 7 November 2002.
Estimates exemption Estimates under IFRS at 1 April 2004 are consistent with estimates at the same date under UK GAAP.
The following reconciliations provide a quantification of the effect of the transition to IFRS and details of the impact of the transition on: equity at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005: profit for the year to 31 March 2005.

The Group have reclassified 6.0m of buses held for sale and presented them separately on the face of the balance sheet.
2 The Group has adopted IAS 19, Employee benefits, in respect of all its defined benefit pension schemes.
The balance sheet impact of the implementation of the Standard is to recognise a pension liability of 241.3m in the Groups IFRS balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 in place of the 59.1m SSAP 24 prepayment and a 6.4m creditor previously held under UK GAAP.
In addition there is a reclassification of 4.9m to long-term provisions.
An intangible asset of 4.1m has also been recognised representing the economic benefit derived from the franchise that is attributable to our share of certain rail pension scheme deficits.
The Group has also recognised 89.6m of a deferred tax asset on the pension liability.
3 As required by IAS 10, Events after the balance sheet date, no provision is made within the accounts for the final proposed dividend because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval.
The result is a 31.8m increase in reported net assets.
4 In addition to the deferred tax asset on pension adjustments explained in note 2 above, the Group has also recognised a deferred tax asset of 0.7m with respect to an opening reserves adjustment of 2.4m under IFRS 2, Share-based payments.
5 Under IFRS 1 the Group has taken the option to measure individual items of land and buildings, previously revalued, at cost.
This has resulted in a 3.4m reclassification from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings.
6 Retained earnings impact of all IFRS adjustments, principally the IAS 19 adjustments less the deferred tax asset recognised on these adjustments.

The net realisable value of buses held for sale at 31 March 2005 was 5.2m.
2 IAS 36, Impairment of assets, no longer permits the amortisation of goodwill.
Instead goodwill is carried at cost and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
The Group has chosen under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date.
Accordingly all prior business combination accounting is frozen at the transition date and the value of goodwill is frozen at 1 April 2004 and goodwill amortisation previously reported under UK GAAP for 2004 05 is reversed for the Groups IFRS statements.
The impact of IAS 36 has been that the goodwill amortisation charge of 25.8m has been reversed.
Under IFRS 3, the goodwill additions of 25.8m have been split between other contract intangibles of 10.6m and 15.2m of goodwill.
There is an amortisation charge of 0.6m on the contracts intangible.
A deferred tax liability of 7.9m has been recognised due to the reversal of goodwill amortisation and the subsequent amortisation charge on contract intangibles.
70 38 Explanation of transition to IFRSs continued 3 The Group has adopted IAS 19, Employee Benefits, in respect of its defined benefit pension schemes.
The Balance Sheet impact of the implementation of this Standard is to recognise a pension liability of 221.1m in the Groups IFRS balance sheet at 31 March 2005 in place of a 69.1m SSAP prepayment and 5.7m creditor previously held under UK GAAP.
In addition there is a reclassification of 4.4m to long-term provisions.
An intangible asset of 19.4m has also been recognised representing the economic benefit derived from the franchise agreements that is attributable to our share of certain rail pension deficits.
The Group has also recognised a deferred tax asset of 81.9m on these pension adjustments.
4 As required by IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, no provision is made within the accounts for the final proposed dividend because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval.
The result is a 34.1m increase in reported net assets.
5 In addition to the deferred tax liability on goodwill explained in note 2 above and the deferred tax asset on pension adjustments explained in note 3 above, the Group has also recognised a deferred tax asset of 2.5m under IFRS 2, Share-based payments.
6 Under IFRS 1 the Group has taken the option to measure individual items of land and buildings, previously revalued, at cost.
At 31 March 2005 this resulted in a 1.8m reclassification from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings.
7 As at 31 March 2005 14.2m has been reclassified to hedging and translation reserves from retained earnings.
8 Retained earnings impact of all IFRS adjustments, principally the IAS 19 pension adjustments less the deferred tax asset recognised on these adjustments.
Reconciliation of profit for the year to 31 March 2005 Effect of transition UK GAAP to IFRSs IFRSs Notes m m m Revenue 2,693.4 2,693.4 Operating expenses 1 2,481.8 3.2 2,478.6 Operating profit 211.6 3.2 214.8 Amortisation charges 2 25.8 23.6 2.2 Bid costs 11.9 11.9 Profit on disposal of fixed assets 3.3 3.3 Finance income 4.3 4.3 Finance costs 52.6 52.6 Profit before tax 128.9 26.8 155.7 Tax expense 3 32.7 8.4 41.1 Net profit 96.2 18.4 114.6 Notes to the reconciliation of the income statement for 2005 1 The Group has adopted IAS 19, Employee Benefits, in respect of all defined benefit pension schemes.
This has resulted in a 6.1m credit to the income statement as the pension charge under IAS 19 is lower than that previously charged under SSAP 24.
As required by IFRS 2, Share-based Payments, an income statement charge of 2.9m has been made based on the fair value of the outstanding share options granted since 7 November 2002.
2 IAS 36 no longer permits the amortisation of goodwill and therefore 25.8m of a goodwill amortisation charge under UK GAAP has been reversed.
Intangible asset amortisation charges of 1.6m and 0.6m have been provided on the rail franchise intangible and contract intangibles respectively.

The cash flow statement under IFRS is similar to the format under UK GAAP but presents certain cash flows in different categories and in a different order than under UK GAAP.
All of the IFRS transitional adjustments net out within net cash from operating activities.
