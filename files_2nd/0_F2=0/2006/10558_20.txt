Accounting policies The accounting policies are set out below together with an indication of the effects of their adoption.
FRS 28 Corresponding Amounts has had no material effect as it imposes the same requirements for comparatives as hitherto required by the Companies Act 1985.
The corresponding amounts in these financial statements are, other than those covered by the exception permitted by FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, restated in accordance with the new policies.
FRS 25 permits the corresponding amounts not to be restated and the Company has adopted this approach.
The financial instruments policy set out below provides further details of the current year and comparative year basis.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and under the historical costs accounting rules.
Under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the cash flows of the Company are included within the published consolidated financial statement.
Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 50 years Motor vehicles 3 years Fixtures 1020 years Computer software 35 years Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Post retirement benefits The Company participates in a Group wide pension scheme providing benefits based on career average pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Refer to note 42 for the additional disclosures required by FRS 17.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company Following the adoption of FRS 25, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity i. e. forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a They include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
90 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Notes to the financial statements 30.
Accounting policies continued Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company continued Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders funds see dividends policy, are dealt with as appropriations in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Hedging instruments and hedged items are accounted for separately in the balance sheet.
Gains and losses on both are included in profit for the year when they arise fair value hedges or when the hedged transaction occurs having first recorded those on the hedging instrument in equity cash flow hedges, to the extent effective.
Certain financial assets and liabilities have been designated as fair value through profit or loss and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of such instruments during the year were recognised immediately in the income statement.
Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchase of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
Share-based payments The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 and those not yet vested as at 5 January 2005 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Staff numbers and costs The average number of persons employed by the Company including Directors during the year, analysed by category, was as follows: Number of employees 2006 2005 Directors and head office staff 25 29 Global business units staff 13 13 38 42 The aggregate payroll costs of these persons were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Wages and salaries 7.0 7.3 Share-based payments see note 21 3.2 2.5 Social security costs 0.6 2.0 Other pension costs 1.2 2.1 Total overhead employee cost 12.0 13.9 32.
