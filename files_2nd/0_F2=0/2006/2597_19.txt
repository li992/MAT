NOTES CONTINUED 10 Intangible assets continued Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs.
Each CGU represents a business acquired by the Group.
At 31 December 2006 only one CGU, Groupe Pierre Le Goff GPLG, carried a significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Groups goodwill.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of GPLG at 31 December 2006 was 94.6m 2005: 94.9m.
At 31 December 2006 the aggregate amount attributable to the Groups CGUs excluding GPLG was 403.2m 2005: 326.2m.
Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts.
The Groups methodology is to assess the recoverable amount by calculating value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted.
The Groups methodology is to use a projection period of five years.
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect managements expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period.
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, future margins, any significant changes to the customer base and the discount rate used in the present value calculation.
The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost base.
This provides a long term growth rate consistent with past experience within the geographic segments in which the Group operates, together with managements assessment of future operating performance and market share movements.
Growth rates used were either 2.5% or 2.6%.
A discount rate of 7.7% has been applied to the value in use calculations representing a pre tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date.
The key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent is the underlying customer base.
Based on past experience management considers that it is reasonable to assume that there will not be a major deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact the future cash flows.
Should such a change occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant CGU.
Any such changes are monitored through normal monthly procedures.
