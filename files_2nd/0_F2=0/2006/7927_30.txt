A number of countries around the world including Ireland, Italy, Norway and New Zealand already have comprehensive bans in place and others are likely to follow in the future.
Our View Imperial Tobacco recognises that other peoples tobacco smoke can be unpleasant or annoying and can raise concerns leading to calls to ban smoking in the workplace.
However, it is our view that the scientific evidence, taken as a We have a long history of whole, is insufficient to establish that other peoples tobacco smoke is a cause of any co-operation with authorities in disease.
We believe that concerns about the markets in which we operate smoking in public places can be resolved through common sense and courtesy and and we remain committed to by introducing practical solutions such as well-ventilated smoking and no-smoking working constructively with areas into workplaces, restaurants, bars governments and regulatory and other public places.
We believe that sound, reasonable and practical regulation combined with well thought out voluntary agreements is the most effective way forward.

 LLP Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors Bristol 31 October 2006 Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Summary Statutory Reports Summary Corporate Governance Report The Board of Directors the Board remains committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance, which it sees as a cornerstone in managing the business affairs of the Group and a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities.
Throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report the Group has complied with the governance rules and best practice provisions applying to UK listed companies as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code.
Since Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange 41 Commission SEC, the Group also complies with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which are applicable to foreign large accelerated filers.
In the light of this ongoing obligation, a programme of activity was put in place to enable the Group to meet the further requirements with regard to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which are applicable for the first time in respect of the financial year ended 30 September 2006.
Corporate Governance Compliance The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for the Groups standard of governance and seeks to maintain high standards in the management of the affairs of the Group.
Accordingly both the Board and the Audit Committee have continued to keep under review the Groups entire system of internal control, encompassing both financial and operational controls, as well as compliance and risk management.
Based on these reviews the Board is satisfied that an appropriate internal control framework is in place across the whole Group.
As previously reported, certain investigations were initiated by German authorities in January 2003 into alleged foreign trading and related violations by a number of people, including Reemtsma employees during a period prior to its acquisition by the Group.
A number of former and current employees have been interviewed and the German authorities have sought assistance from several other jurisdictions to obtain evidence.
These investigations are continuing but in the course of 2005 parts of the investigations into certain of the individuals were terminated on terms agreed by the individuals with the authorities and settlement was made of any duty payable as a result of certain of the activities being investigated at no cost to the Group.
In 2006, investigations against some of the other individuals were terminated for lack of evidence.
Charges relating to smuggling have been brought in connection with one of the investigations against 18 individuals, one of whom is a former Reemtsma employee.
The continuing investigations and ensuing trials could take several years to be concluded.
If employees are ultimately found to have committed offences, the authorities could impose penalties on Reemtsma for which the Group would seek recovery under arrangements made on the acquisition of the business.
A Board Committee, established in 2003, under the Chairmanship of Mr A G L Alexander, remains in place to monitor the progress of the investigations and the Groups responses on behalf of the Board.
The German authorities investigations are based on alleged activities prior to the Groups acquisition of Reemtsma and the Committee remains satisfied that, since the acquisition, the Group has not been involved in any activities of a nature similar to those alleged by the German authorities.
As previously reported, information was supplied by Imperial Tobacco and a number of other companies to the UK Office of Fair Trading the OFT in October 2003 in relation to an enquiry into the operations of the UK tobacco supply chain.
Further information was supplied in April 2005 but to date no substantive response to any of the information submitted has been received from the OFT.
If the OFT were to decide that there are grounds for an infringement decision against the Group, it would issue a Statement of Objections setting out its preliminary findings and the basis for those findings.
Imperial Tobacco would then have an opportunity to respond to these preliminary findings.
If the OFT were subsequently to make an infringement finding, Imperial Tobacco would be able to appeal the OFTs infringement decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
As at 27 October 2006, the OFT has not issued a Statement of Objections or publicly announced an intention to do so and as such the Board is unable to predict the outcome of this enquiry.
However, in the event that the OFT decides that a company has infringed UK competition law, it may impose a fine.
The amount of the fine is calculated by reference to the turnover of the infringing company.
The rules regarding the maximum amount of such a penalty changed on 1 May 2004.
Before that date, the maximum amount of a fine was 10 per cent of a companys UK turnover for up to three years.
In the three years to 30 September 2003 our aggregate net UK turnover was 2,215 million.
Under the revised rules, a fine may not exceed 10 per cent of a companys worldwide turnover.
However, the OFTs guidelines state that where an infringement ended before 1 May 2004, the fine may not exceed the maximum penalty under the old rules.
In either case, the applicable turnover on which the amount of a fine is based expressly excludes VAT and other taxes directly related to turnover, which we have been advised would also exclude duty.
In addition, if the OFT were to make an infringement finding, it could issue orders prohibiting that activity in the future.
Board and Board Committees The Board of Directors, which met seven times during the year with two of the meetings having a duration of two days, currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, six independent Non-Executive Directors, one Non-Executive Director not classified, for the purposes of the Code, as independent when determining the composition of the Board or its Committees and five Executive Directors.
There is a clear separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority.

Dr K M Burnett and Mr C F Knott joined the Board on 19 April 2006 as Non-Executive Directors, having been identified as suitable candidates for appointment by an external search consultancy.

In addition Mr I J G Napier, as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, met with the Non-Executive Directors as a group, without the Chairman present, to consider the performance of the Chairman.
The Chairman additionally held meetings exclusively with the Non-Executive Directors to consider the performance of the Executive Directors.

Messrs A G L Alexander and S P Duffy stepped down from 31 January 2006.
Messrs C R Day, Mr C F Knott and I J G Napier are qualified accountants and are therefore appropriately qualified to discharge the responsibilities that Audit Committee membership entails and are regarded as financial experts for the purposes of both the Code and section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The Committees terms of reference cover the matters recommended by the Code.
Its duties included monitoring internal control throughout the Group, approving the Group's accounting policies, reviewing the interim and annual financial statements together with the US filing on Form 20-F, prior to submission to the Board, reviewing the scope of the external Audit plan and the internal Group Compliance work plan, consideration of any related party matters, review of Auditor independence, consideration of and recommendations to the Board regarding the reappointment of the Auditors, review of non audit fees paid to the Auditors, review of the Going Concern statement prior to consideration by the Board, oversight and monitoring of the Groups Public Interest Disclosure Whistleblowing policy and review of risk management systems.

The Finance Director, other financial management and the Head of Group Compliance attend each meeting of the Committee by invitation.
The Group's Auditors also attend each meeting.
Standing items on each agenda allow for the Head of Group Compliance and the Auditors to meet formally with the Committee without any Executive Director or other manager being present.
The Group has maintained and regularly reviews its Auditor Independence Policy document, which provides clear definitions of services that the external Auditors can and cannot provide such that their independence and objectivity are not impaired.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Summary Statutory Reports Internal control The Board acknowledges responsibility for the Group's system of internal control.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews the effectiveness of the system in accordance with the guidance set out in Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code the Turnbull guidance from information and regular reports provided by management, the internally independent Group Compliance Function and external Auditors.
However, given the size and complexity of the Groups operations, such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of meeting internal control objectives by managing rather than eliminating risk 43 and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board, either directly or through the Audit Committee which reports its findings for consideration by the Board, regularly reviews the effectiveness of the key procedures which have been established to provide internal control and confirms that an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Groups significant risks operated throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
The following key features have operated to provide reassurance of both the reliability of information and the safeguarding of assets: Risk assessment A detailed assessment of strategic risks is undertaken by the Executive Directors as part of the medium-term planning and annual and monthly forecasting reporting cycles.
The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for considering Group-wide operational, financial and compliance risks on a regular basis.
All areas of the business are required to undertake risk-profiling exercises to formally review their principal areas of risk so that all major risks are reviewed at all levels across the Group.
This formal system is based on the annual submission of risk assessment summaries from each of the business operations identifying their major areas of business risk together with the controls embedded in the business processes to mitigate such risks.
Control environment and control activities The Group is organised on a functional basis with manufacturing, sales and marketing and central support functions each having their own management and control structures which satisfy the Group's controls, accounting policies and regulatory responsibilities.
Clearly defined lines of responsibility with appropriate delegations of authority and segregation of duties exist, with personnel of the necessary calibre in place to fulfil their roles.
The Board has formally adopted, and annually reviews, a schedule of matters of a strategic, financial, operational and compliance nature, which are required to be brought to it for decision and has established a framework of policies and procedures to which personnel are expected to comply.
A formal policy and arrangements for dealing in confidence with issues of genuine and significant concern raised by employees or others relating to perceived malpractice, improper business practices, management impropriety or other similar matters, whether financial or non-financial commonly referred to as Whistleblowing arrangements operates throughout the Group.
Information and communication Each area of the business is required to produce detailed financial plans, prior to the start of each financial year, which are reviewed for robustness and realism.
Major variances against these plans are promptly and thoroughly investigated and the achievement of business objectives, both financial and non-financial, is also assessed on a regular basis.
Monitoring A range of procedures is used to review the risk profile and monitor the effective application of internal controls across the Group.
These include independent reviews by the Group Compliance Function, together with self-assessment of risks and relevant controls.
Furthermore both the senior operational and financial managers of each business and function annually certify that effective systems of internal control, in accordance with the Groups policies and covering all business activities both financial and non-financial, have been maintained within their area of responsibility.
The Audit Committee confirms it has reviewed and reported to the Board on the system of internal control for the financial year ended 30 September 2006 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
This was achieved through the procedural and reporting framework for monitoring business risks and controls, as outlined out above, and review of the Groups financial statements.
In line with recommendations issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and to meet corporate governance best practice in the UK, the Group has a Disclosure Committee comprising appropriate senior executives to assist the Chief Executive, Finance Director and, as appropriate, the Audit Committee, in their evaluation of material issues for the purposes of any disclosure that may be required.
Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group and Company has adequate resources to meet its operational needs for the foreseeable future and accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
com Summary Statutory Reports Summary Corporate Governance Report continued Pension fund The Groups main pension fund, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, is not controlled by the Board but by Trustees, consisting of five nominees from the Company, one member chosen by employees and two by current and deferred pensioners.
The Trustees look after the assets of the pension fund, which are held separately from those of the Group and are managed by independent fund managers.
The pension fund assets can only be used in accordance with its rules and for no other purpose.
44 New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements As a listed non-US issuer, the Group is required to comply with some of the New York Stock Exchanges NYSE listing standards relating to the corporate governance practices of listed companies, being exempt from others.
However, there is an obligation to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies under the NYSE listing standards.
At this time, the Group believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with the relevant NYSE listing standards.
However, in respect of the NYSE standards relating to the composition of a Nomination Corporate Governance Committee, it was the Groups practice to include the Chief Executive, in addition to all of the NonExecutive Directors, on the Nominations Committee.
However, he stepped down from the Committee with effect from the 2006 AGM.
Furthermore it is the Board, not the Nominations Committee, which develops, recommends and adopts the corporate governance principles to be applied throughout the Group.
It should also be noted that the role of an internal audit department is incorporated within the general remit of the internally independent Group Compliance Function.
Communication with shareholders Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority and a number of methods are used to promote greater understanding and dialogue with investment audiences.
All material documents including the Annual Report and Form 20-F together with announcements, investor presentations and share price information are available online through the Imperial Tobacco web-site www.

 LLP, the Groups Auditors, certify Earnings Per Share EPS calculations used in the Groups share plans prior to awards vesting.
Responsibilities The Board is ultimately responsible for the framework and cost of executive remuneration but has delegated to the Remuneration Committee, within its terms of reference, responsibility for the following activities: determination of the remuneration levels and conditions of service for Executive Directors, Chairman and members of the Chief Executives Committee: oversight of the overall policy for senior management remuneration: oversight of the Groups employee share or cash-based incentive plans including approval of minor rule amendments, invitations and awards and the allocation or issue of shares or payments under any such plans: and approval of the form and content of the Directors Remuneration Report, prior to submission to the shareholders at the AGM.
com Summary Statutory Reports Directors Remuneration Report continued During the year the most significant issues addressed by the Committee were: amendments to the share plan rules to take account of the Age Discrimination Act: review of executive pension arrangements following the recent pension reforms in the UK: annual review of the operation, performance conditions, vesting schedules, comparator groups and grant levels of awards under the Groups share plans, to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of the Groups current performance and prospects and aligned 46 with the strategy and objectives of the Group: determination of bonus performance criteria and review of performance against the selected criteria prior to bonus payment: and oversight of the negotiations administration of the agreed settlement with Mr B C Davidson.
The Committees approach is fully consistent with the Groups overall remuneration strategy and philosophy that all employees should be competitively rewarded to attract and retain their valued skills in the business, as well as supporting corporate strategy, by directly aligning executive management reward with the Groups strategic business goals.
Remuneration strategy Imperial Tobacco Group PLC operates in a highly competitive, international environment.
For the Group to continue to compete successfully it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objectives of attracting, developing, retaining and motivating the necessary high quality pool of talented employees at all levels across the Group.
The Group therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in the countries in which it operates.
The Remuneration Committee maintains an overview of the remuneration policy for all employees, including arrangements for progression and succession planning.
The Groups remuneration arrangements not only align with the Groups fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity but also support the Groups corporate strategy, a significant contributor to its competitive advantage.
The Group continues to relocate employees internationally to facilitate their development, and thus the Companys pool of talent, and to achieve the optimum balance of experience within each of the Groups subsidiaries.
A cohesive reward structure across the Group is critical in ensuring that all employees can associate with, and strive for, the Groups strategic goals.
During the year this structure was consistently applied to all employees and communicated to ensure each element of the package is understood and the links to corporate performance recognised.
To assist in this communication senior employees were issued with total reward statements.
The Group strives to align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving employees the opportunity and encouragement to build a shareholding in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
Through a series of employee share plans the majority of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries have been offered participation in one or more equity-based plans with in excess of 42 per cent of the eligible population participating in one or more of those plans.
Executive remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executives Committee.
The package is designed to attract and retain high quality executives, induce loyalty and motivate them to achieve a high level of corporate performance in line with the best interests of shareholders, while not being excessive.
The executive remuneration policy is set to provide base salary at around the median level of the comparator group, as set out below, while providing the Executive Directors and Chief Executives Committee members with the capacity to earn upper quartile total compensation on achievement of superior business performance.
The executive remuneration policy combines short term and long term rewards focusing on, and significantly weighted towards, performance-related elements that take into account individual, functional and corporate performance.
The main components are base salary, annual cash bonus, share matching scheme SMS, long term incentive plan LTIP and pension benefits.
In the financial year to 30 September 2006, base salary typically represented around 28 per cent of total remuneration for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and around 37 per cent of total remuneration for the other Executive Directors with annual bonus and awards vesting under SMS and LTIP making up the balance.

The comparator group of companies chosen remains the FTSE 50 excluding companies in the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors.
Base salary is the only element of the package used to determine pensionable earnings.
Annual cash bonus For the financial year ended 30 September 2006 the potential maximum bonus was 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 75 per cent for other Executive Directors.
For all Executive Directors potential bonus, to a level representing 2 66 per cent of base salary, related to achievement of performance criteria based on Group adjusted profit before tax, set at the 3 beginning of the financial year.
The attainment of bonus in excess of this level was subject to achievement of additional stretching and incremental performance criteria relating to Group adjusted profit before tax, sales volume growth and gross margins.
The specific targets are not, however, disclosed as they are considered to be commercially confidential.
com Summary Statutory Reports Directors Remuneration Report continued Performance in the financial year has resulted in bonuses, as detailed in the table on page 49, being awarded to Executive Directors.
These payments represented 58.0 per cent of base salary in respect of the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 58.0 per cent in respect of the other Executive Directors.
Cash bonuses were also earned by other senior management for achieving relevant performance targets for the financial year to 30 September 2006.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2007 the Remuneration Committee has determined that the potential maximum bonus 48 remains 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 75 per cent for other Executive Directors.
The performance criterion will, however, be changed to being based on adjusted Earnings Per Share growth as, given the Groups current share buyback programme, adjusted Earnings Per Share reflects both the cost and benefit of the buyback programme, encouraging share buyback efficiency and further aligning Executives interests with those of shareholders.
No element of the bonus is guaranteed.
The Executive Directors may elect to invest up to the maximum of their gross bonus in the SMS as detailed on page 54.

Over a period of five years from appointment they are required to build a holding in the Groups shares to a current minimum value broadly equivalent to three times base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and twice base salary in respect of the other Executive Directors.
Other senior management are expected to invest at a level equivalent to between once and twice base salary, dependent upon grade.
Failure to meet the minimum shareholding is taken into account when determining eligibility for future LTIP awards.
All Executive Directors currently exceed their required shareholding.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Annual awards are made under the LTIP to Executive Directors and other senior management.
These awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three year performance period.
All grants are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive any such grant.
Awards granted prior to November 2005 were equivalent to 75 per cent of basic salary for all Executive Directors and at a lower level for other senior management.
Following a comprehensive remuneration review in 2004 and subsequent shareholder approval at the 2005 AGM, awards made in November 2005 were equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, 150 per cent for the Finance Director and 100 per cent for the other Executive Directors with awards at a lower level for other senior management.
Current structure The performance criteria for the November 2005 and proposed future awards are split into three elements as follows: First element 50 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on average growth in basic Earnings Per Share adjusted for certain items based on an agreed protocol, such as significant costs of restructuring EPS.
The adjustments are confirmed by the Auditors after adjusting for inflation over the period of the award.
12.5 per cent of this element i. e. 6.25 per cent of the total award vests if average annual EPS growth, after adjusting for UK inflation Real Annual EPS Growth, equals three per cent and 100 per cent of this element i. e. 50 per cent of the total award vests if Real Annual EPS Growth equals or exceeds 10 per cent.
Between these two points this element vests on a straight-line basis.
Second element 25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to the FTSE 100 Index as described below.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Summary Statutory Reports The performance criterion for this element is based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR ranks it in the top 50 of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index.
At this performance threshold 30 per cent of this element i. e. 7.5 per cent of the total award vests.
If the return ranks the Company in the top 25 of the Index, this element i. e. 25 per cent of the total award vests in full.
Between these thresholds this element vests on a straight-line basis.
51 Third element 25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group as described below.
The performance criterion for this element is also based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies constituting the comparator group comprising 12 tobacco and alcohol companies as detailed below.
At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of this element i. e. 7.5 per cent of the total award vests.
If the return ranks the Company in the top three of the comparator group, this element i. e. 25 per cent of the total award vests in full.
Altadis S A Altria Group Inc British American Tobacco PLC Carlsberg A S Diageo PLC Gallaher Group PLC Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Interbrew SA Pernod Ricard SA Reynolds American Inc SABMiller PLC Scottish & Newcastle PLC If one of the comparator group companies is acquired prior to the granting of an award a suitable replacement will be made.
For any corporate actions affecting a comparator group company during an award period the intention would be to mirror the actions of a passive investor, e. g. for an equity bid the new shares offered in exchange for the original company would be held for the remainder of the award period.
The TSR calculations use share prices averaged over a period of three months to determine the initial and closing prices rather than those ruling on a single day.
It is assumed that the cash flow of dividend payments is recognised on the date the shares are declared ex dividend.
This method is considered to give a fairer and less volatile result as improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR calculations.
All share prices and dividend flows are converted to sterling on the applicable date to ensure that the calculations reflect the return achievable by a UK based investor.
The TSR calculations themselves are performed independently by Alithos Limited.
Each element operates independently and is capable of vesting regardless of the Companys performance in respect of the other elements.
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance criteria, award policy, comparator groups and vesting schedules for LTIP awards and decided that the three elements remain the most important measures that drive and measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value.
The TSR criteria reflect comparative performance against the appropriate FTSE sector and the bespoke comparator group of companies.
The EPS criterion reflects a key part of the Groups strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Awards outstanding under the historic structure For awards granted between December 2000 and November 2004, EPS growth was the sole performance criterion.
This was seen as focusing on the financial performance of the business, over which Directors and senior management could exercise influence.
These awards vest on a sliding scale depending on average growth in basic Earnings Per Share adjusted under the terms of the protocol described above.
The EPS calculations are confirmed by the Auditors.
No vesting occurs unless the Companys Real Annual EPS Growth exceeds three per cent.
Full vesting occurs if Real Annual EPS Growth is equal to or exceeds 10 per cent.
Between these two points the award vests on a straight-line basis.
In respect of the award which vested in November 2005, no vesting occurred unless Real Annual EPS Growth was positive and full vesting occurred if Real Annual EPS Growth was equal to or exceeded 10 per cent.
Vesting of awards On vesting a participant is granted a nil cost option to acquire the relevant number of shares.
The option may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
There is no opportunity to re-test if any of the performance criteria are not achieved.
The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to vary, but not increase, the extent to which any awards vest to ensure they only vest, and at an appropriate level, if there has been an improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company, including the maintenance of long term return on capital employed.
Under the LTIP Rules, in the event that Imperial Tobacco Group PLC is acquired, the relevant performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
There have been no changes in any Directors awards since 30 September 2006.
During the year, the November 2002 November 2005 award vested in full.
Real Annual EPS Growth over the period averaged 19.20 per cent, exceeding the average 10 per cent threshold at which the award maximised.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Summary Statutory Reports In respect of the November 2003 November 2006 award, based on EPS to the end of the financial year, 100 per cent of the award will vest on 18 November 2006.
For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 27 October 2006, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, was 18.54 valuing the awards as follows: Award vesting Award vesting Award lapsing No.

The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2004 November 2007 and the November 2005 November 2008 awards to be too distant from maturity to be included in the value projected above.
However, in respect of the 2004 2007 award, the adjusted Real Average EPS Growth was 8.7 per cent in the performance period to the end of September 2006 and, therefore, if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance period, there would be partial vesting of 77.1 per cent of the award.
In respect of the 2005 2008 award, the first with the three part performance criteria, based upon interim measurement calculations prepared as at 30 September 2006 partial vesting of 38.6 per cent of the first element would occur if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance period.
The second and third elements will lapse if the current performance is maintained over the relevant performance period.

com Summary Statutory Reports Directors Remuneration Report continued Share Matching Scheme SMS Annual scheme Under the SMS the Remuneration Committee at its absolute discretion invites Executive Directors and the majority of the Groups management to invest any proportion of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares to be held by a nominee managed by the Employee Benefit Trust.
Provided that the shares lodged are left with the nominee for three years and the participant remains an employee in the Group, they will be matched on a one for one basis.
54 However, in respect of investments made by Executive Directors under the SMS from their bonus paid in December 2003 and for future years, a performance criterion will be applied to the matched shares such that matching will only occur if the Group has achieved Real Average EPS Growth in excess of three per cent after adjusting for UK inflation over the three year retention period, being an indicator of sustained ongoing profit delivery.
Achievement measurement is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP.
There is no opportunity to re-test if this performance criterion is not met.
In setting the performance criterion for SMS awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that EPS reflects a key part of the Groups strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Under the scheme Rules, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criterion.
Centenary scheme To encourage employees to acquire and retain a shareholding, and to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited, all employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trust or its nominee.
Provided these shares are left with the Trust and the participant remains an employee in the Group, the shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20 per cent for one years retention to a maximum of 100 per cent if they are retained for the full five years to 12 August 2007.
There have been no changes in any Directors contingent rights since 30 September 2006.
During January 2006, annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2002 and lodged under the SMS for a three-year period matured, providing matched shares for participants on a 1:1 basis.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2005 and paid in December 2005, the Executive Directors elected, in February 2006, to invest their entire bonus in the form of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares under the SMS.
These will be matched on a 1:1 basis provided they are left in the SMS for three years, the participant remains an employee in the Group and the Company has achieved in excess of 3 per cent Real Annual EPS Growth over the retention period.
This performance criterion and the award policy and vesting schedules were reviewed by the Committee during the year and deemed to remain appropriate.
These matching shares are shown within Contingent rights arising above.
It is anticipated that, in February 2007, the Executive Directors will again invest their entire bonus earned in the financial year to 30 September 2006 in the form of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares under the SMS.
Impact of IFRS on LTIP and SMS The financial year ending 30 September 2006 is the first where the Company is required to account under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
All performance criteria have been adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.
com Summary Statutory Reports Directors Remuneration Report continued Share options The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme.
However, Executive Directors are eligible along with all employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group where possible to participate in Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs savingsrelated Sharesave Plan.
Under this Plan options are granted, at a discount of up to 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation, to participants who have contracted to save up to 250 per month over a period of three or five years.
Or date of appointment to the Board if later.
Any option not exercised by the end of the range of exercisable dates will expire.
Gains made on exercise, calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the date of exercise.
Aggregate gains during the year were 6,203 2005: nil.
There have been no changes in any Directors share options since 30 September 2006.
The Companys middle market share price at the close of business on 29 September 2006, being the last trading day of the financial year, was 17.80 and the range of the middle market price during the year was 15.47 to 18.43.
Full details of the Directors share interests are available for inspection in the Register of Directors Interests at the Companys registered office.
Award Dates It is the Groups policy to grant awards under all its employee share plans on predetermined dates based on an annual cycle.
Employee Benefit Trusts The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust the Executive Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust the 2001 Trust have been established to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the SMS and LTIP awards.
As potential beneficiaries of the Executive Trust, each of the Executive Directors is deemed to have a contingent interest in the 905,542 Ordinary Shares of the Company held by that Trust at 30 September 2006.
Details of the shareholdings by the Employee Benefit Trusts are as follows: Shares under Balance at Purchased Distributed Balance at Award at Surplus 1 10 2005 during year during year 30 9 2006 30 9 2006 Shortfall Executive Trust 929,837 259,735 284,030 905,542 886,994 18,548 2001 Trust 2,096,700 3,102,009 1,857,908 3,340,801 4,711,099 1,370,298 As at 30 September 2006, the Company also held 46,004,000 shares in Treasury which may be used to satisfy awards under the share plans.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Summary Statutory Reports Share plan flow rates The Companys policy has always been to satisfy all awards under its share plans from market purchased shares through the Trusts.
The Trust Deeds and the Rules of all plans contain provisions limiting awards to five per cent in five years and 10 per cent in 10 years for all employee share plans with an additional restriction to five per cent in 10 years for executive plans.
Currently an aggregate total of only 0.8 per cent of the Companys issued share capital is subject to awards under all the Groups executive and all employee share plans.
In future the Trust may also be provided with shares held by the Company in Treasury in order to satisfy vesting awards.
57 Since demerger in 1996 the cumulative awards under all of the Companys share plans totals under 3 per cent of its issued share capital.
Following initial grants on demerger, subsequent annual grants have averaged 0.3 per cent of issued share capital.
Summary of current awards outstanding: Limit on awards Current awards % Increase in awards during year % 10% in 10 years 2.9 0.3 5% in 5 years 1.4 0.3 5% in 10 years executive schemes 1.4 0.1 Executive Directors pensions Post 6 April 2006 A day the Groups UK pension policy, which applies to all current Executive Directors, provides the option to maintain membership of or join new employees the UK Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund or receive a salary supplement in lieu of membership of the Fund.
The Executive Directors are all members of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group.
For members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the fund is non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60.
The fund allows members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age after 32 years service.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted.
For death before retirement a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members expected pension at retirement.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependent children will also receive allowances.
Pensions increase annually by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in the Retail Prices Index, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of a pension in order for the annual increase to be in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index to 15 per cent.
From 6 April 2006 a new tax regime was introduced by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC which abolished most of the detailed limits previously imposed on pension schemes and replaced them with a more simplified approach.
Each member now has a Lifetime Allowance LTA initially set at 1.5 million and a new tax, called the recovery charge, is levied at retirement if the value of their pension benefit from all sources exceeds this amount.
For any member whose total benefit value on 6 April 2006 exceeded the LTA, transitional arrangements allowed them to register the higher value so that they would not be subject to a large retrospective recovery charge.
To qualify for this enhanced protection the member was required to opt out of fund membership as regards future service accrual in order to retain a final salary linked pension entitlement in respect of past service.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60.
However, each of the current Executive Directors has opted out of fund membership as regards future service accrual as a result of registering for enhanced protection with HMRC.
The detailed HMRC rules governing enhanced protection mean that it may not be permissible in some rare circumstances for the full final salary linked pension based on service up to 6 April 2006 to be paid from the fund.
In this event an additional pension will be paid by the Company through an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS so that the full accrued benefit may be provided.
Mr R Dyrbus and Dr F A Rogerson are in receipt of a salary supplement.
The supplement is paid in lieu of future pension service and accrual.
Each salary supplement was calculated by independent actuaries to provide an accumulation of benefit no greater than a total pension promise of two-thirds of final salary.
These supplements were discounted for early payment and employers National Insurance contributions and are non-compensatory.
The supplement for Mr R Dyrbus is 35 per cent of salary and for Dr F A Rogerson is 16.4 per cent of salary.
These amounts are non pensionable payments.
The following table provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and gives details for each Director of: the annual accrued pension payable on retirement calculated as if he had left service at the year end any potential UURBS entitlement is included : the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing Rules: and the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11.
None of the Directors has made additional voluntary contributions.

Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
Benefits The principal taxable benefits for Executive Directors are the provision of company cars and health insurance.
Remuneration from other Non-Executive Directorships The Company recognises that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
At the discretion of the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.
Each serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
Mr G Davis serves on the Board of Wolseley PLC and currently receives fees of 65,000 per annum.
Executive Directors service agreements The Group appoints Executive Directors under service agreements terminable by either party giving 52 weeks notice, as shown in the table below.
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination including following a change of control within Executive Directors service agreements.
However, the Group is unequivocally against rewards for failure.
The circumstances of the termination and an individuals duty and opportunity to mitigate loss are taken into account in every case.
The Groups policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the compensation period and that any such payments should be paid monthly in arrears.
Under the Rules of the LTIP and SMS, outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement, redundancy or on a change of control, on a time-related pro-rata basis subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria.
If, however, the termination of employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the Rules an individuals full award lapses.

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole with regard to market practice and within the restrictions contained in the Companys Articles of Association.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board following recommendation from the Remuneration Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions relating to their own remuneration.
They receive no other material pay or benefits with the exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company and provision of administrative support including the use of Company offices by the Chairman Mr D C Bonham and Joint Vice Chairman Mr A G L Alexander, do not participate in the Companys share plans, bonus schemes or incentive plans and are not eligible for pension scheme membership.
To align further the interests of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, it was agreed that a proportion of their fees be applied, after tax, to purchase shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
These shares are to be held by a nominee during the term of each Non-Executive Directorship.
Exceptionally, in respect of Mr D C Bonham and Mr A G L Alexander, this requirement has been waived due to their continued level of investment, as detailed above.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Summary Statutory Reports Following his retirement from the Board in January 2006, Mr S Huismans remains a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he received additional remuneration for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Non-Executive Directors Letters of Appointment The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company.
The terms of their appointments are reviewed annually.
These terms were reviewed for all Non-Executive Directors and confirmed on 59 30 January 2006.
The letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and prior to and at the AGM.
Under the terms of the Articles of Association of the Company, Non-Executive Directors stand for election at the first AGM following appointment and are subject to triennial re-election by shareholders and retire subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 at the AGM following their reaching 70 years of age.
There are no provisions regarding notice periods in their letters of appointment which state that the Director will only receive payment until the date their appointment ends and therefore no compensation is payable on termination.
The letters of appointment detail the time commitment expected of each Non-Executive Director.
Although there is no current maximum term of appointment for Non-Executive Directors, the Board is supportive of the best practice provisions contained in the Code.
Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans retired from the Board at the AGM in January 2006, having both been on the Board since demerger in 1996.
However, where the Board considers a Non-Executive Director is making a particularly valuable contribution, they may be invited to remain on the Board in excess of nine years.
In such instances the length of tenure of the Non-Executive Director would be relevant to the Companys deliberations as to the independence of the Non-Executive Director and he she would also be subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
It is proposed that Mr A G L Alexander, who has also been on the Board since demerger in 1996, will continue to serve on the Board and will therefore offer himself for re-election at the 2007 AGM.
Remuneration arrangements for former Executive Directors Mr S T Painter Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited, the Groups principal operating company.
The agreement, as amended in October 2001 and May 2004, runs to March 2007.
Under the terms of the agreement he provides consultancy services as required and receives fees at a day rate of 1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days service for each 12 month period ending on 30 June, and 67 days for the period 1 July 2006 to 6 March 2007.
He is also entitled to reimbursement for the use of his car.
Mr S T Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he receives additional remuneration for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Mr M A Hussler Mr M A Hussler is currently in receipt of a retirement pension that has been reduced because it has been taken before he reached his normal retirement age.
His service agreement with the Group provided that he would receive similar overall pension benefits to those that he would have received had he remained in the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH pension arrangement.
This was a pension for life equivalent to 42 per cent of his fixed annual salary at age 63.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension for life of 60 per cent of that amount would be payable.
The pension is made up of three parts: one part of the pension is payable from the unfunded pension arrangement of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, another part is payable from the separately funded Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund and the difference, which is not separately pre-funded, is paid by the Company.
The pension payable under the Reemtsma arrangement and from the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund may be increased annually in accordance with the Rules of those arrangements or as is required by law.
In accordance with Mr M A Husslers pension agreement the unfunded UK company portion was increased in line with the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund 2006 increase of 2.21 per cent, from 11,811.37 to 12,072.48 per annum.

The management structure is based on geographical regions.
These geographical regions of UK, Germany, Rest of Western Europe and Rest of the World have been used as the primary reporting segments.
The manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products is a single integrated business and as a consequence, the Group has only one business segment and no secondary segment disclosure has been made.
The central costs are allocated to segments on the basis of revenue less duty.

com Summary Financial Statements Notes to the summary financial statements continued 1 Segmental information continued Use of adjusted measures Management believes that reporting adjusted measures provides a better comparison of business performance for the year and reflects the way in which the business is controlled.
Accordingly, adjusted measures of profit from operations, net finance costs, profit before tax, taxation and earnings per share exclude, where applicable, restructuring costs, retirement benefit net financing income, fair value 64 gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and related taxation effects.
Reconciliations between adjusted and reported taxation are included in note 4 and between adjusted and reported earnings per share in note 6.
The term adjusted is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The principal adjustments made to reported profits are as follows: Restructuring costs These are significant one-off costs incurred in integrating acquired businesses and rationalisation initiatives.
Fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, the Group has decided not to apply hedge accounting as permitted under IAS 39 and we exclude fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments from adjusted measures where appropriate.
Retirement benefit net financing income The expected return on plan assets and the interest on retirement benefit liabilities is included within net finance costs.
Since these items do not impact cash flows and can be subject to significant volatility outside of managements control they have been eliminated from adjusted measures of net finance costs, profit before tax and earnings per share.
2 Restructuring costs In s million 2006 2005 Employment related mainly termination 23 36 Fixed asset write offs and impairment 17 13 Other operating charges 5 8 45 57 In 2006 restructuring costs were primarily in respect of the closure of our Liverpool and Lahr factories.
In 2005 restructuring costs were in respect of the closure of our tube factories in Plattsburgh and Montreal, the cigarette factory in Dublin, the rolling papers factory in Treforest and a significant headcount reduction at the Berlin cigarette factory.

This amounts to 295m based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2006.
At the date of the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved the final dividend at the Annual General Meeting and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
com Summary Financial Statements Notes to the summary financial statements continued 6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held to satisfy the Groups employee share schemes and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued on conversion into ordinary shares of rights held under the employee share schemes.

The Group had been the long term licensee of the trademark following the acquisition of Reemtsma in 2002.
Given the global growth potential of the brand, the Directors consider that the Davidoff cigarette trademark has an indefinite life and is therefore not subject to amortisation.
It is, however, subject to an annual impairment review under the requirements of IAS 36.
During 2006 the Group acquired interests in a number of small businesses, including in February 2006 a 100% interest in Gunnar Stenberg AS, a tobacco and tobacco-related products sales and distribution company based in Norway.
The fair and book value of the net assets acquired were 2m, giving rise to goodwill of 11m.
