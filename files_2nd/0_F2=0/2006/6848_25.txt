Goodwill Cost m At 3 May 2004 113.1 Acquired through business combinations note 17 246.9 At 1 May 2005 360.0 Acquired through business combinations note 17 145.1 At 30 April 2006 505.1 All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations.
As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill has been allocated to business segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 130.0m 2005 - 130.0m to Pub Company, 118.9m 2005 - 114.0m to Pub Partners, 129.8m 2005 - 116.0 to Brewing Company, and 126.4m 2005 - nil to Belhaven.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9.0% 2005 - 9.0% and the growth rate used to extropolate the projected cashflows beyond the one year budgets of 2.0% 2005 - 1.75% inline with an expected long-term inflation rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to market growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
