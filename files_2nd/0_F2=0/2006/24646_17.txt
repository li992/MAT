34 notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 S TATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 30.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 30 June 2006 each financial year 31 March in previous accounting periods.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of entities acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of controlled entities to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Investments Non-current investments in unlisted companies are included in non-current assets and stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill cannot be reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
Credit hire and repair income and income derived from other accident management activities is recognised on transactions which have been completed during the period, together with an appropriate proportion of income in respect of hires and work in progress at the period-end.
Income derived from legal expenses insurance policy sales and deferred premiums is recognised on accruals basis, whilst other policy sales are recognised on a receipt basis or on an accruals basis where an element of the income is considered to be certain.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Finance charges relating to the vehicle hire fleet are charged to cost of sales.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
35 notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 S TATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Retirement benefit costs The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of employees at a fixed percentage of basic earnings.
The cost is charged to the income statement as the contributions fall due.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised when a non-monetary asset is separable, or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the asset cost can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful economic life on a straight-line basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Hire fleet 20% to 25% Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 15% to 31.33% Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
36 notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 S TATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is taken to reserves.
Financial assets Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated adjustments arising in settlement.
Financial liability and equity Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain directors and employees.
These payments are measured at fair value excluding the effects of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before investment income and finance costs.
37 notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 S EGMENTAL INFORMATION The financial statements are in respect of the Groups sole business segment of non-fault accident service provisions, conducted wholly in the United Kingdom.

Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Albany CGU 43,405 42,644 Swift CGU 23,647 Previous Acquisitions segment comprising several CGUs 1,453 1,453 68,505 44,097 The other changes in goodwill of 761,000 related to subsequent amendments to the fair values of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of the Albany CGU in 2005.
This related principally to the re-assessment of taxation liabilities at the date of acquisition.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the remaining period based on estimated growth rate.
For reasons of prudence the growth rate used for extrapolation was 0%, with 5% per annum decline in the final five years.
The total finite useful economic life at the Albany and Swift CGUs for purpose of the impairment review was assumed to be 20 years.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 6.3%.
At 30 June 2006, before impairment testing, goodwill of 1,453,000 was allocated to the Previous Acquisitions segment.
Due to reduced business performance and refocusing of these businesses the Group revised its cash flow forecasts for this CGU and an impairment loss of 1,453,000 was recognised in the year ended 31 March 2005.

Software development costs are not yet being amortised because their useful life has not yet commenced.
All leases of land and buildings are deemed to be operating leases.
The depreciation charge on the vehicle hire fleet represents a critical judgement made by the Directors.
The Group operates a large fleet of hire vehicles.
Depreciation on these vehicles is intended to reduce the carrying value of the vehicles to their expected residual value on disposal.
However, the residual value attributable is dependent on conditions present in the future and is subject to movements in the market for nearly-new vehicles.
As such, this area is inherently judgemental and is a key source of estimation uncertainty.
15 INVESTMENTS The investment in the consolidated balance sheet represents an investment in an unlisted entity.
A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given in note 36 to the Companys separate financial statements.
43 notes to the consolidated financial statements 16 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 30 June 2006 31 March 2005 000 000 Trade receivables 127,302 83,178 Expected adjustments arising on settlement 15,392 11,715 Trade receivables net 111,910 71,463 Other debtors 9,675 6,504 Prepayments and accrued income 3,936 3,338 VAT recoverable 417 253 125,938 81,558 Trade receivables represents amounts receivable for the provision of services to customers.
The expected adjustments arising on settlement is estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience.
Credit risk is spread across major motor insurers in proportion to their respective share of the market.
The average credit period taken by customers is 206 days.
The expected adjustments arising on settlement of receivables represents a critical judgement made by the Directors.
By their very nature, claims against motor insurance policies can be subject to dispute with a consequent requirement to reach a settlement with the counterparty.
The Directors have reduced trade receivables to reflect the expected future adjustments on settlement on the basis of the level of adjustments arising historically.
However, this area is inherently judgemental and is a key source of estimation uncertainty.

The average lease term is 1.76 years.
For the period ended 30 June 2006 the average effective borrowing rate was 6.89% 2005 8.23%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in sterling.
The fair value of the Groups finance lease obligations approximates to their carrying value.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.

These facilities expire after two years and attract an interest rate of 1.5% above LIBOR.
Security is provided by a fixed and floating charge over the Groups assets which encompasses cross guarantees between subsidiaries.
A further facility of 34.5m in the form of two term loans, a and b, and guaranteed loan notes were provided by Bank of Scotland in 2005.
Term loan a, amounting to 6.3m, is repayable from 30 September 2006 and must be repaid in full by October 2011.
Term loan b, amounting to 11m, is repayable in full by October 2011.
Term loan a attracts an interest rate of 1.5% above LIBOR.
Term loan b attracts an interest rate of 2% above LIBOR.
The loan notes were issued to fund the acquisition of Albany and are guaranteed by the Bank of Scotland, the Groups bankers.
The loan notes are redeemable in full upon receipt of 30 days written notice.
Interest is charged using the base rate published by the Bank of Scotland.
Upon redemption the loan notes are to be converted into term loan a and will be subject to the same repayment terms as above.
Further loan notes totalling 4,022,000 were issued on the same terms during the period to fund the acquisition of Swift Rent-A-Car Limited.
The directors consider that the fair values of the Groups borrowings was equal to their book value.
Subsequent to the period-end, on 25 July 2006, the Group secured a new three year revolving credit facility of 25m with Royal Bank of Scotland.
The new facility is repayable in full on 25 July 2009 and is subject to interest at 0.95% above LIBOR, rising to 1.05% or 1.40% above LIBOR if the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA exceeds certain levels.
The new facility is secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the Group.
45 notes to the consolidated financial statements 20 DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30% 2005 30%.
The deferred tax liabilities and assets, and movements thereon, recognised by the Group are set out below: Liability Liability Asset Intangible Accelerated tax Liability Asset Share-based Asset assets depreciation total tax losses payments total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2004 3,061 1,085 4,146 Acquisition of subsidiary 2,053 2,053 Charge credit to income 314 314 11 11 Charge credit to equity 162 162 At 1 April 2005 1,739 1,739 3,050 923 3,973 Acquisition of subsidiary 86 170 256 1,024 1,024 Charge credit to income 860 1,332 472 486 54 540 Charge credit to equity 2,276 2,276 At 30 June 2006 965 1,502 2,467 3,588 3,145 6,733 At the balance sheet date the Group has unused trading losses of 15m 2005 22.7m available for offset against future trading profits.

47 notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS 30 June 31 March 2006 2005 000 000 Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised in income for the period 19,781 12,229 At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Within one year 4,998 2,978 In the second to fifth years inclusive 1,898 1,175 After five years 1,172 1,706 8,066 5,859 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its motor vehicles, plant and equipment and properties.
Leases are negotiated for an average term of 2.97 years and rentals are fixed for an average of 2.34 years.
27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Equity settled share option plan The Group grants options to certain directors and employees.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is generally three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of seven years from the date of grant the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the options outstanding during the period are as follows: 15 months to Year ended June 2006 31 March 2005 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average options exercise price options exercise price 000s 000 Outstanding at beginning of period 6,303 1.50 7,231 1.20 Granted during the period 103 2.97 1,272 2.14 Exercised during the period 885 1.20 2,131 0.87 Forfeited during the period 55 1.88 69 1.65 Outstanding at end of period 5,466 1.57 6,303 1.50 Exercisable at the end of the period 1,601 1.08 1,451 1.12 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 310.97p.
The options outstanding at 30 June 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of 1.57 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.5 years.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, options were granted on 13 December 2004 and 29 March 2005.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was 688,000.
In the 15-month period ended 30 June 2006, options were granted on 2 September 2005 and 29 March 2006.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was 80,000.
The inputs to the Blacks-Scholes model are as follows: 15 months to Year ended June 2006 31 March 2005 Weighted average share price 2.98 2.09 Weighted average exercise price 2.97 2.14 Expected volatility 31.9% 32.9% Expected life 4 years 4 years Risk free rate 4.13% 4.45% Dividend yield 2.06% 2.30% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous four years.
The expected useful life in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 0.7m and 0.4m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the 15-month period ended 30 June 2006 and the year ended 31 March 2005 respectively.
48 notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Transactions between the Company and its subsidaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries are disclosed in the Companys separate financial statements.
Remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is provided in the audited section of the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 19 to 25.
29 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Subsequent to the acquisition of Albany in October 2004 and Swift in September 2005, certain liabilities have arisen in the acquired businesses relating to matters arising prior to acquisition by Helphire Group plc.
These liabilities were not foreseen at the date of acquisition.
The Directors have estimated the likely impact of these matters and recognised associated liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
1.6m of the liabilities were identified within one year of the relevant acquisition and have been recorded as adjustments to the fair values of the acquired liabilities.
0.6m arose after one year of the relevant acquisition and have therefore been treated as an expense in the current period.
Whilst the nature of the items concerned is such that it is not possible at the current time to precisely determine the amount of the liability, the Directors consider that suitably reliable estimations can be made and have recorded liabilities on this basis.
The Directors anticipate making warranty claims against the former owners of both Albany and Swift in respect of the above liabilities.
However, such claims are at an early stage and it is not possible to assess their success, or otherwise, with sufficient certainty.
As such, warranty claims are considered contingent and no asset has been recorded in the accounts.

IAS10 requires dividends to be recognised as a liability only when they are approved.
For a final dividend this is when they are approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
For an interim dividend this is when they are approved by the Board.
2 Share-based Payments Under UK GAAP no profit and loss account charge was required in respect of remuneration paid to directors and employees by means of granting share options.
IFRS 2 requires that share-based payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement at fair value.
The expense is based on the fair value of the share award at the date of grant.
The fair value is calculated using the Blacks-Scholes model and is applied to options granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 April 2005.
3 Intangible Assets IAS 38 requires the recognition of certain intangible assets acquired in business combinations, where this was not required under UK GAAP.
This includes ongoing contractual rights to supply, where the fair value of the relationship can be measured.
The directors have identified several customer contracts that on this basis should be treated as intangible assets.
These are amortised over two to four years.
The directors have also identified certain software licence and development expenditure classified as tangible fixed assets under UK GAAP which they believe more closely meet the definition of intangible assets under IAS38.
Accordingly these costs, which did not arise from business combinations, have been reclassified as intangible assets under IFRS.
4 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Fishers Solicitors Practice Limited Fishers is a member of Helphires panel of solicitors.
The directors have considered the nature of the relationship with Fishers against the requirements of IAS 27 and have concluded that it satisfies the definition of a subsidiary, whereas this was not previously the case under UK GAAP.
As such, the results of Fishers have been consolidated into these financial statements.
5 Business Combinations In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is carried at cost subject to impairment review.
The previous UK GAAP treatment was for goodwill to be amortised over its useful life.
Under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 the Group exercised its option of applying IFRS 3 prospectively from the date of transition to IFRS.
Accordingly, goodwill arising from acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004 is frozen at its written down value as at that date.
6 Impairment of Assets Impairment tests are carried out whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable, and also annually in the case of goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life and is not subject to amortisation and intangible assets not yet available for use.
An impairment loss is recognised in respect of the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, defined as the higher of the assets fair value and its value in use.
For the purposes of the assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
