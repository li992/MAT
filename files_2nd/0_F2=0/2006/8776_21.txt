JJB Sports plc Notes to the Financial statements For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 1.
General information JJB Sports plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Impairment of goodwill The calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill requires a comparison of the present value of the cash-generating units for which goodwill has been allocated, to the value of goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet.
The calculation of present value requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating units and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The carrying amount of goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 29 January 2006 was 186,084,000 2005: restated 186,114,000 and following the impairment review, no impairment charge was necessary at either date.
Impairment of subsidiary undertaking The calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of subsidiary undertakings requires a comparison of the present value of the cash-generating units within the subsidiary undertakings to the value of those subsidiary undertakings in the Company balance sheet.
The calculation of present value requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cashgenerating units and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The carrying amount of subsidiary undertakings in the Company balance sheet at 29 January 2006 was 248,310,000 following a provision for impairment at that date of 40,851,000.
Legal penalty The basis of the estimation of the provision made against the legal penalty is set out within note 25 of these Notes to the Financial statements on page 60.

IAS 8 Changes in accounting estimate Following an impairment review on the value of goodwill in the Balance sheet a further review was carried out on the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment.
It was found that many items of property, plant and equipment had useful economic lives that more closely matched the length of the short term lease of the property in which they were constructed rather than the 10 year economic life which had formed the basis of the depreciation charge in previous accounting periods.
The useful economic lives of these items of property, plant and equipment have been restated with effect from 31 January 2005 and the rates have been changed as follows: The annual rate of depreciation for freehold land and buildings has been reduced from 2.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent.
The annual rate of depreciation for the costs of mezzanine floors within the Distribution Centre, together with other costs associated with the structure of the distribution centre and head office buildings, has been reduced from 10.0 per cent to 2.0 per cent.
Both the distribution centre and head office are freehold.
The annual rate of depreciation on certain categories of costs within the health clubs, retail stores, head office and distribution centre have been reduced from 10.0 per cent to 4.0 per cent or a percentage relative to the period of the lease of which the assets are situated, if lower than 25 years.
These categories of costs include electrical, air conditioning, plumbing and mechanical assets and the construction costs relating to swimming pools.
The impact of the review is a reduction in the level of depreciation charged in the Consolidated income statement, analysed across the following segments of the business as follows: 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 000 Stand-alone retail stores 2,701 Leisure Division 3,606 Head office and distribution centre 1,308 7,615 6.

Taxation The taxation charge shown in the Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 has been based on the current rate of taxation of 30 per cent 2005: restated 30 per cent.
52 weeks to 53 weeks to 29 January 30 January 2006 2005 Restated 000 000 Current taxation UK corporation tax 5,649 16,931 Foreign tax 57 208 Prior year adjustment 2,692 41 3,014 17,180 Deferred taxation Current period 5,131 107 Prior year adjustment 4,635 496 107 Taxation charge 3,510 17,287 The prior year adjustment to the Group current taxation charge of 2,692,000 in the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 has arisen as a result of the recent finalisation of a number of years corporation tax liabilities with the Inland Revenue.
Following the agreement of these corporation tax liabilities, the deferred tax liability arising on the difference between the net book value of property, plant and equipment and their tax written down value, has been recalculated and the provision has been reduced by 4,635,000 in the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
The prior period credits result in a reduction in the effective tax rate of 21.7 per cent, as shown below, to 10.4 per cent and will not recur.
The effective tax rate for 2007 will therefore be close to the standard rate of UK Corporation tax of 30 per cent.
The current taxation charge for the period can be reconciled to the profit before taxation shown in the Consolidated income statement as follows: 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 29 January 30 January 2006 2005 Restated 000 % 000 % Profit before taxation: 33,747 62,450 Tax at the currrent UK corporation tax rate 10,124 30.0 18,735 30.0 Tax effect of origination and reversal of timing differences 405 1.2 1,637 2.6 Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 372 1.1 421 0.7 Tax effect of prior year UK corporation tax adjustments 2,692 8.0 41 0.1 Tax effect of prior year deferred taxation adjustment 4,635 13.7 Effect of different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in other jurisdictions 64 0.2 273 0.5 Taxation charge and effective tax rate for the period 3,510 10.4 17,287 27.7 52 JJB Sports plc Notes to the Financial statements continued For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 11.

In June 2005, JJBs existing 100 million committed revolving bank credit facility expired.
This was replaced by a new 5 year 60 million revolving bank credit facility which commenced in June 2005.
Both facilities were arranged at interest rates fixed to LIBOR and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Loan notes were issued to the vendors of Blane Leisure Limited Sports Division in September 1998, as part of the consideration for the acquisition of that Company and its subsidiaries, under an instrument which provided that the notes were redeemable on any quarterly interest payment dates after 11 June 1999.
By a Deed of Variation dated 26 February 2001, the maturity date up to which the loan notes can be redeemed was extended to 28 April 2011.
Interest is payable on the loan notes at a quarterly rate linked to LIBOR and the loan notes are secured by an identical amount held in a bank account and shown under Current assets as Current asset investment, as described in note 20 of the Notes to the Financial statements on page 57.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Group and Companys borrowings to be the same as the carrying value.

Short term provisions Future rental costs on closed Legal operating units Dilapidations penalty Total 000 000 000 000 Group At 30 January 2005 restated 2,058 911 2,000 4,969 Created in the period 641 77 1,882 2,600 Utilised in the period 207 32 239 At 29 January 2006 2,492 956 3,882 7,330 Company At 30 January 2005 restated 396 681 2,000 3,077 Created in the period 309 136 1,882 2,327 Utilised in the period 27 32 59 At 29 January 2006 678 785 3,882 5,345 In the previous accounting period of 53 weeks to 30 January 2005, the future rental on closed operating units and dilapidation provisions were included within Trade and other payables.
The Directors are of the opinion that a more appropriate disclosure is to classify these liabilities as short term provisions and they have now been restated as shown above.
The provision in respect of future rental costs on closed operating units represents the estimated net cost of fulfilling the rental obligations of the Group and Company under lease contracts for the remaining term of the leases or the estimated date of assignment to a third party, if earlier.
The dilapidations provision is the best estimate of the present value of expenditure expected to be incurred by the Group and Company in order to restore its leasehold premises to the condition required under the individual lease agreements at the end of their term.
Legal penalty In August 2003, the Office of Fair Trading OFT adjudicated JJB to be guilty of price-fixing of certain replica kit products over a 2 year period during 2000 and 2001 and levied a penalty of 8.4 million.
JJB appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT against the OFTs decision on liability and against the level of the penalty itself.
The result of the appeal against the decision of the OFT on liability, although given mainly in favour of the OFT, included some elements that were found in JJBs favour.
The decision of the CAT in the appeal against the level of the penalty which was announced in May 2005 was to reduce the penalty to 6.7 million.
Acknowledging this decision, JJB had made a provision of 2,000,000 in respect of the penalty in the accounting period to 30 January 2005.
JJB was disappointed with the CATs judgement on liability and the consequent amount of the reduction in its penalty.
In consultation with its legal advisers, JJB determined the specific grounds on which it wished to appeal to a higher court, and was duly granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
This appeal was heard in May 2006 but the judgement is not expected to be handed down until after the date of the publication of these Financial statements.
On the basis of further legal advice regarding the appeal to the Court of Appeal and acknowledging the specific grounds on which JJB is appealing on together with the inherent uncertainty of the appeal process, JJB has decided to increase its provision against the penalty from 2,000,000 to 3,882,000 in its Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.

Financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows and consequently is a party to a number of US Dollar foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange rate exposures for approximately six months in advance, and are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At the Balance sheet date, the total amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group is committed to are as follows: 29 January 30 January 2006 2005 000 000 US Dollar forward currency contracts 13,353 10,464 At 29 January 2006, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be approximately 13.0 million 2005: 10.7 million.
A provision has been made at 29 January 2006 of 70,000 2005: NIL, being the element of the loss arising from the difference between the sterling value of forward foreign exchange contracts and their fair value, that is not already committed to suppliers.
Disclosures in respect of financial instruments are given under the requirements of IAS 32.
The Group and Company have taken advantage of the exemption from applying IAS 32 in respect of the comparative period.
Accordingly, disclosures in respect of that period are given below under the relevant UK GAAP standard, FRS 13.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13: Derivatives and other Financial Instruments.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary companies and short-term debtors and creditors other than those required for currency exposures are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
a Financial risks and policies Set out below is a summary of the main financial risks faced by the Group during the accounting period and the policies employed to address these risks.
These policies have been applied consistently throughout the accounting period and are explained in more detail in the Financial review on pages 10 and 12 of the Annual report.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy throughout the accounting period has been to use the revolving bank credit facility together with retained profits, to achieve continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through the revolving bank credit facility and its retained profits.
Floating rates of interest are charged on the bank facility.
No interest rate hedging agreement is currently in place because given the level of borrowings and the current interest rate environment, the Board does not consider fluctuations in interest rates to pose a significant risk to the Group.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups trading activities are conducted with United Kingdom suppliers and customers, the transactions being payable and receivable in sterling: only approximately 25 million of the Groups annualised purchases are settled in US dollars.
In December 2004, the Group entered into a series of forward contracts which covered its dollar requirements through to July 2005, at a fixed rate of exchange.
These contracts matured evenly in February, April and June 2005 and protected the Groups trading position and Balance sheet from significant exchange rate movements.
The Groups treasury department tracks the sterling dollar exchange rate on a continuous basis to minimise the Group risk to currency fluctuations.

First time adoption of IFRS continued Notes to the Reconciliations IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards In implementing the transition to IFRS, JJB has followed the requirements of IFRS 1, which in general requires IFRS accounting policies to be applied fully retrospectively in deriving the opening balance sheet at the date of transition.
Significant accounting policy changes, together with the relevant transitional provisions, and their effect on the Financial statements of the Group are explained within this section of the Financial statements.
However, IFRS 1 contains certain mandatory exceptions and some optional exemptions to this principle of retrospective application.
The relevant transitional provisions are set out where applicable below.
IFRS 3 Goodwill and business combinations JJB has elected to take the exemption available under IFRS 1 to not apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to goodwill and business combinations arising before the date of transition to IFRS.
Goodwill arising on such acquisitions has therefore been retained at its UK GAAP carrying value at 25 January 2004.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising as a result of the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking was amortised over 20 years.
However, under IFRS, no amortisation charge is to be made.
Instead, any goodwill recognised in the Balance sheet, is subject to an annual impairment review, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
JJB has carried out an impairment review of the carrying value of its goodwill at 25 January 2004 and found that no charge for impairment was necessary from this date to 29 January 2006.
The effect of this review has been to reverse the goodwill amortisation originally made against the Consolidated income statement for the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005, increasing the Consolidated profit before taxation by 12,989,000.
IAS 10 Events after the Balance sheet date IAS 10, requires that dividends should now be recognised only when they are declared and approved, rather than being accrued for in the period to which they relate, as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Compared to the UK GAAP treatment this has the effect of deferring the recognition of dividends to the following accounting period.
In addition, dividends are to be shown as a movement directly in equity instead of through the Consolidated income statement.
The final dividend declared in April 2004 for the 52 weeks to 25 January 2004 of 16,150,000 has been taken out of the Balance sheets at that date and charged to equity in the accounting period for the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005.
Similarly, the final dividend for the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005 of 16,154,000, has been taken out of the Balance sheets at that date and has been charged to equity in the accounting period of 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
IAS 12 Income taxes IAS 12 takes a Balance sheet approach to deferred tax whereby deferred tax is recognised in the Balance sheet by applying the appropriate tax rate to the temporary differences arising between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
This contrasts with UK GAAP FRS 19, which considers timing differences.
Previously under UK GAAP, there was no requirement to provide deferred tax in respect of those assets against which capital gains rollover relief had been claimed.
Under IAS 12, deferred tax must be provided against the difference between the qualifying net book value of those assets and their reduced tax base cost.
Accordingly, the Group and Company deferred tax provision was increased by 2,591,000 at 25 January 2004, and increased by a further 386,000 during the accounting period of 53 weeks to 30 January 2005.
76 JJB Sports plc Notes to the Financial statements continued For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 42.
First time adoption of IFRS continued Notes to the Reconciliations continued IAS 17 Leases Under UK GAAP, operating lease incentives in respect of rent free periods, were recognised in the Consolidated income statement over the period to the date of the first rent review.
In accordance with IAS 17, all lease incentives must now be recognised in the Consolidated income statement over the full term of the lease.
The effect of this Standard has resulted in an adjustment carrying forward an increased amount in the value of rent free periods in deferred lease incentives within liabilities totalling 15,077,000 in respect of the Group and 12,482,000 in respect of the Company at 25 January 2004.
In respect of the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005, adjustments have been made to reduce the Group operating profit by 913,000 and the Company operating profit by 1,087,000.
As a result of these changes to operating lease incentives, further corporation tax adjustments were made in the Financial statements to tax liabilities, of 4,523,000 in respect of the Group and 3,745,000 in respect of the Company at 25 January 2004, with a further adjustment of 274,000 in respect of the Group and 326,000 in respect of the Company at 30 January 2005.
IAS 33 Earnings per share The method of calculating earnings per share has not changed on the transition to IFRS, however the actual calculations have changed as a result of those restatements on the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS which affect profit.
Other adjustments Certain adjustments are included within the Other adjustments column in the Reconciliations shown in this section of the Financial statements: the major items are referenced to the notes below.
a Presentation of Financial statements Management have taken the opportunity on the IFRS transition to review all their accounting policies.
As a result of this review, reclassifications were made from trade and other payables to trade and other receivables of prepayments which had previously been set off against purchase ledger balances The adjustments were made at 25 January 2004, of 24,316,000 in respect of the Group 18,411,000 in respect of the Company and at 30 January 2005 of 23,611,000 in respect of the Group 18,963,000 in respect of the Company.
At 30 January 2005, the short term provisions in respect of future rental costs on closed operating units and dilapidations were included within Trade and other payables and have now been restated within liabilities as Short term provisions.
The Directors are of the opinion that these reclassifications give a more accurate Balance sheet position.
b IAS 21 The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates Under IFRS, exchange differences arising on consolidation on the translation of overseas subsidiaries are required to be recognised as a separate equity reserve.
JJB has utilised the exemption available in IFRS 1 whereby cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS: the profit or loss on all subsequent disposals will therefore exclude any translation differences arising prior to 25 January 2004.
Financial instruments In accordance with IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group elected not to restate comparative information for the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 in respect of the accounting period of 53 weeks to 30 January 2005.
There was no material impact with regard to the comparative figures.
