106 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
They have been drawn up to comply with applicable UK accounting standards.
The Company has taken advantage of the provision of FRS 1 revised which exempts subsidiaries, 90 per cent or more of whose voting rights are controlled within the Group, from preparing a cash flow statement.
The required consolidated cash flow statement has been included within the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
2 Change in accounting policies There have been no changes in accounting policies during the year.
3 Summary of significant accounting policies Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Taxation Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or liability, at appropriate rates, in respect of transactions and events recognised in the financial statements of the current and previous periods which give the entity a right to pay less, or an obligation to pay more, tax in future periods.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which they can be recovered.
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would arise from the future disposal of any fixed assets shown in the accounts at valuation, except to the extent that at the balance sheet date there is a binding sale agreement.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Foreign currency translation The presentation and functional currency of Ladbrokes plc and the functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries is sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All foreign currency translations are taken to the consolidated income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a post tax hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.
Non monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of initial transaction.
Non monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
The main functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries is the Euro.
At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
The post tax exchange differences arising on the retranslation, since the date of transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign entity is recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payment transactions The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given on page 96, note 33 of the consolidated IFRSs financial statements.
In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc market conditions.
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Company at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Pensions The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, a funded defined benefit group plan.
The pension cost relating to the scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected credit unit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to equity in the periods in which they arise.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of defined benefit obligations adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any net defined benefit surplus is limited to unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
ESOP trusts Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity.
Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds and no gain or loss is recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on the purchase, sale or cancellation of these shares.
