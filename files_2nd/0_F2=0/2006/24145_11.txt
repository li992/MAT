EEV is the basis we find more useful because it provides a more representative reflection of the performance of the long-term business that fully recognises the shareholders interest in the in-force portfolio on a risk adjusted basis.
The key differences between the EEV and IFRS bases of accounting are set out on page 32.

Overall profit from our life & pensions businesses is unchanged but there has been an 18% decrease in profit at our Asset Management business, 2005 524m where we have seen a net outflow of funds and resulting lower revenues.
Group EEV profit before tax has reduced by 34% to 398m 2005: 600m.
This profit measure takes into account the impacts of investment return variances, Group EEV profit before tax economic assumption changes, non-recurring items and other costs.
Underlying profit by business segment Underlying profit before tax There was a reduction in underlying profit excluding corporate items in UK Life & Pensions of 4%, an increase in International Life & Pensions of 12% and a reduction in Asset Management of 8%.
Included in underlying 2006 2005 profit before tax is a charge for persistency of 68m with 21m in respect of the current pension products, and the balance relating to legacy products.
This charge has largely been offset by a lower cost of burnthrough in 2006 of 36m and favourable morbidity Business segment 2006 2005 and mortality assumption changes of 27m.
Commentary on the segmental results is UK Life & Pensions 58% 60% given on pages 17, 23 and 29. International Life & Pensions 23% 20% Corporate items included in underlying profits total 14m negative 2005: 18m Asset Management 19% 20% negative.
These costs include STICS interest.
Details are shown in the table on page 30 with the main item being corporate costs which amount to 13m 2005: 12m.
The expected return on the net pension liability has increased in 2006 mainly because the calculation includes the expected return on derivative assets for the first time.
Contribution from Life & Pensions The contribution from total Life & Pensions new business, included in underlying new business profit, has increased by 42% to 204m 2005: 144m.
The new business margin as a 2006 42% 204m percentage of PVNBP has increased from 2.7% to 2.9%, largely driven by 30% sales 2005 2005 85% 144m 144m growth in the UK where operational leverage increased the margin from 2.0% to 2.6%.
Life & Pensions return on embedded value The Life & Pensions return on embedded value has decreased from 11.2% to 9.9% 2006 -12% 9.9% reflecting unchanged underlying profit and higher opening net assets on an EEV basis.
The UK return is 7.9% 2005: 9.4% and the International return is 19.8% 2005: 21.5%, 2005 11.2% which reflects the much higher proportion of new business profit to embedded value compared with the UK business.
Other profit items The other profit items excluded from underlying profit but included in profit before tax are shown in the table on page 30 and total 111m negative 2005: 76m positive.
2006 negative 111m The main factors impacting 2006 were good equity returns which generated a positive 2005 positive 76m impact, but these were offset by an increase in fixed interest yields which resulted in a negative impact.
In addition, investment return variances were negatively impacted by an increase in the market value of our 290m convertible bond reflecting the increase in Friends Providents share price over the year and by an increase in the investment related costs of options and guarantees.
The positive variance was significantly higher in 2005 as equity returns were higher and fixed interest yields fell both of which generated significant positive impacts.
The risk free rate used for Sterling was 4.6% 2005: 4.1% and 4.1% for the Euro 2005: 3.6%.
Non-recurring items comprise: F&C integration costs of 7m 2005: 24m, F&C Reinvestment Plan costs of 12m 2005: 22m relating to the share schemes put in place at the time of the merger, FPI integration costs of nil 2005: 6m, a release of mis-selling provisions of 4m 2005: charge of 7m and costs associated with the closure of the Appointed Representative sales channel of 2m 2005: nil.
The reduced amortisation of Asset Management intangible assets of 43m 2005: 56m reflects a lower book value of these assets as a result of impairments, partially offset by a higher amortisation rate implemented during 2006.
The impairment charge of 58m 2005: 112m arises from reviewing the fair value of the intangible assets associated with F&C investment management contracts following the loss of mandates.

EEV explicitly recognises new business profit in year of sale by prudently estimating future cash flows and The key differences between the IFRS and EEV bases are in respect of the discounting these using an appropriate risk discount rate.
Underlying IFRS profits tend to be lower than IFRS recognises only the statutory surplus on new EEV profits when new business volume is growing because EEV business and some acquisition costs front end fees are recognises future cash flows in profit, while IFRS does not.

The total Life & Pensions underlying profit was 136% up in 2006 with increased volumes of new business generating higher new business strain being 2005 224m offset by higher profits from in-force business and positive basis and regulatory changes.
The underlying profit from Asset Management fell by 18%, mainly arising from the withdrawal of funds as a result of corporate activity.
Group IFRS profit before tax from continuing operations has increased by 34% to 491m 2005: 367m.
This profit measure takes into account the actual investment IFRS profit before tax returns achieved during the year, offset by the impacts of non-recurring and other 2006 34% 491m items.
It is also shown gross of policyholder tax and minority interests.
In net terms 2005 367m these were 91m positive in 2006 and 143m positive in 2005, as discussed below.
UK Life & Pensions underlying profit UK Life & Pensions underlying profit has increased by 84% to 254m 2005: 138m.
2006 84% 254m New business strain in UK Life & Pensions has increased to 96m 2005: 82m due to increased new business volumes, offset by higher deferred acquisition costs.
In 2006, 2005 138m 216m 2005: 190m of acquisition expenses were deferred.
The in-force profit has increased to 298m 2005: 157m, primarily due to the basis and reserving changes for morbidity on protection business following significant improvements in claims experience of 123m and changes in reserving rules arising from PS06 14 of 33m.
The PS06 14 rules are being phased in by the Group over 2 years and we anticipate a similar impact on IFRS profits in 2007.
The other underlying profit component is the expected return on shareholders net assets of 52m 2005: 63m.
For 2007, these rates of return will all be increased by 0.75% to reflect increases in interest rates.
International Life & Pensions underlying profit International Life & Pensions underlying profit amounts to 71m 2005: nil made 2006 71m up of FPI of 57m 2005: 11m loss, Lombard 13m 2005: 9m and other 1m 2005 nil 2005: 2m.
New business strain in International Life & Pensions has fallen to 28m 2005: 33m as a result of a change in business mix enabling more acquisition costs to be deferred.
In 2006, 116m 2005: 82m of acquisition costs were deferred.
The in-force profit has increased to 98m 2005: 31m due to growth in the size of the in-force book and to changes in actuarial funding which contributed 26m for FPI 2005: negative valuation adjustments of 21m.
Asset Management underlying profit Asset Management underlying profit has reduced by 18% to 89m 2005: 108m.
m 2006 -18% 89m For the Asset Management business, underlying profit under IFRS is the same as for EEV and is discussed on page 29.
2005 108m Corporate items Corporate items included in underlying profit total 14m negative 2005: 22m negative.
2006 14m negative These comprise the expected return on the net pension liability of 9m positive 2005: 2m negative, expected return on corporate net assets of 10m negative 2005: 6m 2005 22m negative negative, less corporate costs of 13m 2005: 14m.
Other profit items The other profit items excluded from underlying profit but included in profit before 2006 -36% 91m tax are shown in the table on page 32 and total 91m 2005: 143m.
The non-recurring 2005 143m items, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are the same as under EEV and discussed on page 31.
Policyholder tax and returns on Group controlled funds attributable to third parties the latter mainly representing the minority interest held in F&C Commercial Property Trust, which is 53% owned by the Groups long term funds are excluded from underlying profit as neither is attributable to shareholders.
The short-term investment return fluctuations of 39m negative 2005: 102m positive reflect differences between the actual and expected investment market returns.
Within the calculation of underlying IFRS profit as in EEV we account for the STICS as debt to reflect the economic reality.
However, IFRS rules require that STICS should be accounted for as equity in calculating IFRS profit before tax and consequently STICS interest is added back and treated as an appropriation of profit.

Significant contributions to this increase are: 151m from the impact of implementing the reserving rule changes in PS06 14 for some products, and 123m from the release of excess prudence in morbidity reserves on income protection business.
When we complete the implementation of the changes in PS06 14 for the remainder of the affected products, we expect there to be a similar in-force item for 2007.
The new business strain has increased to 295m 2005: 261m due to increased levels of new business, partially offset by lower new business strain due to the reserving basis changes.
The in-force surplus has increased to 507m 2005: 253m mainly as a result of the above impacts.
The tax credit of 34m 2005: 100m arises from the offset of taxable profits against increased expenses following losses on the fixed interest investment portfolio.
The 2005 figure benefited from relief for brought forward tax losses.
We expect tax credits to arise in future periods, albeit at a lower level than in 2006.
