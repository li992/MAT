Changes in accounting policies During the year, the Company has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement, and FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The adoption of FRS 17 has not had any impacts on the results, assets or liabilities of the Company.
Under FRS 17, the Company accounts for pensions as if the National Grid UK Pension Scheme was a defined contribution scheme.
Disclosures in respect of the scheme are provided in note 8 to the Group accounts.
FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in a change to the timing of recognition of the Companys proposed final dividend.
Previously such dividends were recorded as a liability in the year in respect of which they are proposed by the Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders.
In accordance with FRS 21, such dividends are not recorded until approved.
As there was no proposed final dividend at 31 March 2005, the adoption of FRS 21 has not resulted in a prior year adjustment in accordance with FRS 3 and there is no change to net assets reported as at 31 March 2005.
FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The adoption of FRS 23, FRS 25, FRS 26 and FRS 29 has resulted in a change to the accounting for the Companys financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments and available for sale investments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, whilst deferred gains and losses relating to items qualifying for hedge accounting are derecognised and instead recorded in equity for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or by adjusting the carrying value of the hedged financial instrument for fair value hedges.
As permitted by the transition provisions of FRS 26, prior year adjustments have not been made to the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 or to the profit and loss account for the year then ended.
The adoption of FRS 23, FRS 25, FRS 26 and FRS 29 reduced net assets at 1 April 2005 by 52 million, as shown below: m Borrowings 161 Derivative financial instruments 44 Other assets and liabilities 65 Net assets 52 It is not practical to calculate the impact of the adoption of FRS 23, FRS 25, FRS 26 and FRS 29 on the results for the year ended 31 March 2006.
The Company has reclassified amounts owed to the Group undertakings as borrowings where these are interest bearing.
These amounts were previously disclosed within other creditors.
The impact of this change on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2005 is to increase borrowings falling due within one year and reduce other creditors falling due within one year by 657m and to increase borrowings falling due after one year and reduce other creditors falling due after one year by 840m.

Provisions for liabilities and charges Deferred Environmental  taxation Other Total m m m m m m At 31 March 2005 89 5 91 1,263 1,448 First time adoption of FRS 26 38 38 Charged to profit and loss account 18 60 41 30 67 Transferred to reserves 6 6 Utilised 2 118 2 122 Unwinding of discount 1 1 Disposal of Group undertakings 44 404 448 At 31 March 2006 44 23 33 786 28 914 The environmental provision represents the estimated environmental restoration and remediation costs relating to a number of sites owned and managed by the Company.
At 31 March 2006, the environmental provision represented the net present value of the estimated statutory decontamination costs of old gas manufacturing sites discounted using a nominal rate of 5.25%.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but it is expected to be incurred over the period 2006 to 2057 with some 33% of the spend projected to be spent over the next five years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The Company has made its best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the profit and loss account.

Provisions for liabilities and charges continued The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2006 relating to gas site decontamination was 72m 2005: 127m, being the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above excluding the impact of changes in discount rate.
At 31 March 2006, 10m of the total restructuring provision 2005: 16m consisted of provisions for costs in respect of surplus leasehold properties.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision relates to business reorganisation costs.
