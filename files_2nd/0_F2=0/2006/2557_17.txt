All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1st June 2003 for the main UK and Irish schemes and 31st December 2005 for the secondary UK scheme.
Updated valuations for the first two schemes are being carried out at present.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the attained age method.

It will be paid on 28th July 2006 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 30th June 2006.
9 Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding excluding those held as Treasury Shares which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
In July 2005 a share split was approved at the Companys AGM and four 5 pence shares were issued for each existing 20 pence share.
The earnings per share have been restated for March 2005 to allow for easy comparison.
The basic earnings per share prior to the share split was 78.8 pence and the diluted earnings per share was 77.2 pence at 31st March 2005.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Impairment Review During the year management has carried out an impairment review for the goodwill carried in the balance sheet.
No impairments were identified as a result of the review.
All of the recoverable amounts were based on value is use.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: - Cash flow projections are based on board approved budgets for the financial year ending 2007.
- Long term growth rates of between 3% - 4%.
- The weighted average cost of borrowing WACB of the group of 5.28%.
The Directors are reasonably confident that the assumptions used above are accurate, although it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the assumptions were amended significantly.

$75 million of the borrowing is repayable in May 2013 and $50 million is repayable in May 2016.
In order to protect from any interest rate exposures and currency movements, the Company has entered into three cross currency swaps.
51 Notes to the Accounts 18 Derivative and Non-current Financial instruments Derivatives The Group uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to variable interest rates and currency movements.
Interest rate swap The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31st March 2006 was 18.5m 2005: 18.5m.
Under this swap, the Company receives interest on a 3 month LIBOR variable basis and pays interest fixed at a rate of 4.67%.
The instrument matures in April 2006.
Interest rate cap The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate cap contract at 31st March 2006 was 13.5m 2005: 13.5m.
This instrument matures in December 2007, it caps interest rates at 6.00%.
The BSS Group PLC has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.
No embedded derivatives existed as at 31st March 2006 2005: nil.
Currency swaps In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the private placing of $125 million described in note 17, the Company has entered into three cross currency swaps to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire duration of the private placement.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the private placement to 72 million as well as fixing the exchange rates applicable to future coupon payments.
The currency swaps manage the Companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US dollar denominated borrowing on the private placing which was completed on 11th May 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps on the seven year borrowing of 29 million and 14 million that convert the borrowings on $50 million and $25 million respectively from 5.8 per cent to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a basis point increment of 64.75 and 66.79 respectively.
A further interest rate swap on the ten year borrowing of 29 million converts the borrowing on the $50 million debt from 5.8% to a fixed rate of 4.7% plus a basis point increment of 70.75.
At 31st March 2006 the fair value of currency derivatives, all of which terminate after more than five years from the balance sheet date, was estimated at 0.3m 2005: nil.
This amount is based upon the market value of equivalent financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these currency swaps are designated as effective.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings and bank borrowings approximate to book value.
The Group maintains a mixture of medium term and short term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group has sufficient funding for operations and planned expansion.
The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the Groups non-current liabilities, at 31st March 2006 was as follows: 2006 2005 m m In more than one year but not more than two years Bank term loan - 10.2 Finance leases and hire purchase contracts 0.3 0.4 Other financial liabilities 0.1 - In more than two years but not more than five years Bank term loan - 24.0 Revolving credit facility 70.0 7.0 Finance leases and hire purchase contracts 0.1 0.5 Other financial liabilities 0.4 0.4 Due after five years Other financial liabilities 0.2 0.6 71.1 43.1 52 Notes to the Accounts 18 Derivative and Non-current Financial instruments - continued Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed floating rate facilities at 31st March in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2006 2005 m m Expiring within 1 year - 1.4 Expiring between 1 and 2 years - - Expiring in more than 2 years 30.0 33.0 30.0 34.4 All these facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.

Notes i Type EXEC is an Approved and Unapproved Scheme, type PSP is the Performance Share Plan and type SAYE is a Save-AsYou-Earn Scheme.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Executive Executive SAYE SAYE options options options options Share price at grant date pence 180.1 157.2 177.1 156.9 Option exercise price pence 131.1 156.9 144.0 122.6 Expected volatility 25.4% 25.6% 24.4% 24.6% Option life years 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.2 Risk free interest rate 4.3% 4.4% 4.3% 4.4% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 2.7% 2.8% 2.7% 2.8% The expected volatility is based on historical share prices over a period of time equal to the vesting period.
The option life used is the average expected period to exercise, based upon historic patterns where appropriate.
The risk free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds on a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends based upon a 10% growth in dividends policy.
Also assumed is that performance conditions in respect of the executive share options and the performance share plan will be met, when assessing the likelihood that the options will be exercised.
