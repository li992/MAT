Segmental Analysis continued Management reporting For the purposes of exercising day-to-day managerial and budgetary control, the UK income statement is divided internally by product but these divisions are neither self-standing businesses nor cash generating units.
For the purpose of managing the UK business, most common costs are allocated entirely to classified directories.
Control is exercised by comparing performance against budgets that are agreed in advance.
The Chief Executive Officer reviews the revenue, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA before and after exceptional items within geographic segments.
EBITDA, before exceptional items, together with revenue and cash conversion, are the key financial measures that we use to assess the success of our business in achieving growth and operational efficiencies.
He also reviews the Groups adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA Cash Conversion and free cash flow to assess our efficiency in converting profit into cash.

Yell Group plc Annual Report 2006 Financial Statements 71 9.
Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
At 31 March 2006, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.
Supplementary earnings per share exclude exceptional costs net of tax and amortisation.

A goodwill charge of 5.8 million in 2005 arose from the recognition of tax net operating losses from acquisitions in the US and had nil effect on adjusted earnings per shares because the tax benefit was of equal amount.
Supplementary basic and diluted EPS have been calculated to exclude the effect of exceptional costs and amortisation.
The adjusted numbers have been provided in order that the effects of amortisation on reported earnings can be fully appreciated.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
There has been no impairment of goodwill in 2005 or 2006.
Goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated to the Group's cash generating units CGUs according to country of operation.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the geographical location in which the CGU operates.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used for value in use calculations were as follows: US UK m m Net book value Carrying value of goodwill 1,479.8 1,006.2 Growth rate 3.3% 2.2% Discount rate 8.5% 8.5% The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.

Pensions continued The 3.5 million actuarial loss reflects a 30.3 million increase in liabilities, net of 26.8 million actuarial gains in asset values.
The increase in liabilities in the year ended 31 March 2006 was primarily the result of declining real interest rates the reference market rate to which the discount rate is tied, net of expected inflation interest in the market price of certain government debt during the year.
The actuarial loss in the year ended 31 March 2005 was primarily the result of changing our assumptions regarding how long scheme members will live after retirement.
As the scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The history of experience gains and losses follows: Year ended 31 March 2005 2006 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Gain m 2.3 26.8 Gain proportion of scheme assets 2% 10% Experience losses on scheme liabilities and changes in assumptions: Loss m 34.6 30.3 Loss proportion of present value of scheme liabilities 14% 10% See page 59 for pension sensitivity examples.
