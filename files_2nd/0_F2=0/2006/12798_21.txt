Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group has previously prepared its financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
Following a regulation issued by the European Union, the Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements for the year to 19 August 2006 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value, and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
A summary of the principal Group IFRS accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds, except where indicated.
IFRS 1 exemptions IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, has been applied in preparing these financial statements.
The Group has elected to take advantage of certain transitional provisions within IFRS 1 which offer exemption from presenting comparative information or applying IFRS retrospectively: Business combinations the Group has elected to re-state all business combinations that took place between 1 September 1999 and 21 August 2004, under IFRS.
Financial instruments the Group has taken advantage of the exemption not to re-state comparatives for IAS 32 Financial Information: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
However, pro forma adjustments to the balance sheet have been presented in note 21, as if the Group had applied the principles of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 20 August 2005.
Share based payments IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity-settled awards after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Employee benefits the cumulative net deficit on defined benefit pension schemes at the transition date has been recognised in full in equity.
Property, plant and equipment the Group has adopted a valuation as deemed cost for land and buildings on transition to IFRS on 22 August 2004.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups future accounting periods but which the Group has not early adopted.
These are set out below: Effective for the Group for the financial period ending 18 August 2007: Amendments to IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions: Amendments to IAS 39 Fair Value Option: Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts: and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
Effective for the Group for the financial period ending 23 August 2008: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures: and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure.
The Group has considered the above standards, interpretations and amendments and concluded that they would not have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Basis of consolidation Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Punch Taverns plc and all its subsidiaries.
The Groups interests in its joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are carried at cost in the financial statements of the Company.
All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 53 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill carried in the balance sheet is not amortised.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 3 to 10 years Operating leases Over the term of the lease Property, plant and equipment Properties held at 22 August 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were revalued at that date and this revaluation is the deemed cost under IFRS.
Landlords fixtures and fittings include removable items, which are generally regarded as within landlord ownership.
These are depreciated in accordance with the policy detailed below.
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual values, by equal annual instalments as follows: Licensed properties, unlicensed properties and owner-occupied properties 50 years or the life of the lease if shorter Landlords fixtures and fittings, office furniture and fittings and motor vehicles 5 to 15 years Information technology equipment 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An annual assessment of residual values is performed and there is no depreciable amount if residual values are the same as, or more than, book value.
Residual values are based on the estimated amount which would be currently obtainable from disposal of the asset net of disposal costs if the asset were already of the age and condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Investment property Investment property is property held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation rather than for the purpose of Group operating activities or sale in the ordinary course of business.
Investment properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is consistent with the depreciation policy for owner-occupied properties.
Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
A review for indicators of impairment is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
When an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not exceeding cost.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic resources as a result of past events.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated taking account of any issue costs, and any discounts or premiums on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds, net of direct issue costs.
Convertible bonds On issue the debt and equity components of convertible bonds are separated and recorded at fair value net of issue costs.
The fair value of the debt component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
This amount is classified as a liability and measured on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in equity, net of income tax effects.
The carrying amount of the equity component is not re-measured in subsequent years.
Taxation Income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable, based on taxable profits for the year, and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or where the deferred tax asset or liability arises on an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Movements in deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
For properties acquired as part of a business combination, movements in the deferred tax liability resulting from indexation allowance are taken to the income statement until the tax base cost plus indexation allowance reaches the fair value on acquisition, and directly to equity thereafter for historic revaluation surpluses.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Leasing Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
A corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leases are accounted for as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the present value of scheme liabilities less the fair value of scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount within finance income or finance expense.
The cumulative net deficits on these defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in full in equity at the date of transition to IFRS and subsequent actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The Group also contributes to money purchase pension plans for employees.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 55 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities from 21 August 2005 The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations.
From 21 August 2005 such derivative financial instruments are initially accounted for and subsequently re-measured to fair value.
The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in forecast transactions.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement immediately.
The replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiry, sale or termination where such replacement or rollover is part of the documented hedging strategy.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities prior year comparatives The Group has taken the exemption available in IFRS 1 not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39.
As such, financial instruments are accounted for and presented in accordance with UK GAAP for the comparative period 52 weeks to 20 August 2005.
The Groups accounting policy for financial instruments under UK GAAP is set out below: Derivative financial instruments are held to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
To qualify as a hedge the financial instrument must be related to actual borrowings or a probable commitment and must reduce the risk of interest rate movements.
Gains and losses arising on these financial instruments are deferred and recognised in the income statement only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups accounts.
The costs or income associated with derivatives is recognised over the lesser of their duration or the period of the loans to which they relate, so as to give a constant proportion of the related loan notes outstanding.
In respect of the interest rate swaps, interest differentials are recognised by accruing for net interest payable or receivable.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value if they are being used for hedging purposes.
If an instrument, which was being used as a hedge, is terminated early, the gain or loss arising is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge because the underlying financial position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Share based payment transactions A number of employees of the Group including directors receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based on a binomial model, a beta model or the Black-Scholes model dependent upon the most appropriate valuation model for the individual scheme.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Punch Taverns plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
All operations take place solely in the United Kingdom.
Drink and food sales Revenue in respect of drink and food sales is recognised at the point at which the goods are provided, net of any discounts or volume rebates allowed.
Rents receivable Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Machine income The Groups share of net machine income is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amount.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of 3 months or less.
Cash deposits held as security for the benefit of note holders are not classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost calculated on a first in first out basis and net realisable value.
Non-current assets held for sale The Group has elected to apply IFRS 5 prospectively from the date of transition to IFRS.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification.
Dividend distribution Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Non-recurring and exceptional items In order to provide a trend measure of underlying performance, profit is adjusted to exclude items which management consider will distort comparability, either due to their significant non-recurring nature or as a result of specific accounting treatments.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgements including those relating to income taxes, deferred tax, financial instruments, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, valuations, provisions and post-employment benefits.
Management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 57 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill impairment The Group assesses whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These assumptions are disclosed in note 12.
Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Post-employment benefits The present value of defined benefit pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 31.
Any change in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of pension liabilities.
Authorisation of financial statements The Groups and Companys financial statements of Punch Taverns plc the Company for the period ended 19 August 2006 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 8 November 2006 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Giles Thorley and Robert McDonald.
Corporate information Punch Taverns plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England.
The Companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
com 2 Segmental analysis The primary segmental reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
The Group operates in two business segments: a leased estate and a managed estate.
The managed estate was acquired on 5 January 2006, through the acquisition of the Spirit group of companies.
Between 5 January 2006 and 19 August 2006, 74 pubs with a fair value of 93.2m have transferred from the managed to the leased estate.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom and therefore has only one geographical segment.
Capital expenditure 2006 2005 Leased Managed Total Leased m m m m 2 Acquisition spend 65.4 2,484.1 2,549.5 506.1 Investment spend 103.2 41.3 144.5 71.3 Total capital expenditure 168.6 2,525.4 2,694.0 577.4 2 Excludes the transfer of pubs from the managed segment to the leased segment.
With the exception of the transfer of pubs, there are immaterial sales between the business segments.
In the prior year there was only one segment, being the leased estate.
In the current year, segment assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories and receivables, and exclude cash, while segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and exclude taxation and corporate borrowings.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including additions resulting from acquisitions through business combinations.
In the period from the acquisition of the Spirit group to 19 August 2006, 351 managed pubs have been disposed.
These contributed 121m to revenue and 30m to EBITDA in the period.

com 6 Non-recurring and exceptional items In order to provide a trend measure of underlying performance, profit is adjusted to exclude items which management consider will distort comparability, either due to their significant non-recurring nature or as a result of specific accounting treatments.
Included in the income statement are the following non-recurring and exceptional items: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 19 August 20 August 2006 2005 m m Operating 1 Profits generated from pubs identified for disposal 4.7 Licensing reform costs, redundancy, costs to integrate acquisition of subsidiaries and other related one-off costs 8.2 7.5 8.2 2.8 Finance income 2 Other 0.3 Finance costs 3 Secured loan interest 0.1 1.3 4 Bank loan interest 3.2 5 Cost of terminating financing arrangements 9.3 0.1 13.8 6 Movement in fair value of interest rate swaps 39.7 Total non-recurring and exceptional items before tax 31.4 16.3 Tax Tax impact of exceptional items 9.4 6.2 7 Adjustments to tax in respect of prior periods 15.0 8 Tax charge on terminating financing arrangements 10.8 9 Release of tax provision 15.0 20.6 4.6 Total non-recurring and exceptional items after tax 52.0 20.9 1 Profits generated from pubs identified for disposal arise from the 545 pubs which were identified for disposal on the acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited on 10 September 2004 which were disposed of on 28 January 2005.
2 Funds were held in an escrow account to fund the cost of acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited.
The exceptional interest receivable relates to the proportion of funding relating to the 545 pubs of the total 1,064 pubs acquired on 10 September 2004 that were subsequently disposed of on 28 January 2005.
3 In the current period interest represents break costs incurred on the redemption of bank loans which were required to be repaid following the acquisition of the Spirit group.
In the comparative period interest was incurred on the secured loan notes acquired through the acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited, from the date of acquisition to their subsequent redemption on 21 October 2004.
The exceptional secured loan note interest charge represents the portion of the loan relating to the 545 of the total 1,064 pubs acquired that were subsequently disposed of on 28 January 2005.
4 A bank facility was drawn down to fund the acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited.
545 of the 1,064 pubs acquired were subsequently sold on 28 January 2005 with the receipts used to repay a portion of the facility drawn down.
The exceptional bank loan interest represents the interest and fees incurred on the portion of the loan relating to the 545 pubs from acquisition to 28 January 2005 when that portion was repaid.
5 In comparative periods the cost of terminating financing arrangements represents premiums paid to redeem secured loan notes acquired through the acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited, break costs incurred to cancel swap arrangements associated with these loans and premiums incurred to redeem secured floating rate notes as part of the debt restructure on 1 August 2005.
6 Represents the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Whilst the interest rate swaps are considered to be effective in matching the amortising profile of existing or planned floating rate borrowings, they do not meet the definition of an effective hedge due to the relative size of the mark to market difference of the swap at the date of acquisition or inception.
7 Adjustments to tax in respect of prior periods represents adjustments to current tax of 8.6m and deferred tax of 6.4m.
8 The creation of deferred tax assets on the fair value of swaps and loans acquired on the acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited was reversed on the termination of these financing arrangements, resulting in a non-recurring tax charge of 10.8m in the prior period.
9 During the period the tax treatment of an onerous contract has been clarified and the associated tax provision has been released.

Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 63 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two types of dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups incentive plans.
At 19 August 2006, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive schemes had been met and hence the shares have been included in the diluted EPS calculation.
The equity portion of the convertible bond has been assessed and its impact is dilutive on basic earnings and anti-dilutive on adjusted earnings.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 52 weeks to 19 August 2006 52 weeks to 20 August 2005 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m m pence m m pence Continuing operations Basic earnings per share 246.8 260.0 94.9 146.3 251.6 58.1 Effect of dilutive options 4.6 5.4 Effect of dilutive convertible bonds 12.3 15.9 Diluted earnings per share 259.1 280.5 92.4 146.3 257.0 56.9 Supplementary earnings per share figures: Basic earnings per share 246.8 260.0 94.9 146.3 251.6 58.1 Effect of: Non-recurring and exceptional items 52.0 20.9 Basic earnings per share before non-recurring and exceptional items 194.8 260.0 74.9 167.2 251.6 66.4 Diluted earnings per share 259.1 280.5 92.4 146.3 257.0 56.9 Effect of: Non-recurring and exceptional items 52.0 20.9 Reverse impact of convertible bonds 12.3 15.9 Diluted earnings per share before non-recurring and exceptional items 194.8 264.6 73.6 167.2 257.0 65.1 10 Dividends 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 19 August 20 August 2006 2005 m m Declared and paid during the year: Final dividend for 2005 for the 52 weeks ended 20 August 2005 of 7.6p 2004: 6.1p 20.0 15.3 Interim dividend for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 of 4.4p 2005: 3.7p 11.5 9.4 31.5 24.7 In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 19 August 2006 of 9.0p per share which will absorb an estimated 23.8m of shareholders funds.

These financial statements do not reflect this dividend payable, which has still to be approved by the Companys shareholders.

Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units CGUs based on the benefits to the Group which arise from each business combination.
The two groups of CGUs are identified by their pub operating format leased or managed and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.
The value of the goodwill was reviewed for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of the CGUs to the carrying value of their goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs was determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use is calculated using five year financial forecasts.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.25% growth rate August 2005: 2.25% for the remaining useful life of the CGUs.
This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the market and is in line with the UKs post-war average growth rate.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8% August 2005: 8%.
Included within operating leases are properties with a net book value of 156.4m August 2005: 21.8m over which the Groups borrowings are secured by way of fixed and floating charges.

Spirit Issuer plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.581% on the Class A1 and Class A2 debenture notes and, after their respective step-up dates, 4.555% on the Class A3, Class A4 and Class A5 debenture notes.
Although these swaps ensure that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes they were deemed ineffective at the time of acquisition of the Spirit group, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39, and accordingly all future movements in fair value will be recognised in the income statement.
Other bank loans held by Punch Taverns plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.572%.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the bank loans.
Other bank loans held by other Group companies Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.45%.
The interest rate exposure on the guaranteed loan notes is mitigated by the interest earned on the cash deposits used as guarantee.
At 20 August 2005 there were 169.3m of floating rate secured loan notes issued by Punch Taverns Finance B Limited which were repaid on 30 September 2005 following the Group refinancing on 1 August 2005.

com 20 Financial liabilities continued Convertible bonds The Group issued 275.0m 5.0% convertible bonds at a nominal value of 275.0m on 14 December 2005.
The bonds mature 5 years from the issue date and can be redeemed at that date for 107.21% 294.8m of their principal amount or can be converted, at the option of the holder, into shares at an initial conversion price of 11.782.
The conversion price is subject to adjustment following capital distributions whether by cash dividend, dividend in specie, scrip dividend, capitalisation issue or otherwise.
The share price at the date of pricing of the convertible bonds in the market was 8.60.
The fair values of the liability component and equity component were determined at issuance of the bonds.
The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The residual amount, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity as a separate reserve note 27, net of deferred income taxes.
The value of convertible bonds recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 19 August 20 August 2006 2005 m m Face value of convertible bonds issued on 14 December 2005 275.0 Deferred issue costs paid 9.3 Net proceeds 265.7 Equity component 30.0 Liability component at 14 December 2005 235.7 Finance cost note 5 15.0 Cash interest paid 9.3 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.1 Liability component at 19 August 2006 242.5 Finance cost on the bonds is calculated using the effective interest method by applying the effective interest rate of 9.23%.
21 Financial instruments The Group has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 21 August 2005.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 1 from the requirement to restate comparatives in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The comparative figures have therefore been measured and presented in accordance with previously adopted UK GAAP.
The principal impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the Groups financial statements relates to the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value.
All derivative financial instruments are held on the balance sheet at fair value: the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The adjustments to the opening balance sheet as at 21 August 2005 are as follows: Restated opening Opening Effect of position at balance sheet IAS 32 and 21 August under IFRS IAS 39 2005 m m m Non-current assets Receivables 11.7 8.8 2.9 Deferred tax asset 66.2 29.4 95.6 Current assets Trade and other receivables 78.5 2.0 76.5 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 206.3 2.9 203.4 Non-current liabilities Derivative financial instruments 101.4 101.4 Other liabilities 11.3 11.3 Impact on net assets 68.6 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 77 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 21 Financial instruments continued The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivative financial instruments, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all material transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Group has no material exposure to equity securities or commodity price risk and it is the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds, loan notes, bonds, and other bank loans.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging, where this is financially practicable, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
The Group has taken out derivative financial instruments such that 99.7% of all loans at 19 August 2006 August 2005: 94.2% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements see note 20 thereby largely eliminating the Groups exposure to changes in interest rates.
Interest on the bank loans held by Punch Taverns plc is paid monthly in arrears and, when combined with the interest rate swaps, is effectively fixed.
Interest on the secured loan notes and bank loans held by other group companies is paid quarterly in arrears.
Whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk such that the Group would not benefit from falls in interest rate and would be exposed to unplanned costs should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early.
Liquidity risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
The Group is primarily financed by secured loan notes, with approximately 93% August 2005: 88% of the capital balance on these loan notes being repayable after more than 5 years from the balance sheet date, subject to relevant covenants being met.
During the year bank facilities of 1,250m were arranged of which 1,216m was drawn down, part of which, together with the issuance of 275m of convertible debt, 75m of new equity and the retention of 1,250m of secured loans, was used to fund the acquisition of Spirit Group Holdings Limited.
621m of this facility remains outstanding at 19 August 2006.
The Board continues to review alternative sources of finance.
The Groups objective is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain a strong credit rating so maturing short term debt may be refinanced as it falls due.
Cash balances are invested in short term deposits such that they are readily available to settle short term liabilities or to fund capital additions.
com 21 Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet are as follows all non-current : Group Company 19 August 2006 19 August 2006 Non-current Non-current Non-current Non-current assets liabilities assets liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 5.8 152.1 5.8 Forward interest rate swaps 37.7 37.7 5.8 189.8 5.8 37.7 The interest rate swaps replace the LIBOR rate on the Groups secured floating rate loan notes and bank loans with a fixed rate.
The capital amount of the swaps reduce over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the associated notes over their life see note 20 for more detail.
Of the total carrying value of the interest rate swaps 53.7m qualify as, and are treated as, cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and movements in their fair values are recognised directly in equity.
The remaining 92.6m do not qualify for hedge accounting with movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement.
The forward interest rate swaps, swap LIBOR for a fixed rate of 5.837% on a nominal amount of 300m from 5 January 2009 to 5 January 2029 and are shown net of issue costs of 6.0m.
The forward interest rate swaps do not currently hedge any floating rate debt although it is likely they will be used by the Group either to hedge future loan arrangements or in the refinancing of existing loan arrangements.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups secured loan notes and convertible bonds, there are no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups secured loan notes at 19 August 2006 is 4,558.1m and the fair value, measured at market value or the market value of equivalent loans, of this debt at that date is 4,753.2m.
The carrying value of the convertible bonds is 242.5m at 19 August 2006 and the fair value, measured using present value of discounted cash flows, of these bonds is 245.3m.
Disclosures in respect of comparative period The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted under IFRS 1 not to apply IAS 32 and 39 retrospectively.
In accordance with IFRS 1 the disclosures in respect of the comparative period are presented in this note in accordance with FRS 13 Financial Instruments.

The weighted average period until maturity of the nil rate liabilities was 4.9 years.
The floating rate liabilities bear interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
Financial assets include sterling cash balances of 448.5m that earn interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
Cash balances include 30.7m of deposits used as security for guaranteed loan notes and 172.1m of monies raised from the refinancing of Punch Taverns Finance B Limited debt deposited on escrow to fund the redemption of floating rate debt and accrued interest on 30 September 2005.

All of these schemes are equity-settled schemes.
SAYE Scheme The first scheme is the savings related scheme which was open to all employees, whereby the proceeds from a Save As You Earn savings contract, of either three or five years duration, is used to exercise rights to acquire shares granted at the commencement of the savings contract at a discount of 20% to the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
Options may be exercised within six months of the maturity of the contract.
This scheme was introduced during the period ended 17 August 2002 with a further invitation to join during the period ended 23 August 2003.
There were no options granted under this scheme in the period ended 19 August 2006 or period ended 20 August 2005.
Discretionary Share Plan The second scheme is a Discretionary Share Plan DSP whereby options are granted to senior management over ordinary shares in the Company, at the prevailing market price at time of grant.
These are exercisable up to ten years after the date of grant, with performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee.
Performance targets for options granted on 31 January 2006 and 16 November 2005 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 10% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 17 November 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 2 March 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 15% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted between 5 December 2002 and 19 August 2003 are set at earnings per share growth of RPI 3% per annum.
The options granted under this scheme prior to 5 December 2002 do not have performance criteria, and will vest provided the employee to whom the options were granted remains within the Group up to the exercise date.
Long Term Incentive Plan The third scheme is a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP whereby senior management will receive conditional rights over ordinary shares in the Company.
Eligible employees are awarded rights to the issue of a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are satisfied.
Further information on the performance conditions of the Long Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Report on Directors remuneration.
At 19 August 2006 eligible employees hold rights over ordinary shares which may result in the issue of 351,718 shares on 2 March 2007, 10,266 shares on 15 June 2007, 251,743 shares on 17 November 2007, 297,296 shares on 16 November 2008 and 128,474 on 31 January 2009.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The fourth scheme is a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB whereby senior management receive part of their post-tax annual bonus in shares.
These shares are held on behalf of the senior management in a trust and if certain performance and eligibility conditions are met then a further award of shares is made after three years.
Further information is provided in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 31 to 44.
At 19 August 2006, 50,788 shares are held within the trust and eligible employees hold additional rights over ordinary shares that may result in the future issue of up to 52,986 on 17 November 2007 and 33,096 shares on 10 November 2008.
Share Incentive Plan The fifth scheme is a Share Incentive Plan SIP open to all eligible employees, whereby proceeds contributed by employees are used to buy shares in the Company at prevailing market values.
These shares are called Partnership Shares and are held in a trust on behalf of the employee.
For every Partnership Share bought by the employee the Company will give the employee one share free of charge Matching Share.
The employees have to take their shares out of the plan on leaving the Group and will not be entitled to the Matching Share if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares.
If the Company awards dividends to its shareholders, the employee will receive a dividend on each of the Partnership and Matching Shares they hold.
The Company arranges for the dividends to be used to buy extra shares Dividend Shares.
Dividend Shares must be held in the plan for three years before they can be removed unless the employee leaves the Company in which case they must be taken out.
The scheme was introduced in June 2004 with shares being acquired at market values on an annual or monthly basis.
As at 19 August 2006, 134,204 shares August 2005: 98,395 shares had been issued by the Company to the trust at par value.
The par value of the shares issued which has been deducted from reserves is negligible.

com 25 Share based payments continued Fair value of share awards The fair value is measured using the valuation technique that is considered to be the most appropriate to value each class of award.
The key assumptions for awards made in the period are detailed as follows: Discretionary Share Plan 31 January 16 November Grant date 2006 2005 Valuation model Binomial Binomial Share price at date of grant 8.66 7.67 Shares under option 64,257 149,996 Vesting period 3 years 3 years Expected volatility 27.30% 23.29% Expected life 5 years 5 years Risk free rate 4.2958% 4.3127% Expected dividend yield 1.64% 1.64% Expectation of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% Fair value per option 2.34 2.14 Expected volatility has been calculated based on the historic volatility of the Companys share price corresponding to the expected life of the option or share award.
The expected term of the options is based on the life to the point of expected exercise.
This is determined through analysis of historically evidenced exercise patterns of option holders.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Long Term Incentive Plan The fair value of awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan in the year have been determined taking into account the TSR performance condition attached to the awards and the expected dividend yield.
The estimated fair value of the awards made in the year are 3.83 for those awarded on 16 November 2005 and 4.34 for those awarded on 31 January 2006.
These fair values are based on an expected dividend yield of 1.64%.
Share Incentive Plan The fair value of the Matching Shares issued under the Companys Share Incentive Plan is recognised as the market value of the shares issued at the date of purchase.
This charge is spread over the 3 year vesting period on a straight line basis.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The estimated fair value of the deferred bonus shares awarded in the year are determined based on the market value of share on the date of grant discounted by the expected dividend yield.
The estimated fair value of shares granted in the year, under this scheme, is 7.36 based on an expected dividend yield of 1.64%.

2 2005 fair values relate to the acquisitions of InnSpired Group Limited on 10 September 2004 and Avebury Holdings Limited on 8 August 2005.
In the current year, the provisional fair value adjustments primarily relate to the revaluation of freehold and leasehold trading properties, the mark to market valuation of derivative financial instruments, the recognition of deferred tax liabilities on revalued properties, which gives the opportunity to roll over taxable gains on the acquisition of properties, and the revaluation of pension scheme liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Fair values are provisional at 19 August 2006 to enable the final assessment of potential tax and other liabilities.
The fair values presented in the interim statements were provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the interim date.
The fair values have been adjusted from those provisional fair values disclosed in the interim statements due to the disposal of 290 pubs on 25 June 2006, which has given better information on the fair value of those pubs on their initial acquisition.
Included in the 234.6m of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include infrastructure, an assembled workforce and operating synergies.

com 36 Transition to IFRS With effect from 21 August 2005 the Group is preparing its consolidated financial statements, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
For this purpose IFRS represent all International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards, as well as interpretations published by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee and its predecessor body, that were issued prior to 19 August 2006 and endorsed by the EU prior to authorisation of these financial statements.
The Groups financial statements were previously prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP, which differs in a number of areas from IFRS.
Therefore it has been necessary to amend certain presentation, accounting, valuation and consolidation methods previously applied under UK GAAP, in order to comply with IFRS for these financial statements.
The Group has previously prepared a separate, detailed description of the transition to IFRS and the nature of reconciling items from UK GAAP at the date of transition being 22 August 2004, and this is available on the website at www.
All comparative figures have been restated to reflect these changes, except for the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, which only applied from 21 August 2005.
As required under IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards the Group presents below a reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS for the following: the income statement for the 52 weeks to 20 August 2005: the balance sheet as at the date of transition of 22 August 2004: and the balance sheet as at the date of the last financial statements 20 August 2005.
At transition, the only impact on the Company relates to the recognition of dividends under IAS 10.
Reconciliation of the income statement for the 52 weeks to 20 August 2005 UK GAAP IFRS 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 20 August 20 August 2005 Remeasurement 2005 m m m Revenue 770.1 770.1 Operating costs before depreciation and amortisation 358.0 1.4 356.6 EBITDA 412.1 1.4 413.5 Depreciation and amortisation 19.3 5.8 13.5 Operating profit 392.8 7.2 400.0 Finance income 10.8 10.8 Finance costs 203.1 0.9 204.0 Profit before taxation 200.5 6.3 206.8 Income tax expense credit 43.8 4.2 39.6 Profit for the period 156.7 10.5 167.2 Non-recurring and exceptional items 10.1 10.8 20.9 Profit for the period 146.6 0.3 146.3 Dividends 28.7 4.0 24.7 Retained profit 117.9 3.7 121.6 Before non-recurring and exceptional items.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 101 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 36 Transition to IFRS continued Income statement remeasurement Operating costs Under UK GAAP, defined benefit pension schemes were accounted for using SSAP 24, with disclosures provided for the FRS 17 measurement principles.
IFRS takes a similar approach to FRS 17 and the Group has elected to apply the revised version of IAS 19 which allows actuarial gains and losses to be taken directly to equity.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 is to reduce operating expenses by 0.3m.
The accounting for leases under IFRS and UK GAAP is broadly similar except that IAS 17 requires the Group to consider property leases as separate land and buildings elements.
As a result a small number of building head leases have been reclassified as finance leases.
The impact on the income statement of this reclassification is that 1.1m operating lease expenses under UK GAAP are replaced with depreciation and financing charges for the building elements of the reclassified leases.
There is no net impact on the charge to the income statement over the life of the lease, but the timing of the expense will change.
Depreciation and amortisation Under IFRS 3, goodwill ceases to be amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
The amortisation charge of 6.5m for the year has been reversed.
The reclassification of building head leases as finance leases has resulted in an increase to depreciation and amortisation of 0.7m in the year.
Finance costs The reclassification of building head leases as finance leases has resulted in an increase to finance costs of 0.7m in the year.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 Employee Benefits is to increase finance costs by 0.2m in the year.
Income tax IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be calculated based on temporary differences, at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying value for financial reporting purposes.
Under UK GAAP it is not necessary to provide for deferred tax on capital gains that have been rolled over into replacement assets or arisen on revaluations.
Tax for the year to 20 August 2005 has been impacted by a 10.8m credit for indexation allowance and a charge of 6.5m following the utilisation of deferred tax assets relating to acquired tax losses.
Dividends IFRS does not permit unapproved dividends to be accrued at the year end.
The final dividend of 15.3m declared in November 2004, relating to the 2004 05 financial year, has been reversed in the opening balance sheet and charged to equity in the balance sheet as at 20 August 2005.
The final dividend of 19.3m declared in November 2005 has been reversed in the balance sheet as at 20 August 2005.
Non-recurring and exceptional items Under IAS 12 Income Taxes the creation of deferred tax assets on the fair value of swaps and loans acquired on the acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited was reversed on the termination of these financing arrangements, resulting in a non-recurring tax charge of 10.8m.

com 36 Transition to IFRS continued Balance sheet re-measurement Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets In accordance with the provisions within IAS 16 the Group has elected to carry property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Under UK GAAP freehold and long leasehold pubs were revalued on a rolling 5 year basis.
The Group elected to adopt to revalue the full estate at 22 August 2004, and record the surplus arising of 222.1m as a transitional adjustment.
The revaluation previously performed at 20 August 2005, resulting in an upward valuation of 128.2m, has been reversed under IFRS.
As a result a small number of building head leases having been reclassified as finance leases and brought on to the balance sheet, property, plant and equipment of 10.1m and a similar increase in the finance lease creditor at 22 August 2004.
The fair values attached to operating head leasehold interests on acquisitions are deemed to represent lease premiums under IFRS and are carried as intangible assets.
This has resulted in a decrease in property, plant and equipment of 25.0m at 22 August 2004 and 29.7m at 20 August 2005 and an increase in intangible assets of 17.3m at 22 August 2004 and 21.9m at 20 August 2005.
Goodwill The Group has elected to restate previous business combinations under IFRS 3 resulting in a net increase in goodwill at 22 August 2004 of 130.2m 20 August 2005: 138.3m primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities on acquisition in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Deferred tax IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be calculated based on temporary differences, at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying value for financial reporting purposes.
Under UK GAAP it was not necessary to provide for deferred tax on capital gains that have been rolled over into replacement assets or arisen on revaluations.
Under IFRS potential liabilities are recognised even though it is highly unlikely that they will crystallise.
As a result the Group has provided an additional 217m of deferred tax liabilities at 22 August 2004 20 August 2005: 230m in its opening balance sheet that were not required under UK GAAP.
141m of these deferred tax liabilities have arisen through corporate acquisitions and, as a result of the Group electing to account for historical acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, this has mitigated the impact on net assets to 75.9m.
Deferred tax assets of 30.2m have been recognised on the fair value of loans and swaps at 22 August 2004 20 August 2005: 35.6m and 18m of deferred tax assets have been recognised at 22 August 2004 20 August 2005: 20m on the recognition of tax losses.
Trade and other payables IFRS does not permit unapproved dividends to be accrued at the year end.
Obligations under finance lease Obligations under finance leases have been recognised for those building head leases which have been reclassified as held under finance leases.
Retirement benefit obligations Under UK GAAP, scheme assets and liabilities are not recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
Under IFRS, any excess or deficit of scheme assets over scheme liabilities is recorded as an asset or liability, respectively, in the Groups balance sheet.
Each year, the scheme net assets or liabilities are adjusted for actuarial gains and losses which are recognised directly in reserves.
Retirement benefit obligations are separated out from pensions on the face of the balance sheet.
Balance sheet reclassifications Property, plant and equipment Under IFRS software is classified as an intangible asset.
Under IFRS, assets are classified as held for sale when their value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and management consider a sale to be highly probable.
Cash flow The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has no effect upon reported cash flows generated by the Group.
The IFRS cash flow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP with cash flows analysed into three categories of activities operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Adoption of IAS 39 The impact of adopting IAS 39 on 21 August 2005 was to reduce net assets by 68.6m.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 105 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 19 August 2006 36 Transition to IFRS continued Notes to the reconciliation of the comparative financial statements The adoption of IFRS has resulted in a number of changes to the Groups accounting policies in the following primary areas: Reclassification of assets, principally computer software and operating head leasehold interests as intangible assets: The cessation of amortisation of acquired goodwill: Restatement of property, plant and equipment at deemed cost: Reclassification of a small number of building head leases as finance leases: Recognition and disclosure of the Groups defined benefit pension obligations: The charging of long term employee incentive awards, principally share option costs, to income: Derecognition of proposed final dividends at the balance sheet date: Reclassification of assets held for resale: and Movements in the deferred tax liability relating to properties acquired from business combinations.
All changes in the accounting policies have been made in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRS 1 and each is explained in more detail on the Groups website at www.
