13 Intangible xed assets continued Other intangible assets Intangible assets do not include any internally generated assets.
Businesses acquired during the year relate to intangibles identied as part of the acquisitions of SRH, WGSN and DeHavilland.
These intangibles all have a nite life and are being amortised over their useful lives.
The intangible asset acquired in 2005 relates to a brand acquired with Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.
This brand has an indefinite life due to the strength of its recognition and is tested annually for impairment.
The intangible impairment charge of 14m 2005: 30m relates primarily to our healthcare titles, in particular, Nursing Times magazine, which are part of the Business-to-business segment.
Nursing Times has found current trading difficult and carrying value has been reduced to recoverable amount, determined at its market value.
During the year, the Group reviewed the appropriateness of the remaining useful economic lives for its intangible assets.
As a result, the Group shortened the remaining amortisation periods for print-based recruitment titles to reect the changing market conditions for these titles in their existing forms.
This resulted in additional amortisation during the year of 9m above the charge based on their original lives.
The useful economic lives for the Groups intangible assets now range from five to 20 years.
The Group is satisfied that the carrying value at 31 March 2006 of these titles remains recoverable in full.
Other relates to the clear down of cost and accumulated amortisation or impairment for assets with a net book value of nil which are no longer used.
