12 Subsidiary undertakings The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings, all of which are registered in England and Wales: The City of London European Trust Limited, City of London Investments Limited and The City of London Finance Company Limited.
The accounts of the three companies have not been consolidated because of the insignificant amounts involved.
Consequently the accounts present information about the Company as an individual entity and not about its Group.
The directors consider that the values of the subsidiary undertakings are not less than the amounts at which they are included in the accounts.
The dormant companies are maintained in order to protect the company names.
The City of London European Trust Limited was incorporated in 1899 as Patrick & McGregor, Limited and is dormant, not having traded since 1968.
The aggregate amount of the capital and reserves of the City of London European Trust Limited at 30 June 2006 was 347,000 2005: 347,000.
