The 4% preference capital of NV is redeemable at par at the companys option either wholly or in part.
The other classes of preferential share capital of NV are not redeemable.
At the Annual General Meeting of NV held on 8 May 2006 it was agreed to convert the nominal value of all classes of shares from guilders into euros.
The 7% and 6% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.
1 000 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of 428.57 each, and the 4% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.
100 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of 42.86 each.
The effect of this was to adjust their reported value, with the difference being held as a statutory reserve.
In order to maintain the same economic rights for the preference shares as before the euro conversion, it was decided that their entitlement to dividend and liquidation proceeds remains linked, using the ofcial euro conversion rate, to the amount in Dutch guilders originally paid up on these shares.
As a consequence the amount paid out as preference dividends will remain the same euro amount as paid out in previous years.
