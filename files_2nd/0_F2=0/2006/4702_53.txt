.......................................................................... 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles Diageo plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
From 1 July 2004, the group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
As a result of the transition to IFRS, the previously published reconciliations of net income and shareholders equity for the year ended 30 June 2005 have been amended to reflect the restated consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet reported under IFRS.
IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However, the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the group applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Under the IFRS transition provisions within the Securities and Exchange Commissions Form 20-F requirements, the group is permitted to provide two years of financial information under IFRS and reconciliations to US GAAP for the periods presented.
The differences between IFRS and US GAAP, in respect of net income and shareholders equity, are set out below: Effect on net income of differences between IFRS and US GAAP: 2006 2005 Notes million million Net income attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company in accordance with IFRS 1,908 1,344 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Inventories and land and buildings a 24 24 Intangibles b 6 2 Pensions and other post employment benefits c 96 6 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares d 27 Financial instruments e 31 46 Inter company balances f 1 14 Mot Hennessy g 7 16 Disposal of General Mills shares h 92 160 Disposal of businesses i 1 5 Burger King j 18 17 Employee share options k 2 9 Other items 3 29 Deferred taxation on above adjustments 53 36 other l 181 277 Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,429 1,470 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax k 2 Net income in accordance with US GAAP 1,427 1,470 Earnings per ordinary share in accordance with US GAAP m Basic earnings per ordinary share Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 50.3p 49.5p Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 0.1 p Net income 50.2p 49.5p Diluted earnings per ordinary share Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 50.1p 49.4p Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 0.1 p Net income 50.0p 49.4p Basic earnings per ADS after cumulative effect of accounting change 200.8p 198.0p Diluted earnings per ADS after cumulative effect of accounting change 200.0p 197.6p Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Cumulative effect on shareholders equity of differences between IFRS and US GAAP: 30 June 30 June 2006 2005 Notes million million Equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company in accordance with IFRS 4,502 4,459 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Inventories and land and buildings a 144 171 Brands a, b 3,084 3,081 Goodwill a, b 3,201 3,137 Other intangibles a, b 16 26 Pensions and other post employment benefits c 648 511 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares d 45 Financial instruments e 17 38 Mot Hennessy g 322 316 Investment in General Mills h 148 Burger King j 4 Employee share options k 8 Other items 14 15 Deferred taxation on above adjustments l 1,380 1,173 other l 990 819 Shareholders equity in accordance with US GAAP 9,508 9,853 A description of accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP that are material to the group is set out below.
a Accounting for the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the group has opted not to restate the accounting for business combinations that occurred prior to the date of transition from that previously applied under UK GAAP.
In the groups primary financial statements, the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group has therefore been accounted for under merger accounting principles pooling of interests, where the results, cash flows and balance sheets of both entities, having made adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, were aggregated with no adjustment to fair value.
Under US GAAP, the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet with an effective acquisition date of 31 December 1997.
Consequently the Guinness Groups assets and liabilities, including land and buildings, were recorded at fair values on 31 December 1997.
Under US GAAP, the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets has been allocated firstly to identifiable intangible assets, including brands, based on their fair values, with the remainder allocated to goodwill.
Fair value adjustments to the recorded amounts of inventories, net of deferred tax, are expensed in the period in which the inventory is sold.
b Brands, goodwill and other intangibles Under both IFRS and US GAAP, significant owned brands acquired by the group are recorded on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, the group has written off goodwill and other intangible assets acquired up to 30 June 1998 direct to reserves in the period when acquired.
All intangible assets acquired from 1 July 1998 have been capitalised in the balance sheet.
Capitalised goodwill and other intangibles, apart from brands, acquired between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 2004 were amortised over their useful economic lives, up to a maximum of 20 years.
From the date of transition to IFRS 1 July 2004, goodwill and brands are not amortised but are subject to impairment tests at least annually.
Under US GAAP, up to 30 June 2001, intangible assets have been capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised through the statement of income over their useful economic lives, not exceeding 40 years.
On 1 July 2001, the group adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and ceased to amortise goodwill from this date.
Instead goodwill has been subject to impairment tests at least annually, as under IFRS.
128 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... c Pensions and other post employment benefits There are a number of significant differences between IFRS and US GAAP in accounting for pension and other post employment benefit costs that have an impact on the group: i Under IFRS, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using the fair value of assets are charged credited to other finance income in the income statement.
The group has taken the option permitted under IFRS to include any amount arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the period and those at the end of the period, and any differences between the actual and expected returns on the plans assets, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost, the interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using a smoothed market value of assets are all charged credited to operating income.
The cumulative amounts arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the period and those at the end of the period, and any differences between the actual and expected returns on the plans assets, are amortised through operating income over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
As there is currently an unrecognised loss under US GAAP, this led to an additional charge to operating income for the year ended 30 June 2006 of 96 million 2005 26 million under US GAAP compared with IFRS.
ii The expected return on assets for the period is calculated using the fair bid value of assets under IFRS, but is calculated using a smoothed market value of assets under US GAAP.
This smoothing can lead to differences in the amount included in the statement of income from the expected return on investments in the pension funds.
For the year ended 30 June 2006, the income was 275 million 2005 280 million under IFRS, whereas it was 298 million 2005 347 million under US GAAP.
This amount is included in other finance income under IFRS, but in operating income under US GAAP.
iii Under IFRS, gains from curtailments are recognised immediately as a credit to the income statement, but under US GAAP, where unrecognised net losses exceed curtailment gains, the net loss is spread through the income statement over the average remaining service lives of the active members.
In addition under US GAAP, any unrecognised prior service cost in respect of members involved in the curtailment must be recognised immediately as a charge to operating income.
For the year ended 30 June 2006, this led to an additional charge to the income statement of 5 million 2005 40 million under US GAAP compared with IFRS.
iv There are some historic losses from past service costs that were not recognised immediately as a charge to operating income under US GAAP.
These losses are amortised over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
For the year ended 30 June 2006, this led to an additional charge to operating income of 15 million 2005 17 million under US GAAP compared with IFRS.
v Under IFRS, the surplus or deficit in post employment plans at the balance sheet date is reported as part of the groups consolidated net assets.
Under US GAAP, only when the plan is in deficit, calculated on the plans accrued rather than projected liabilities, is the liability included in the groups consolidated net assets.
If the plan is in surplus, the groups consolidated net assets include a prepayment or provision which is the difference between the cumulative charges to operating income and the cumulative cash contributions made to the plan.
d Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares Under IFRS prior to 30 June 2005, the premium received from the sale to General Mills of options over 29 million ordinary shares of Diageos holding in that company was deferred in the balance sheet pending exercise or lapse of the options.
On 4 October 2004, 4 million of the shares over which the options were exercisable were disposed of to the groups UK pension fund.
The premium in respect of the option over the 4 million shares was realised in the statement of income in the year ended 30 June 2005.
Under US GAAP, the option contracts represented derivatives and, accordingly, were held at their estimated fair values at the balance sheet dates, with changes in fair value included in the statement of income.
From 1 July 2005, following the adoption of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, under both IFRS and US GAAP, any changes in fair value of the options have been included in the statement of income.
The options over the remaining 25 million ordinary shares expired in October 2005 and resulted in a gain of 8 million under both IFRS and US GAAP.
e Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Under IFRS, prior to the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 July 2005, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and derivatives hedging forecast transactions were not recognised until realised.
Since 1 July 2005, all such derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, prior to 1 July 2005, for derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations in respect of foreign exchange differences arising on translation to closing rates, changes in their fair value were taken to the statement of recognised income and expense.
Under US GAAP, all derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Certain of the groups derivatives qualified for and are designated as hedges under US GAAP.
Gains and losses that arose from changes in the fair value of derivatives, and gains and losses that arose from changes in the fair value of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, were charged or credited in determining net income under US GAAP.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 129 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued From 1 July 2005, there are differences between IFRS and US GAAP in respect of interest rate hedging, cash flow hedging and net investment hedging.
For interest rate hedging, there are differences between hedge documentation, effectiveness testing methods and transition requirements which result in: i some derivatives not being designated as hedges under US GAAP: ii a lower level of ineffectiveness arising on those derivatives which can be designated as hedges under US GAAP: and iii an adjustment being made to the hedged item for fair value hedges at transition to IAS 39 which is not made under US GAAP.
For cash flow hedging, at transition to IAS 39 all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are considered as hedges prior to the transition date, while for US GAAP the hedge relationship starts from the time the hedge is documented, which in certain cases is the date that IAS 39 was first adopted.
Therefore there are differences with respect to the amounts recognised in the hedging reserves and the amount recycled to the income statement at the time the hedged item matures.
For net investment hedging, there are differences between hedge designation and effectiveness testing requirements, as a result of which some loans and derivatives cannot be designated as hedges under US GAAP.
f Inter company balances Under IFRS and US GAAP, exchange differences arising on long term inter company balances, for which settlement is not planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, are generally included as equity movements.
However, under US GAAP there is a restriction whereby one of the companies with the inter company balance must have the same functional currency as the common parent company, and there must be no intermediate parent company with a different functional currency.
Otherwise any exchange differences arising are taken to net income.
g Mot Hennessy The operations of Mot Hennessy are conducted both through a partnership and through a limited company in which the group has 34% interests.
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the investments in Mot Hennessy are accounted for using the equity method of accounting but, as a result of applying accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP, primarily in respect of accounting for the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group referred to in a above, the groups share of the carrying values of the investments are different under IFRS and US GAAP.
The groups share of net income from Mot Hennessy is different between IFRS and US GAAP primarily in respect of accounting differences on fair value accounting for vines and grapes and post employment benefits.
h Disposal of General Mills shares Applying the accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP resulted in different carrying values for the shares held in General Mills.
As a consequence of these different values, a different gain or loss arose on the subsequent disposals of the shares in October 2004 and November 2005.
Under IFRS, the investment in General Mills was classified as a non-current investment for the year ended 30 June 2005 at deemed cost and, on the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 July 2005, was reclassified as an available for sale security.
Under US GAAP, the investment was held from 1 July 2004 as an available for sale security.
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, available for sale securities are held on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value included in equity.
On the disposal of the shares in General Mills, the amount included in equity in respect of the shares disposed of, representing the cumulative change in fair value, was included in net income.
i Disposal of businesses Applying the accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP can result in changes to the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities.
As a consequence of these different carrying values, including related tax balances, different gains or losses may arise on the subsequent disposal of the assets.
In addition, the timing of the recognition of a loss on a disposal may be different under IFRS and US GAAP.
j Burger King Under IFRS, the sale of Burger King on 13 December 2002 the completion date was accounted for as a disposal in the year ended 30 June 2003, and interest receivable on the subordinated debt was included in interest income in the period to which it related.
Under US GAAP, the transaction was not accounted for as a disposal in the year ended 30 June 2003 due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continued involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance.
Under US GAAP, following the completion date, Diageo did not recognise profits of Burger King, nor interest receivable on the subordinated debt due from Burger King, in its income statement but, generally, reflected losses as an impairment charge against the assets retained in the balance sheet.
On 13 July 2005, Burger King refinanced its external borrowings on a stand-alone basis, resulting in the release of Diageo from its obligations under the guarantee and the receipt by Diageo of amounts owed in respect of the subordinated debt and cumulative interest.
As a consequence, under US GAAP, Burger King has been accounted for as a disposal in the year ended 30 June 2006 and the cumulative deferred interest and cumulative translation adjustment in respect of Burger King have been recognised in the income statement.
k Employee share options From 1 July 2005, Diageo adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
123 R Share-Based Payment for its US GAAP reporting.
As a consequence, for the year ended 30 June 2006, the accounting treatment for equity classified employee stock options was the same under both IFRS and US GAAP.
US GAAP has more stringent criteria than IFRS for determining whether a plan is classified as an equity or liability plan.
Liability classified awards are re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled, whereas equity classified awards are measured at grant date fair value and are not subsequently re-measured.
Diageos senior executive share option plan SESOP is accounted for as a liability plan under US GAAP, whereas under IFRS it is treated as an equity plan.
On adoption of SFAS 123 R, Diageo revalued unvested awards in the SESOP plan and recognised a cumulative effect of an accounting change of 2 million net of tax.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees which differs in certain respects from IFRS.
Under APB 25, compensation cost for fixed awards being awards under which both the exercise price and the number of shares are fixed is determined as the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of the award and the amount the employee has to pay for the shares.
Compensation cost for variable awards including awards subject to future performance conditions is measured as the difference between the market price at the period end and the exercise price and is based on the number of awards expected to vest.
l Deferred taxation IFRS requires deferred tax to be recognised, with limited exceptions, in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax written down value of assets and liabilities and the book value, including temporary differences arising as a result of intra group transactions.
Similarly US GAAP requires deferred tax to be recognised, with limited exceptions, for taxable temporary differences but, where assets or liabilities are transferred within a group, no deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of changes in tax written down values.
IFRS and US GAAP require deferred tax liabilities to be set up for all assets separately identified, where there are temporary differences, including brands, but excluding goodwill not deductible for tax, recognised on a business combination.
As the combination of GrandMet and the Guinness Group was accounted for as a merger under IFRS but as an acquisition under US GAAP, as referred to in a above, deferred tax liabilities arose in respect of the additional acquired brand values.
Other differences exist between IFRS and US GAAP, including differences in respect of share options and profit on the intra group sale of inventories.
IFRS requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be disclosed as non-current items on the balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified between current and non-current depending on the items to which they relate.
m Earnings per ordinary share Under IFRS and US GAAP, the calculation of earnings per ordinary share is generally consistent and is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Earnings per American Depositary Share are calculated on the basis of one American Depositary Share representing four ordinary shares.
n Variable interest entities Following the implementation of FIN 46 R by Diageo for the year ended 30 June 2005, US GAAP requires the results, assets and liabilities of variable interest entities to be consolidated if the group is regarded as the primary beneficiary.
The group has a number of joint arrangements with Mot Hennessy in France and the Far East, involved in the marketing and distribution of the groups and Mot Hennessys premium drinks, which fall within the scope of the Interpretation and have been consolidated.
Under IFRS, the group only consolidates the attributable share of the results, assets and liabilities of the joint arrangements measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
For the year ended 30 June 2006, the consolidation of variable interest entities under US GAAP increased sales by 437 million 2005 303 million and operating income by 38 million 2005 25 million as compared with IFRS.
Compliance with FIN 46 R had no effect on US GAAP net income or shareholders equity.
o Basis of consolidation The group has interests in a number of other jointly controlled entities.
Under IFRS, the group reports its interest in jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation.
The groups share of the assets, liabilities, sales, income and cash flows of jointly controlled entities are included in the appropriate categories of the groups financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Under US GAAP, these interests are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the groups share of the net income and net assets of the jointly controlled entities are reported as one line in the income statement and balance sheet.
Applying the equity method of accounting under US GAAP for the year ended 30 June 2006 decreased sales by 110 million 2005 142 million and operating income by 19 million 2005 18 million as compared with IFRS.
This difference has no effect on US GAAP net income or shareholders equity.
p Discontinued operations Under IFRS, the original disposals of Burger King and Pillsbury met the conditions for separate disclosure as discontinued operations.
Under US GAAP, due to Diageos continuing involvement in Burger King at the date of disposal through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance, and in Pillsbury due to the shareholding in General Mills, these disposals did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.
In the year ended 30 June 2005, the group released a provision of 53 million in respect of the disposal of Burger King, and in the year ended 30 June 2006, the group disposed of its final investment holding in General Mills.
Under IFRS, the disposal of Burger King and the release of tax provisions on the original disposal of Pillsbury have been classified in discontinued operations, consistent with the accounting for the original disposals.
Under US GAAP, these transactions have been included in continuing operations.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 131 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued US GAAP statements of income for the two years ended 30 June 2006 are set out below: 2006 2005 million million Sales 10,031 9,170 Excise duties 2,431 2,272 Net sales 7,600 6,898 Cost of sales 3,248 2,834 Gross profit 4,352 4,064 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,408 2,235 Seagram integration 30 Thalidomide provision 121 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares 30 27 Burger King 21 53 Disposal of other businesses 2 2 Other operating income 5 12 Operating income 1,942 1,768 Disposal of General Mills shares 89 61 Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates net of tax 177 150 Investment income 5 17 Interest expense and other finance charges 263 205 Interest income and other finance income 23 60 Income before income taxes 1,973 1,851 Income taxes 462 313 Minority interest charges 82 68 Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,429 1,470 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 2 Net income after cumulative effect of accounting change 1,427 1,470 Excise duties comprise 468 million 2005 417 million of duties charged as tax on sales and 1,963 million 2005 1,855 million of duties charged as production and importation taxes.
Research and development expenditure was written off to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period in which it was incurred.

An analysis of US GAAP deferred tax included in the US GAAP summary consolidated balance sheet is as follows: 2006 2005 million million Current assets 30 196 Other long term assets 37 28 Other current liabilities 6 52 Other long term liabilities 1,986 1,896 US GAAP cash flows The groups consolidated financial statements include a consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 Cash flow statements.
The objective and principles of IAS 7 are similar to those set out in the US accounting standard SFAS No.
However, under IAS 7, cash for the purposes of the cash flow statement includes bank overdrafts.
Under US GAAP, bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings and the movements thereon are included in financing activities.
In addition, the accounting for variable interest rate entities and jointly controlled entities differs between IFRS and US GAAP, which changes the amounts included as cash and cash equivalents.
Calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
95, cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2006 and 2005 were as follows: 2006 2005 million million Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated cash flow statement in accordance with IFRS 651 729 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Bank overdrafts 48 58 Variable interest entities 33 26 Jointly controlled entities 23 21 Cash and cash equivalents in accordance with US GAAP 709 792 Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 133 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Statement of comprehensive income under US GAAP Under IFRS, the group presents a consolidated statement of recognised income and expense which is similar to a statement of comprehensive income required by US GAAP.

142 and ceased to amortise goodwill from this date.
The standard directs that goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment rather than being subject to amortisation.
The group conducts annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the level of the reporting units which make up each operating segment.
Potential impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair value.
Fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology and estimates regarding future growth.
These cash flows are discounted at the rate estimated by management to be the weighted average cost of capital for each particular reporting unit.
The estimates are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of the long term planning process.

The group cannot determine the impact of the adoption of SFAS No.
154 as it depends in part upon future changes to US accounting principles.
155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statement Nos.
133 and 140 In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
This statement provides a fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation, and requires that beneficial interests in securitised financial assets be analysed to determine whether they are free standing derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation.
155 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 September 2006.
155 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.

FIN 48 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 December 2006.
The group is currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 on the results and net assets of the group.

It is effective for new arrangements entered into, and modifications or renewals of existing arrangements beginning, in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after 15 March 2006.
The application of EITF 04-13 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.

FSP FIN 46 R -6 Determining the Variability to be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No.
46 R In April 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FIN 46 R -6.
This position addresses how a reporting enterprise should determine the variability to be considered in applying FASB Interpretation No.
46 revised December 2003 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.
The variability that is considered in applying FIN 46 R affects the determination of: a whether the entity is a variable interest entity VIE : b which interests are variable interests in the entity: and c which party, if any, is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
That variability will affect any calculation of expected losses and expected residual returns, if such a calculation is necessary.
It is effective for all entities including newly created entities with which that enterprise first becomes involved, and to all entities previously required to be analysed under FIN 46 R when a reconsideration event has occurred, starting from the first day of the first reporting period beginning after 15 June 2006.
It is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB including the Emerging Issues Task Force, the AICPA and the SEC are not believed by management to have a material impact on Diageos present or future consolidated financial statements.
Employee share compensation For the year ended 30 June 2005, the group complied with APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
From 1 July 2005, the group adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
123 R Share-Based Payment using the modified prospective transition method.
Under this method, compensation expense, determined using the fair value of the underlying option or share, is charged to the income statement for new grants made in the year ended 30 June 2006 and any unvested grants made in prior years.
Compensation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the share option or grant.
For the year ended 30 June 2006, this resulted in a charge of 23 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses and 5 million in cost of goods sold.
In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the US GAAP financial information for prior periods has not been restated.
At 30 June 2006, there was 34 million of unrecognised compensation cost in respect of non vested share-based compensation granted under the various share option and share award plans.
The cost is expected to be recognised over a weighted average period of two years.
The cash received from the exercise of options for the year ended 30 June 2006 was 69 million 2005 69 million.
All share option schemes, with the exception of SESOP, are equity-classified awards under SFAS No.
123 R. SESOP is a liability-classified award which is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award vests.
If the group had elected to recognise compensation expense based upon SFAS No.
123 in prior years, the net income and basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share for the year ended 30 June 2005 would have been the pro forma amounts set out below: 2005 million Net income As reported under US GAAP 1,470 Stock-based compensation, net of related tax effects, included in the determination of net income as reported 17 Stock-based employee compensation expense, under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 26 Pro forma net income 1,461 Basic earnings per ordinary share As reported under US GAAP 49.5p Pro forma basic earnings per ordinary share 49.2p Diluted earnings per ordinary share As reported under US GAAP 49.4p Pro forma diluted earnings per ordinary share 49.1p These pro forma amounts may not be representative as they are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of judgement, and therefore cannot be determined precisely.
Changes in assumptions could affect the estimates.
Pension plans The group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The plans generally are of the defined benefit type.
The significant plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and Canada.
The principal plans are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The measurement dates used to calculate the figures in the US GAAP financial information are the appropriate balance sheet dates.
The total periodic charge for the groups pension plans, calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
87, was as follows: 2006 2005 million million Service cost 103 96 Interest cost 245 264 Expected return on assets 297 347 Amortisation of: Unrecognised prior service cost 15 16 Unrecognised net loss 94 27 Terminations, curtailments and settlements 3 22 Net periodic pension charge 163 78 Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 137 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 35 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued The funded status of the groups pension plans under US GAAP was as follows: 2006 2005 million million Projected benefit obligations at beginning of the year 5,297 4,607 Exchange differences 10 16 Reclassification to other postretirement plans 24 Acquisition of businesses 9 Other plans not previously disclosed 117 Service cost 103 96 Interest cost 245 264 Actuarial gain loss 157 424 Employee contributions 11 11 Benefits and expenses paid 243 232 Curtailments and settlements 9 Special termination settlements 1 2 Plan amendments 1 Projected benefit obligations at end of the year 5,252 5,297 Plan assets at fair value at beginning of the year 4,142 3,663 Exchange differences 6 16 Reclassification to other postretirement plans 3 Acquisition of businesses 6 Other plans not previously disclosed 68 Actual return on plan assets 584 478 Contributions by the group 97 138 Employee contributions 11 11 Benefits and expenses paid 243 232 Plan assets at fair value at end of the year 4,600 4,142 Excess of benefit obligations over plan assets 652 1,155 Unrecognised prior service cost 59 74 Unrecognised net loss 1,224 1,761 631 680 The amounts recognised in the US GAAP summary consolidated balance sheet were as follows: 2006 2005 million million Pension prepayment 284 57 Accrued benefit liabilities 400 823 Intangible asset 62 78 Accumulated other comprehensive income 685 1,368 631 680 The total accumulated benefit obligation at 30 June 2006 was 4,874 million 2005 4,877 million.
There are a number of pension plans where the plan assets are less than the accumulated benefit obligations at 30 June 2006.
With respect to these plans, the aggregated projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets were 4,093 million, 3,855 million and 3,464 million, respectively 2005 5,180 million, 4,781 million and 3,984 million, respectively.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the groups pension plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the net periodic costs for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June: US plans Non-US plans 2006 2005 2006 2005 % % % % Rate of general increase in salaries 3.4 3.0 3.9 3.9 Discount rate for plan liabilities 6.3 5.0 5.1 4.7 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets 7.4 6.5 7.3 6.9 For the UK and US plans, there are, in addition to the above percentages, age related promotional salary increases.
Contributions are made by the group, on actuarial advice, to provide assets sufficient to cover the benefit entitlements of plan participants.
Generally, benefits are based on a formula recognising length of service and earnings close to retirement.
Postretirement benefits other than pensions The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with postretirement insurance.
The plans are generally unfunded.
The liability in respect of these benefits is assessed by qualified independent actuaries under the projected unit method and is included in other long term liabilities.
The postretirement medical and life insurance costs and accrued postretirement benefits of the plans, calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
106, were as follows: 2006 2005 million million Service cost 4 1 Interest cost 6 4 Unrecognised net losses 2 Postretirement charge 12 5 Projected benefit obligations at beginning of the year 93 66 Exchange differences 3 2 Reclassification from other postretirement plans 3 Other plans not previously disclosed 5 Service cost 4 1 Interest cost 6 4 Actuarial loss 2 19 Plan amendments 1 Benefits and expenses paid 4 4 Projected benefit obligations at end of the year 102 93 Plan assets at fair value at beginning of the year 2 2 Contributions by the group 4 4 Benefits and expenses paid 4 4 Plan assets at fair value at end of the year 2 2 Excess of benefit obligations over plan assets 100 91 Unrecognised prior service cost 4 3 Unrecognised net loss 26 22 Accrued postretirement benefits at end of the year 70 66 The weighted average discount rate used for determining the obligations of postretirement medical plans in the United States is 6.3% 2005 5.0%.
The weighted average medical inflation for beneficiaries is 9% reducing by 1% per year to 5% 2005 10% reducing by 1% per year to 5%.
