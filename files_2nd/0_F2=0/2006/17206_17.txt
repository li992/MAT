Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs which are identified according to geographical segment as follows: 2006 2005 m m UK & Ireland 22.1 22.1 Continental Europe 30.4 18.8 52.5 40.9 Included in the Continental Europe goodwill in the above table is 11.3m in respect of Premium Logistics which, as it was acquired in the year, is still capable of separate testing for impairment.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations are cash flow projections based on the financial budgets and, in respect of Premium, forecasts approved by the Board for the forthcoming financial year and beyond.
Cash flows beyond those 12- and 36- month periods are extrapolated over a further 19 or 17 years respectively using the estimated growth rates and underlying inflation rates stated below, which do not exceed the long-term average growth and inflation rates in the specific geographical areas where the CGU operates.
A 20-year cash flow projection period is viewed as appropriate when considering the value in use of goodwill.

The provisions for leasehold liabilities are determined by management as the best estimate of the expected costs of empty and under-utilised properties and are utilised over the relevant lease terms.
The restructuring provisions are similarly determined and are expected to be utilised in the current financial year.
The Group holds 100% of the share capital of a captive insurer whose functions are to both insure and reinsure certain of the risks of the Group.
The insurance provisions in the above table are held in respect of outstanding insurance claims, the majority of which are expected to be paid within two to six years.
The discount unwinding arises on the employers liability policy which is discounted over a period of seven years at a rate based on the Bank of England base rate.
The assets of the captive insurer consist of cash deposits held with various banks, typically on three month fixed interest deposits, see note 28.
Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 49 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Acquisitions Current year acquisitions On 7 October 2005 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Premium Logistics now renamed Wincanton S. A. S. for 20.3m in cash.
The acquired company provides contract logistics services in France and in the six months since acquisition contributed 1.2m of operating profit.
If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of the year it is estimated that the totals of Group underlying operating profit and revenue would have been approximately 43m and 1,848m respectively.
The acquisition has given rise to a value of goodwill of 11.3m, being the difference between the cash consideration paid and the net assets acquired at fair value.
The acquired net assets at acquisition are summarised in the table below: Acquirees Fair value Acquisition book value adjustments amounts m m m Intangible assets 10.4 10.4 Property, plant and equipment 8.9 1.4 7.5 Deferred tax assets 0.3 2.7 3.0 Inventories 0.3 0.3 Trade and other receivables 23.5 23.5 Cash and cash equivalents 4.5 4.5 Income tax payable 0.2 0.2 Borrowings 6.6 6.6 Trade and other payables 20.9 20.9 Employee benefits 2.0 2.0 Provisions 0.4 6.6 7.0 Deferred tax liabilities 3.5 3.5 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 7.4 1.6 9.0 Goodwill on acquisition 11.3 Consideration payable including expenses of 1.2m 20.3 Net debt acquired 2.1 Net cash outflow 22.4 The fair value adjustments above are required to align the accounting policies of the acquired business with those of the Group.
These adjustments can, if necessary, be amended for up to 12 months following acquisition.
Goodwill of 11.3m has arisen on the acquisition reflecting the strategic importance of broadening Wincantons business base in France and achieving national coverage in that important logistics market, the value of the management and workforce and some of the expected synergies to be gained as the acquired entity is fully integrated into the Group.
Following the acquisition of a 26.0 per cent interest in PSL Trans European Spedition und Logistik GmbH PSL in December 2002, the Group increased its shareholding by 74.0 per cent in April 2005 for consideration of 0.1m, resulting in an increase in goodwill of 0.6m note 9.

In addition certain employment contracts of employees in the Group give rise to holiday pay obligations which are deferred at the accounting year end due to the relative timing of the annual holiday year.
These two elements are analysed in the table below and the pension arrangements discussed in detail: 2006 2005 m m Holiday pay 5.9 4.6 Pension plans see below 146.4 98.4 152.3 103.0 These employee benefits are split as follows Current 7.5 4.6 Non-current 144.8 98.4 152.3 103.0 Pension schemes Employees of Wincanton plc participated in funded and unfunded pension arrangements in the UK and Ireland and elsewhere in Europe during the year ended 31 March 2006, details of these are given below.
The principal Wincanton Scheme in the UK has three defined benefit sections, plus a defined contribution section called the Wincanton Retirement Savings Section.
The employees of Wincanton Ireland Limited are eligible to participate in a separate defined contribution scheme.
Assets of these pension arrangements are held in separate trust funds independent of Wincanton.
Additionally a small number of senior employees, who are subject to the statutory earnings cap on pensionable earnings, are entitled to participate in an unfunded unapproved arrangement, which generally replicates the benefits that would otherwise be payable from the Scheme had they not been subject to the earnings cap.
The pension cost in relation to the defined benefit sections of the Wincanton Scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
52 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The latest formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2005 by Hymans Robertson and as a result, the Group in consultation with the pension fund trustees and Scheme actuary has agreed a series of measures to address both the actuarial past service deficit and the level of future service cost of the Groups defined benefit scheme.
The measures in respect of the cost of future service accrual remain subject to consultation with employees.
An incremental cash contribution of 40m approximately 28m net of corporation tax has been made in two instalments, one before the end of the financial year and the second early in the new financial year.
Following the up-front contribution, the actuarial past service deficit, which has increased primarily as a consequence of increased longevity assumptions, will be approximately 70m approximately 49m net of deferred tax.
The past service deficit will be further addressed through an increase in incremental cash contributions, with effect from April 2006, from 2m per annum currently to 8m per annum.
Lastly Company contributions were increased from 13.6% to 14.6% of pensionable salaries for the main category of employee with effect from 1 April 2006.
Different rates apply for other smaller employee categories.
In addition, contributions are made to a number of smaller pension arrangements for employees elsewhere in Europe and Wincanton has assumed liability for certain historic unfunded pension obligations of the German business which closed to future service in the 1980s.
The pension charge in respect of this arrangement represents interest on the unfunded obligations.
Following the acquisitions of Premium Logistics and PSL see note 22, Wincanton assumed liability for their pension obligations.
A provision of 0.8m is included in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2006, which represents the present value of the expected future payments due.
Pension scheme deficit The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes of the Group are calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits and are set out in the table below.
The calculations under IAS 19 are based on actuarial assumptions which are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible assumptions about the longterm future which, unless by chance, will not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain.
