1 Underlying results exclude goodwill amortisation and separately disclosed items.
This presentation is used to provide a normalised picture of the Groups earnings, making year-on-year comparisons more valid.
The main adjustments required to align these results with IFRS would be the inclusion of share-based payments and accounting for defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19.
The inclusion of share-based payments would increase expenses and hence reduce operating profit, while accounting for defined benefit pension schemes would reduce net assets by the scheme deficit.
Amortisation would not have been charged on goodwill therefore increasing profit after tax and increasing net assets whist dividends would not have been recognised until approved by the Board thereby increasing net assets.
