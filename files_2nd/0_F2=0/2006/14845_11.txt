10 RETURN OF SURPLUS FUNDS On 8 August 2005 the Company announced that it intended returning 250p per existing ordinary share to shareholders in conjunction with a reorganisation of the Companys share capital.
This return was structured to give shareholders a choice between receiving funds in the form of capital or income.
The return of surplus funds was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 8 September 2005.
Shareholders holding 32,709,363 ordinary shares elected, or were deemed to have elected, for A shares, which entitled the holders of those shares to a 250p dividend per share and, accordingly, on 16 September 2005, a total dividend of 81.8m was paid.
Shareholders holding 98,060,487 ordinary shares elected to receive B shares.
B shareholders were entitled to have the B shares repurchased for 250p each, or to retain them.
95,637,695 B shares were then repurchased pursuant to which payments totalling 239.1m were made.
The remaining B shares were repurchased for 254.2p each including 4.2p of accrued interest on 28 April 2006, with payments totalling 6.2m.
Following the approval of the return of surplus funds on 8 September 2005 a share reorganisation was effected.
Shareholders received eight new ordinary shares for every 15 ordinary shares held prior to the reorganisation.
As a result, 69,743,920 new ordinary shares were issued and 130,769,850 ordinary shares were cancelled.

The goodwill additions in the year to 31 May 2005 included 0.1m and 1.2m in respect of acquisitions of a further interest of 2.86% in Bolus d. o. o. and a 50% interest in Maxims Casino, London.
The goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration and fair value of the Groups share of net assets acquired.
Neither acquisition had any signi cant fair value adjustments.
Transfers to assets held for disposal represents the disposal on 10 March 2006 of the Groups interest in Coastbright Limited, a subsidiary of the Genting Group, which operates Maxims Casino in London.
Licences comprise the cost of acquired gaming licences.
These are not amortised as they are considered to have an inde nite life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the licences are expected to generate cash in ows.
Other acquired intangible assets in the prior year represents an option to purchase land at Elland Road, Leeds.
The fair value of the consideration was paid to purchase all the issued share capital of Stanley Genting Casinos Leeds Limited, whose only asset was this option.
During the prior year this company was transferred from the Group into a joint venture with Genting Group.
For further details, see note 13.
11A IMPAIRMENT REVIEW Impairment review of intangible assets with inde nite lives Assets that have an inde nite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The Group classi es goodwill and gaming licences as inde nite life assets.
Each casino is treated as a separate cash generating unit CGU and tested for impairment on this basis.
The inherent value of casino licences is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of the casinos and is therefore considered as part of total casino assets in the impairment review.
The cost of casino licences is 245.0m and management does not believe that there has been any impairment.
The recoverable amount of each casino, including the licence, is determined based on value in use calculations using cash ow projections.
The cash ow projections are based on current financial budgets approved by Directors for the next financial year.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to these projections is 9.8%.
For all casinos, the value in use calculation exceeded the carrying value and there was no impairment.
No reasonably possible change in a key assumption would cause the carrying value of the CGUs to be in excess of their value in use.

22 PENSION COMMITMENTS There are three principal pension schemes, the assets of which are held seperately from those of the Group.
fide ned contribution schemes Two of the schemes are fide ned contribution.
Group 2006 2005 m m Pension costs for fide ned contribution schemes are as follows: fide ned contribution schemes 1.1 1.6 fide ned bene t scheme The third scheme, the Stanley Leisure 1988 Retirement Bene t Scheme is a fide ned bene t scheme, which provides bene ts based on final pensionable earnings.
Membership has not been offered since 2 Feburary 2001, and the scheme is, therefore, effectively closed to new entrants.
This has not affected the status or rights of existing members.
The last full actuarial valuation was carried out by a quali ed independent actuary as at 1 Feburary 2004 and updated on an approximate basis to 30 April 2006.
The current contribution rate of 6.9% of pensionable pay plus 0.2m was to continue until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the scheme due as at 1 Feburary 2007.
However, following a payment of 4.8m into the scheme on 21 June 2005, the additional contribution of 0.2m per annum is no longer deemed necessary.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
All actuarial gains and losses in the year are recognised immediately in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

Stanley Leisure plc 2006 Annual Report and Accounts 69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 33 EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE On 19 June 2006, the Group acquired Harbour House Casino Limited, which owns the Harbour House Casino in Southampton, for a total consideration of 5.9m.
On 26 June 2006 we announced that we were in discussions with the Board of London Clubs International plc LCI concerning the possibility of a merger of Stanley and LCI.
Discussions are ongoing and there is no certainty that they will lead to a transaction.
34 EXPLANATION OF THE TRANSITION TO IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its accounts under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The accounts for the year ended 1 May 2005 were reported under UK GAAP.
The date of transition to IFRS was 3 May 2004.
The transition to IFRS had no signi cant impact on the Groups cash ow.
Further details of the transition to IFRS are included on our website www.
The adoption of IFRS has resulted in a number of adjustments of which the most material are: Intangible Assets IAS 38 and Property, Plant and Equipment IAS 16 The area of greatest impact of conversion to IFRS for the Group was in respect of xed asset licence values.
The Group had historically held properties in the Balance Sheet at their trading potential including the bene t of casino and betting of ce licences.
IAS 38 requires licences to be valued at cost rather than at valuation, and thus any revaluation gain since acquisition was reversed.
Furthermore, in accordance with both IAS 38 and IAS 16 the Group is now required to disclose the licence values within intangible assets, separately to the values of the properties to which they relate.
The effect on continuing operations at 1 May 2005 was to increase intangible assets by 222.6m, to reduce the net book value of property by 384.7m to the deemed cost as at 3 May 2004, and to reduce the assets classi ed as held for sale by 119.0m.
The revaluation reserve was reduced with a corresponding adjustment of 281.1m.
The useful economic lives of these assets have remained unchanged under IFRS and the above adjustments had no impact on the net pro t for the year to 1 May 2005.
Dividends Under IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date, proposed dividends must not be provided for at the Balance Sheet date unless shareholders have approved their distribution.
This means that, under IFRS, accounting for dividends is effectively on a cash paid basis, whereas under UK GAAP, proposed dividends were recorded as a liability when declared.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
The effect of this change was to increase net assets at 1 May 2005 by 9.7m.
Deferred Tax A deferred tax liability has been provided on the difference in cost for accounting purposes and the tax base, of the Groups casino licences 70.2m at 3 May 2004 and 1 May 2005, and the Groups casino properties 15.6m at 3 May 2004 and 1 May 2005.
Normally the recognition of such a deferred tax liability arising from a business combination would result in a corresponding increase in goodwill.
However under the exemption applied within FRS 1 relating to the restatement of business combinations, the Group is not permitted to adjust the carrying value of goodwill prior to the transaction date.
A deferred tax liability of 11.6m as at 3 May 2004 and 1 May 2005 has also been provided in respect of the revaluation reserve.
A deferred tax liability of 0.4m at 3 May 2004 and a deferred tax asset of 0.6m at 1 May 2005 has been provided in respect of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments.
Revenue and Cost of Sales Under IFRS betting revenue represents stakes less payouts.
This is different from UK GAAP where betting revenue represented total amounts staked by customers.
