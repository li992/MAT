These activities are carried out from business centres located in both the UK and Continental Europe.
The groups internal management structure and financial reporting systems treat the UK and Continental Europe as two separate segments because of the difference in reward arising from these two markets and this forms the basis for the geographical presentation of the primary segment information given below.
Unallocated assets comprise deferred tax assets and assets held for resale.
Unallocated liabilities comprise income tax, deferred tax liabilities and employee benefits.
Management has access to information that provides details on sales and gross margin by principal product group and across the five principal business sectors which comprise Regional multi-product, National multi-product, Regional commercial, Residential specialist and Commercial specialist.
However, this information is not provided as a secondary segment since the groups operations are not managed by reference to these sub classifications and the presentation would require an arbitrary allocation of overheads, assets and liabilities undermining the presentations validity and usefulness.

Accordingly, it is not possible to separately test each individual cash-generating unit for goodwill impairment.
Goodwill by geographical segments has been separately identified and measured for impairment.
The recoverable amount of each cashgenerating unit has been assessed on a value in use basis using the operating profit of each geographical segment for 2006 and extrapolating forward assuming forecast inflationary growth rates of 3% for the territories in which the cash-generating units are located.
The group has applied a discount rate of 9.1% when measuring for impairment.

The Headlam Group plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme is the principal defined benefit plan which provides benefits to group employees that have been admitted into the scheme.
The scheme is self-administered and its assets are held independently of the companys finances.
The scheme is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the company at rates advised by professionally qualified actuaries.
The latest actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2005 using the projected unit method.
The main annual rate assumptions used by the actuary were, increase in salaries 4.5%, increase of pensions in payment 2.5%, discount rate before retirement 6.7%, discount rate after retirement 4.7% and inflation 2.5%.
Assets were taken at their audited market value at the valuation date.
The total group cost of operating the plans during the year was 3,075,000 2005: 2,951,000 and, at 31 December 2006, there was an amount of 319,000 2005: 156,000 owed to the plans and included in creditors, being employer and employee contributions due for December 2006 but not received by 31 December 2006.
Included within the total group cost are costs relating to the groups defined contribution plans.
The pension cost for the year represents contributions payable by the group to the plans and amounted to 1,307,000 2005: 1,307,000.
Contributions amounting to 88,000 2005: 76,000 were payable to the scheme at 31 December 2006.
In the UK there is no contractual agreement or stated group policy for allocating the net defined benefit liability between the participating subsidiaries and as such the full deficit is recognised by the company, which is the sponsoring employer.
The participating subsidiary companies have recognised a cost equal to contributions payable for the period as advised by a professionally qualified actuary.
The company recognises a cost equal to its contributions payable for the period net of amounts recharged in relation to the group deficit to the participating subsidiary companies.

Options granted under the 1998 unapproved scheme are normally exercisable between the third and seventh anniversaries of their date of grant, and depending on the value of the grant, are subject to the movement of the groups basic earnings per share exceeding RPI between 3% and 5% per annum over the relevant period.
Additionally, the company operates a savings related share option scheme sharesave scheme which is open to employees subject to eligibility criteria determined by the directors prior to each option grant.
The first grant under the current scheme was made on 28 October 2002 where employees with over one years service were invited to participate.
As this sharesave scheme was granted before 7 November 2002, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.

23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The main risks arising in the normal course of the groups business are credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
Derivative transactions relate to forward currency contracts used to manage the currency risks from the groups selling and buying activities.
Credit risk The group and company have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all new customers requiring credit cover over a certain amount and these are frequently reviewed by management to limit exposure.
The group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Interest rate risk The group and company are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and cash deposits.
It borrows principally in sterling, euros and Swiss francs at both fixed and floating rates and places cash on deposit in sterling and euros at floating rates.
During the year, the group maintained its policy of borrowing at floating rates.

They are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates arising from transaction currency cash flows and the translation of the results and net assets of overseas subsidiary operations.
These exposures, however, have not had a significant effect on the results and financial position of the group overall.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the euro and Swiss franc.
The group and company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactional risk.
A future foreign currency contract would be entered into where there was a known requirement for the currency due to planned imports that are not invoiced in sterling.
These forward exchange contracts would have a maturity of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The group also enters into foreign currency contracts at spot rate where the amounts are not frequent or material.
Gains and losses on currency contracts recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2006 amounted to 62,000 2005: 43,000.
Headlam Group plc 90 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Foreign currency risk continued For the twelve month period to 31 December 2006, 4.7% 2005: 4.4% of the groups operating profit was derived from overseas subsidiaries and at 31 December 2006, 8.6% 2005: 8.5% of the groups operating assets related to overseas subsidiaries.
Hedge accounting, following the adoption of IFRS, has not been applied to these subsidiaries given their relative size and because of the onerous level of compliance required under IAS 39.
The group and company do not use derivatives other than as described above.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the company and group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on company and groups earnings.
In the short term, income statement and net asset volatility arising from these exposures is not considered significant.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates and foreign exchange has the potential to impact the consolidated income statement and carrying value of net assets.

29 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS Management discussed the development, selection and disclosure of the groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee.
In applying the accounting policies, appropriate estimates have been made in a number of areas and the actual outcome may differ from the position described in the companys and groups balance sheet at 31 December 2006.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may give rise to a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The group is committed to investing in new facilities where existing facilities fail to provide satisfactory customer service in a cost effective manner.
When construction on a new facility is initiated, the existing facility is marketed for sale and this action can on occasions give rise to an adverse difference between cost and fair value.
It has been assumed that at the balance sheet date, cost equates to fair value.
Goodwill impairment The impairment test for goodwill is dependent on the forecasts of the cash flows of the cash-generating units and the assumptions relating to growth rate.
No impairment resulted from the annual impairment test for 2006.
Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised at the balance sheet date based on the assumption that there is a high expectation that the asset will be realised in due course.
This assumption is dependant on the groups ability to generate sufficient future taxable profits.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale The inclusion of assets within non-current assets as held for sale and the realisation of the expected proceeds is based on the assumption that contracts will complete during the financial year.
A Accounts ccounts Headlam Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 99 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS - CONTINUED Employee benefits The deficit relating to the groups defined benefit pension plans is assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19 and after taking independent actuarial advice.
The amount of the deficit is dependent on plan asset and liability values and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the deficit.
Assumptions include asset growth rates, pension and salary increases, price inflation, discount rate used to measure actuarial liabilities and mortality rates.
