25 Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate derivatives The group uses interest rate derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings by the use of interest rate Collar arrangements.
Contracts with a nominal value of 25m have a Cap of 5% and a Floor of 3% for the period to 21 September 2006.
As part of this arrangement, on 21 September 2006 the groups bankers may require the group to enter into a xed rate arrangement over a nominal value of 35m at a 1 rate of 4 2% for the period from 21 September 2006 to 21 September 2008.
Should the groups bankers elect not to exercise this right on 21 September 2006, they cannot do so at a later date.
At 31 March 2006 the fair value of the groups interest rate derivatives is estimated to be an approximate liability of 0.02m 2005: 0.06m.
These amounts are based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging interest rate derivatives amounting to 42,000 have been credited to income in the year 2005: charge of 3,000.
Due to the nature of many of the groups hedging and derivative instruments, hedge accounting has not been adopted for these hedging relationships.
Consequently, movements in the fair value of derivative instruments have been recognised in the income statement.
26 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period: Short term Accelerated Retirement Other timing capital benefit intangible differences allowances obligations assets Total 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2004 2,414 4,354 6,225 6,303 2,018 Balances acquired in period 43 4,580 4,537 Credit to profit or loss for the year 788 236 281 198 941 11111 At 1 April 2005 3,245 4,118 5,944 10,685 5,614 Charge to profit or loss for the year 1,158 6 537 279 1,410 11111 At 31 March 2006 2,087 4,112 5,407 10,406 7,024 11111 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the groups accounting policy.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2006 2005 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 15,319 18,214 Deferred tax assets 8,295 12,600 11 7,024 5,614 11 At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,122,000 2005: 893,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
