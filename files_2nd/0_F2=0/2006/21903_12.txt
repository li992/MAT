Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted is set out below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP, revised December 2005, for investment trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, except as disclosed in the following paragraph.
A number of new UK Financial Reporting Standards have been introduced as part of the UK convergence programme with International Financial Reporting Standards.
The changes affecting the Company relate to FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement, FRS 25 Financial Investments: Presentation and Disclosures, and FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
A reconciliation of these changes is set out in note 22.
Expenses which are allocated to capital are available to reduce the Companys liability to corporation tax.
The SORP directs that the benefit of that tax relief should be allocated to capital and a corresponding charge made to revenue.
This is known as the marginal method of allocating tax relief between capital and revenue.
The Company does not adopt the marginal method for two reasons.
Firstly, the Company has only one class of share and any allocation of tax relief between capital and revenue would have no impact on shareholders.
Secondly, the significant unutilised management expenses and interest carried forward make it unlikely that the Company will be liable to corporation tax in the foreseeable future.
Had this allocation been made, the charge to revenue and corresponding credit to capital for the year ended 30 September 2006 would have been 640,000 2005: 729,000. b Investments Investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised on a purchase date basis.
Listed investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
Realised gains and losses on the disposal of investments are taken to Capital Reserve realised, and unrealised gains and losses on the revaluation of investments are taken to Capital Reserve unrealised as explained in note 1 c below.
c Capital reserves Capital Reserve realised The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: realised exchange differences on transactions of a capital nature: realised gains and losses on transactions undertaken to hedge exposures of a capital nature: expenses and finance costs charged to capital set out in the policies below: cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation: and special dividends of a capital nature.
Capital Reserve unrealised The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: and unrealised exchange differences in relation to forward foreign currency contracts.
32 British Assets Trust plc d Income Dividends are recognised as income on the date that the related investments are marked ex-dividend.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on an effective yield basis.
Other investment income and deposit interest are shown on an accruals basis.
Special dividends of a revenue nature are recognised through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, an amount equal to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
e Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is recognised at the standard rate of corporation tax without discounting.
The Company has no deferred tax liabilities.
f Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are all allocated as revenue with the exception of management fees which are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
Performance fees are charged 100 per cent to capital.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are taken to the Income Statement as a capital item.
g Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
h Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in capital reserves or the Revenue Reserve depending on the nature of the gain or loss.

The market value of the Companys Bonds is disclosed in note 20.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the balance sheet.
Short term debtors and creditors are excluded from disclosure as allowed by FRS 25, other than for currency disclosures.
40 British Assets Trust plc 19 Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.

Investment and portfolio performance are discussed in more detail in the Managers Review.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 14 and 15.
Derivatives may be used from time to time to hedge specific currency risk, or gain an exposure to a specific market.

Liquidity risk In respect of liquidity risk, the Companys assets comprise realisable securities.
