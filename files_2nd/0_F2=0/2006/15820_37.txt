Customers and employees We should like to thank our customers for their continued loyalty and support during a difficult year.
We shall continue to invest in developing leading products and services to help them maintain their competitiveness.
Equally, the commitment and dedication of our employees has helped us manage the difficult situation we faced in 2006, while still maintaining momentum towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives.
We should like to record our thanks for their continued support.
Outlook The overall outlook for our markets in 2007 is difficult, with the timing of recovery in trading conditions in some of our North American end-markets uncertain.
When compared to the early quarters of 2006, lower levels of demand from our customers, together with the translation effect of the weaker US dollar, are likely to impact on the reported performance of the Group.
Our management team is focused on managing the business through the current slowdown and delivering long-term value to shareholders.
Actions we are taking to tighten control over costs further will help to offset the profit impact of weaker markets and during this period, we will continue to focus on cash generation through a reduction in levels of capital expenditure and working capital.
On behalf of the Board, we should like to thank you for your support in 2006 and assure you of our continuing commitment to making Tomkins even stronger in 2007.

Summary Annual Report 2006 15 Directors report Governance Summary internal control The Directors have overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
To fulfil this responsibility the Directors have established a Performance Management Framework within which each of the Groups businesses operates.
Within this framework, the management of each of the businesses considers strategic, operational, commercial and financial risks and identifies risk mitigation actions.
Whilst acknowledging the overall responsibility for the system of internal control, the Directors are aware that the system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
During the period under review, the Directors were not aware of any control breakdowns which resulted in a material loss to the Group.
The Group has an established internal audit function: the Vice President Risk and Assurance Services directs the activities of the internal auditors on a day-to-day basis and reports direct to the Audit Committee of the Board at least four times a year.
Due to the importance and significance of the effort required to achieve Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, during the last third of 2006, the Board directed substantially all internal audit resources towards supporting this project.
Internal audits 2006 support primarily assisted management in testing the operating effectiveness of controls in higher risk areas and providing the Board with assurance over managements testing process in other risk areas.
The Directors confirm that the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the year ended 30 December 2006 has been reviewed in line with the criteria set out in the guidance for directors in the Combined Code.

Current schemes Annual bonus incentive plan The Executive Directors and senior executives participate in the Companys Annual Bonus Incentive Plan the Plan.
Each participant in the Plan receives a percentage of bonusable profit of the business for which he or she has responsibility.
Bonusable profit is based on operating profit less a charge for tax, certain exceptional items, and a charge for invested capital, and is based upon IFRS.
The objective of the Plan is to reward the senior executives for increasing the overall value created in the business, based on the margin of the after-tax return on invested capital in excess of the weighted average cost of capital.
Accordingly, bonusable profit may increase at a faster rate than operating profit where the margin of the return over the cost of capital increases.
This aligns the interests of management and shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee carries out a detailed review of the computations involved and ensures that the rules are applied consistently.
Furthermore, the independent auditors are asked to perform agreed-upon procedures on behalf of the Remuneration Committee on the calculations which underlie the computation of the bonusable profit.
The incentive bonus of the Executive Directors is based on a percentage of the bonusable profit of the Group which, for the year ended 30 December 2006, was 111.3 million 2005: 123.7 million.
Although there is no limit to the bonusable profit on which bonuses are calculated, inordinate growth in bonusable profit in any one year is unlikely to arise due to the nature of the Groups business.
Summary Annual Report 2006 19 Directors report Governance Summary Remuneration Committee report continued The Tomkins 2006 Performance Share Plan The Tomkins 2006 Performance Share Plan the PSP is a long-term incentive plan.
The PSP will provide rewards in future years only if shareholders have seen value created over the preceding three years.
The Remuneration Committee and Board believe that this creates a better alignment between executive reward and the creation of shareholder value than a standard executive share option scheme.
The PSP has four key features: i the performance baseline is established which is equal to the cost of equity and if the total shareholder return comprising dividends and increase in the share price over three years does not exceed the cost of equity over the same three-year period, no award of shares will be made: ii the award of shares will be proportional to the degree of performance over the baseline: iii there is a cap on the quantum of share awards: and iv subject to performance, awards will be made at the end of each three-year performance period.
During the year, the following maximum awards of Tomkins shares were made to James Nicol and Ken Lever under the PSP: Tomkins share Maximum No.
