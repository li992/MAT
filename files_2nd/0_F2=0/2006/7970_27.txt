5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its subsidiaries.
The principal funds are held in the UK and are final salary defined benefit pension schemes.
Most of the schemes have assets held in trust in separately administered funds although there are some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
The majority of the overseas defined benefit schemes are final salary schemes which provide a lump sum on retirement, some of which have assets held in trust in separately administered funds and others which are unfunded.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
65 Inchcape plc Annual report and accounts 2006 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued a UK schemes The UK has four main defined benefit schemes, namely the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
These schemes are considered below: i Open schemes Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme is being carried out as at 31 March 2006 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The majority of the schemes liabilities are for pensioners and deferred pensioners, and the investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of equities and bonds.
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme is being carried out as at 5 April 2006 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
Whilst a majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners, a sizeable portion of the membership is still accruing benefits and the investment strategy reflects this with the majority of the assets invested in equities.
Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported in the United Kingdom segment in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme is being carried out as at 31 March 2006 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
A significant majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners and therefore the majority of the assets are invested in bonds.
ii Closed scheme TKM Group Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2004 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy and, as at 5 April 2004, had only 0.9% invested in equities with the remainder invested in bonds.
Approximately half the members are pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises.
b Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
c Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the income statement is 2.1m 2005 2.4m.
Outstanding contributions to defined contribution schemes are 0.1m 2005 nil.
d Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported below.
The principal weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries were: United Kingdom Overseas 2006 2005 2006 2005 % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.9 4.7 5.0 4.7 Rate of increase in pensions 2.9 2.7 1.7 1.7 Discount rate 5.1 4.8 4.0 4.4 Inflation 2.9 2.7 0.9 0.7 Expected return on plan assets 5.7 5.4 7.5 6.3 The rate of increase in healthcare cost is 4.5% 2005 4.5% per annum but with higher increases in the first ten years.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 20.6 years 2005 19.8 years for current pensioners and 22.2 years 2005 21.3 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.
66 Inchcape plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the accounts continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset principally equities and bonds.
The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected real rates of return on equities and expected yields on bonds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.

The rule change permits greater commutation of pension benefits, giving members earlier access to their cash benefit at reduced amounts sooner than would otherwise be available.
The effect of this change was to reduce the scheme liabilities by 3.6m which has been reflected in the SORIE.
