Company Statement of Directors Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements.
The Directors have chosen to prepare the financial statements for the Company in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period and comply with UK GAAP and the Companies Act 1985.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for the system of internal controls, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
