The financial information has been prepared on a historic cost basis as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The Companys functional currency is the US Dollar.
The reporting currency is also the US Dollar.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
Significant accounting policies Intangible fixed assets Other intangible fixed assets Other intangible fixed assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their useful life in accordance with FRS 10.
Joint arrangements The Company has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own.
The Company includes its share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro-rata to the Companys interest in the joint arrangement.
Investments Investments are held at fair value.
Where no market value is available the carrying value of net assets less impairment is used.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recorded at cost or valuation, which are not updated under the transitional arrangements of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets, less depreciation.
Depreciation on fixed assets is provided on a straight line basis.
Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives to residual value.
Depreciation rates for the principal assets of the Company are as follows: Method Rate Short term leasehold property Straight line Over the life of the lease 3 5 years Plant and equipment Straight line 10% 33% per annum 3 10 years Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher in accordance with FRS 11.
Financial instruments The Companys principal financial instruments other than derivatives comprise bank loans, listed convertible bonds, investments, cash and short-term deposits.
Bank loans are recorded at amortised cost, net of transaction costs incurred, and are adjusted to amortise transaction costs over the term of the loan.
The Company has raised debt through the issue of convertible bonds.
These bonds incorporate two key elements.
Firstly, there is the financial liability in respect of the debt element.
This is measured at net present value of future cash flows.
Secondly, the bonds allow for conversion to equity at the option of the bond holder.
This represents an equity embedded derivative.
However, as the Company retains a cash settlement option this equity conversion feature is shown as a financial liability if the fair value is greater than the net present value of the debt.
This embedded derivative is fair valued at each period end with changes in the fair value being taken through the income statement.

Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for on timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date on a nondiscounted basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits The Company operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in accordance with UK regulations.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are administered by trustees.
Independent actuaries prepare valuations of these schemes at least every three years and in accordance with their recommendations the Company makes contributions which are charged to profits on a systematic basis over the expected remaining working lives of the employees.
Any differences between the actuarial valuation of the obligation and the value of assets in a scheme are similarly charged or credited to profit before taxation over the expected remaining working lives of employees in the scheme.
The cost of defined contribution schemes is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Share based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
The Company makes equity-settled share-based payments, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
For those share schemes which do not include non-market vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo method at the grant date and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model.
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the date of grant.
For all share schemes with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the IFRS charge.
Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
Share options and own shares held In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 National insurance contributions on share option gains UITF 25 the Company provides in full for the employers national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options granted.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption offered in Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 Employee share schemes UITF 17 from charging to the profit and loss account the discounts offered to employees partaking in such Company operated SAYE schemes.
As required under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 the cost to the Company of own shares held is shown as a deduction from shareholders funds within the profit and loss account.
Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Dividend reinvestment program Under the Companys Dividend Reinvestment Plan, shareholders can elect for the whole of their cash dividends to be reinvested in Lonmin Plc shares which are purchased on their behalf in the market.
All cash dividends are paid to the Registrars who use the dividends of participants in the plan to fund these purchases.
Accordingly, no new shares are issued, dividends are paid and accounted for in the normal way, and there are no special accounting requirements for the programme.

indd Proof: 12 Proof Read by: Operator: Dave Date: 23 11 2006 Server: studio 1 Set-up: Rob First Read Revisons 37 Accounting policies continued Changes in accounting policies The following UK GAAP accounting policy changes have been made in the year: FRS 17 Retirement benefits: FRS 20 Share based payments: FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date: FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation: FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement: and FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
Adoption of FRS 17 Retirement benefits For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Company is required to account for retirement benefit plans in accordance with FRS 17, and is required to apply the requirements of FRS 17 retrospectively.
Accordingly, an asset of $6 million 2005 $12 million has been recognised on the balance sheet.
Adoption of FRS 20 Share-based payments The Standard requires options granted to directors to be measured at fair value at grant date using an option pricing model and charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the options.
This accounting change has reduced net profit for the Company for the year ended 30 September 2005 by $0.2 million.
Had the previous policy been applied in 2006, net profit would have been $2.7 million higher.
Adoption of FRS 21 For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Company is required to account for events occurring after the balance sheet date FRS 21, and is required to apply the requirements of FRS 21 retrospectively.
Accordingly, the 2005 final equity dividend of $60 million previously recognised at 30 September 2005 within creditors due within one year has been reversed since it was not declared at the balance sheet date.
This has increased net assets at 30 September 2005.
Adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Company is required to measure and disclose amounts defined as financial instruments in accordance with FRS 25 and FRS 26.
The Company has chosen to restate comparative information.
The impact of adopting FRS 25 and FRS 26 is discussed below: Convertible bond: i Embedded derivative On adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26, the fair value of the embedded derivative was calculated.
Subsequent movements in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recognized in finance costs in the profit and loss account.
The impact of this change was the recognition of a $41 million embedded derivative liability within other financial liabilities as at 1 October 2005 and $268 million as at 30 September 2006. ii Underlying debt instrument The fair value of the liability component was calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows under the terms of the instrument using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The impact of this change was a reduction in the liability as at 1 October 2005 of $3 million.
The Company has not adopted amendments to FRS 26 in relation to guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 October 2006.
The Company has also applied the following UK standards for the first time in 2006, however, this has not represented a change in accounting policy previously applied and it has not been necessary to restate any comparative information: FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates: FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
