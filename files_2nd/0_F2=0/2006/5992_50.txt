Dened benefit schemes The principal UK scheme the Findel Group Pension Scheme was assessed by Aon Consulting, the schemes actuaries, at 6 April 2004 using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were that the annual rate of return on investments would be between 0.25% and 1.50% higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and between 2.25% and 3.50% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 83% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration.
The market value of the schemes assets at the date of valuation was 44.8m.
The next valuation is due in April 2007.

These schemes were assessed by Aon Consulting, the schemes actuaries, at 6 April 2004.
The principal of these schemes, accounting for 84% of the combined assets and 85% of the combined liabilities of the schemes, was assessed using the Attained Age method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were that the annual rate of return on investments would be between 0.50% and 3% higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and between 2% and 4.5% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 71% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration.
