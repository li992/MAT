1 Accounting policies continued Actuarial gains and losses may result from: differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets: differences between the actuarial assumption underlying the plan liabilities and actual experience during the year: or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognized in the statement of total recognized gains and losses.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Use of estimates The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.
