Profit loss arising on property related items have been reclassified under UK GAAP in 2004 and prior periods in order to be consistent with the IFRS presentation.
First disclosed in the Annual report and financial statements 2003.
Results for 2005 are presented on a 52 week basis to aid comparability with the current period.
The 53 week 2005 results under both IFRS and UK GAAP are summarised on page 81 and are available in full from the Companys website, www.
The 2005 results on a 52 week basis are unaudited.
The Mitchells & Butlers group was created on its separation from Six Continents on 15 April 2003.
Significant changes were made to the financing structure of the Group which resulted in the replacement of inter company balances owed to Six Continents with external debt.
In addition, the Mitchells & Butlers group no longer benefited from the Six Continents group tax arrangements that were in place prior to the separation.
The pro forma group profit and loss accounts for 2003 and 2002 therefore present the results on the basis that the post separation financing and taxation structure had been in place since 1 October 2002.
The pro forma profit and loss accounts are also stated before exceptional items.
Adjusted earnings per share is stated after removing the impact of exceptional items, less tax thereon.
The adjustments required to make UK GAAP historic information consistent with that presented under IFRS relate to share-based payment charges and the different calculation basis of deferred tax under IFRS.
Further detail is given in note 34.
