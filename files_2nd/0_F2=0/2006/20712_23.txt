ii Interest rate repricing table The following tables provide a summary of the interest rate repricing profile of the Group and Company assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2006.
Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate reset date and the contractual maturity date.
Financial assets and liabilities with a floating rate are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, and this risk is reflected predominantly in the time bands below twelve months.
Financial assets and liabilities with a fixed rate are exposed to fair value interest rate risk, which is reflected predominantly in the time bands beyond twelve months.
Financial assets and liabilities not directly exposed to interest rate risk will appear in the non-interest bearing time band.
The table takes account of derivative financial interests whose effect is to alter the interest basis of Group assets and liabilities.
The trading book and non-interest bearing balances have been included in a separate column.

Due from and to other banks The fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
The estimated fair value of fixed rate loans and deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
Loans and advances to customers and due to customers Floating rate loans and advances and deposits are recorded in the balance sheet using the Effective Interest Rate EIR method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered to be a good approximation for fair value.
For fixed rate loans and advances and deposits the fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on the instruments at current market interest rates.
Net investment in finance leases and hire purchase contracts The fair value of floating rate assets is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
The estimated fair value of fixed rate assets is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
Investment securities, debt securities in issue, and other borrowed funds Fair values are based on quoted market prices.
For instruments where quoted market prices are not available, the market price is based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for securities with similar credit, maturity and yield characteristics.
4 Critical accounting estimates and areas of significant management judgement Some asset and liability amounts reported in the accounts are based on management judgements, estimates and assumptions.
There is therefore a risk of significant changes to the carrying amounts for these assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment provisions The level of potential credit losses is uncertain and depends on a number of factors such as unemployment levels, interest rates, house price levels and other general economic conditions.
The Group bases impairment provisions on estimates based on historical loss experience.
Actual cash flows on financial assets may differ from management judgements and estimates, resulting in an increase or decrease in impairment charges and provisions.
These models used in calculating the impairment provisions do not contain judgemental inputs, but judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
To the extent that actual losses incurred differ from that estimated by -10%, the impairment provisions on loans and advances would change by an estimated 13.5m higher or 13.4m lower respectively.
Effective interest rate calculations IAS 39 requires certain financial assets and liabilities to be held at amortised cost, with income recognised using the EIR methodology.
In order to calculate EIR, it is necessary to estimate the level of repayments that will be made before the contractual due date.
For residential mortgages the estimated level and timing of redemptions is critical to the EIR calculation.
If customers leave earlier than anticipated, this will generally lead to a reduction in the balance sheet carrying value, and a corresponding charge to the income statement.
If our view of expected average product lives was to fall by one month, consistently across all product categories, this would lead to a fall in the carrying value of mortgage balances of 15.6m.
Conversely an increase in expected average product lives of one month would lead to an increase in the carrying value of mortgage balances of 15.5m.
Retirement benefit obligations The income statement cost and balance sheet liability of the defined benefit pension scheme and post-retirement medical benefits are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
Assumptions are made for inflation, the rate of increase in salaries and pensions, the rate used to discount scheme liabilities, the expected return on scheme assets and mortality rates.
Changes to any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the balance sheet liabilities, and to a lesser extent the income statement costs.
Further information is available in Note 33.

Fair values are calculated using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, where market values are not available.
Changes in assumptions used in the models could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The gain is primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.

During this period the Group reached agreement with HM Revenue & Customs regarding the tax treatment of the excess of 230m over the outstanding asset balances received on the disposal of the credit card accounts to MBNA on 1 August 2002.
This agreement has resulted in the release of a tax provision of 29.7m.
The underlying effective tax rate for 2006 was 27.0% 2005: 26.5%.
The calculation of the 2006 underlying effective tax rate excludes the release of the tax provision of 29.7m.
It further excludes the tax charge of 2.3m in respect of the 7.6m fair value accounting volatility gain, the tax credit of 7.3m in respect of the 24.2m of redundancy costs primarily relating to the re-organisation of the Groups current accounts back office operations, and takes into consideration, in calculating underlying profits, the appropriation of profit of 17.5m in respect of our innovative tier 1 capital securities.
The 2005 underlying effective tax rate excludes a tax credit of 0.3m in respect of the 1.0m fair value accounting volatility loss and takes into consideration, in calculating underlying profits, the appropriation of profit of 17.5m in respect of our innovative tier 1 capital securities.
Further information about deferred tax is presented in Note 31 on page 81.
The Group expects to maintain an underlying effective tax rate around that achieved in 2006.
The effective rate of tax for the year of 20.9% is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30%, where the Group generates substantially all its profits.

Basic statutory earnings per ordinary share of 96.4p 2005: 86.9p are calculated by dividing the Group profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 432.2m 2005: 389.4m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend of 448.4m 2005: 448.0m.
Underlying basic earnings per ordinary share were 92.4p 2005: 87.1p.
These are provided to disclose the trend in earnings excluding the distorting effect of non-operating items.
They are based on the same number of ordinary shares and the core profit after tax for the year after excluding the redundancy costs in 2006, impacts arising from fair value accounting volatility, less the associated tax charges and the release of the tax provision relating to the sale of the credit card accounts as shown below.
If the release of the tax provision is included within core profit after tax then earnings per ordinary share are 99.0p.

The Fair value option is used by the Group where Treasury assets or liabilities would otherwise be measured at amortised cost, the associated derivatives used to economically hedge the risk are held at fair value, and it is not practical to apply hedge accounting.
The Group has also designated certain financial instruments containing embedded derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
The table below shows the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities that upon initial recognition, or at 1 January 2005 on the adoption of IAS 39, were designated at fair value through profit or loss, and the net gains or losses on these instruments.

This is calculated by comparing i the net present value of the cash flows at the start of the year using the benchmark interest rate at the end of the year, adjusted for cash flows during the year and for the increase in fair value because cash flows are one year closer, and ii the observed market price at the end of the year.

New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a defined contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is an exempt approved pension scheme under which retirement and death benefits are provided for Group employees.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the finances of the participating employers.
In addition, benefits are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989 whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The Group has adopted the revised IAS 19, published in December 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in full, through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2006.
Scheme liabilities are based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2006 and updated by an independent qualified actuary to assess the liabilities as at 31 December 2006.
Alliance & Leicester plc is the sponsoring employer for the Scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for recharging the defined benefit cost to other companies in the Group.
Therefore, in accordance with IAS 19, the Company recognises the whole defined benefit liability of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Group 2006 2005 m m Present value of funded obligations 1,327.3 1,304.7 Fair value of Scheme assets 1,310.5 1,230.4 16.8 74.3 Present value of unfunded obligations 9.5 9.6 Liability in the balance sheet 26.3 83.9 82 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: Group 2006 2005 m m 1 Current service cost 22.2 18.1 2 Interest cost 64.4 60.8 2 Expected return on Scheme assets 72.2 64.2 1 Past service cost 1.0 1.9 Total cost defined benefit Scheme 15.4 12.8 1 Defined contribution Scheme-contributions by employer including SMART 8.5 5.5 Total cost 23.9 18.3 Notes: 1.

Changes in the fair value of Scheme assets are as follows: Group 2006 2005 m m At 1 January 1,230.4 1,060.3 Expected return 72.2 64.2 Actuarial gain 13.2 107.9 Contributions by employer including SMART 26.0 17.4 Employee contributions 2.9 6.9 Benefits paid 34.2 26.3 At 31 December 1,310.5 1,230.4 Actual return on Scheme assets 85.4 172.1 The Group expects to contribute 19.4% of pensionable salary to its defined benefit Scheme in 2007 excluding SMART.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2006 2005 Valuation method Projected unit Projected unit Inflation assumption 3.0% 2.75% Salaries rate of increase p. a.
3.5% 4.5% Pensions rate of increase p. a.
3.0% 2.75% Discount rate used to determine net pension cost 4.9% 5.4% Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations at 31 December 5.2% 4.9% Expected return on Scheme equities 7.5% 7.5% Expected return on Scheme bonds 4.5% 5.0% The discount rate used to calculate the present value of Scheme liabilities is determined after considering the yield on 'AA' rated Sterling corporate bond yields of a similar maturity to the Scheme liabilities.
A 0.1% increase in the rate used would decrease the present value of Scheme liabilities by 27.1m and a 0.1% decrease in the rate used would increase the present value of Scheme liabilities by 27.8m.
A 0.1% decrease in the rate of inflation would reduce the Scheme liabilities by 24.9m and a 0.1% increase in the rate of inflation would increase the Scheme liabilities by 23.5m.
The expected return on Scheme equities for 2007 is set at a level of 3.3% above gilt yields.
The Scheme actuary has advised that this return has a 50% likelihood of being achieved.
The expected return for Scheme bonds for 2007 has been set based on yields available on market indices at 31 December 2006 for bonds with similar maturities.

These are described below, with further details given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 40 to 41. i ShareSave Plan This plan is open to all employees.
Participants may elect to save up to 250 per month under a three year or five year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a price based on 80% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
At the end of the savings contract, a tax free bonus is applied to the savings and the option to buy shares becomes exercisable, for a period of six months.
Options are exercisable earlier if an employee leaves the Group in special circumstances.
ii Share Incentive Plan SIP free shares Eligible employees were, until 2005, awarded free shares each year, based on a percentage of their salary.
There were no performance criteria attached to the release of SIP free shares.
iii Share Incentive Plan partnership shares SIP partnership shares are available to all employees.
Participants may elect to save up to 125 per month from pre-tax salary to purchase shares at the prevailing market price.
There are no performance criteria attached to the release of SIP partnership shares.
iv Executive Share Options Executive Options are normally granted to executive, associate and divisional directors twice a year, after the final and interim results announcements.
The number of shares over which options are granted is based on a multiple of the participants salary.
The exercise of options is subject to a three year performance condition based on Earnings Per Share EPS growth detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 40.
Options lapse ten years from the grant date.
Group Senior Managers also received awards of options under the Company Share Option Plans until 2005. v Deferred Bonus Plan Group Senior Managers, excluding executive, associate and divisional directors, can defer up to 25% of their annual cash bonus into shares, which are then matched by the Company.
The right to purchase those shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapses if not exercised within seven years.
Executive directors participated in the Deferred Bonus Plan until 2005.
Performance conditions were attached to the receipt of matching shares.
vi Executive Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan for executive directors was introduced in 2005 and participation was extended to associate and divisional directors in 2006.
The annual award of shares is normally over shares and accrued dividends to the value of 100% to 150% of annual salary.
The performance period is three years with no re-testing.
For awards made in 2005 and 2006, the vesting of 50% of the award depends on the performance of the Companys Total shareholder return TSR relative to a peer group of retail banks: the vesting of the other 50% of the award depends on the percentage growth in EPS, with vesting starting when adjusted EPS growth exceeds inflation by 3% per annum, and full vesting when adjusted EPS exceeds inflation by 8% per annum.
For awards made in 2007, an additional performance test will be introduced.
One third of shares will vest according to the Companys return on equity RoE performance: 30% of the award will vest for RoE of 20%, rising to full vesting for RoE of 24%.
The other two thirds of the award will vest as before, according to the Companys TSR and EPS performances.
See the Directors Remuneration Report on page 41 for details.
vii Restricted Share Plan RSP Group Senior Managers, excluding executive, associate and divisional directors, participate in the RSP.
Annual awards of shares are made based on a percentage of individuals salary.
In 2006, the percentage range was 015%.
Awards vest automatically after three years and lapse after five years from the grant date.
The figures in the table relate to the number of deferred options only.
The figures in the table relate to the level of bonus deferred i. e. excluding the matching element.
The option value includes the deferred share and the fair value of the matched element, less the cash bonus foregone.
Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2006 87 Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 39 Share-based payments continued No SIP free shares were allocated during the year 2005: 202,596 at a price of 876.5p.
152,654 SIP partnership shares were issued during the year, at the prevailing market rate, at a weighted average price of 1043.3p per share.
51,271 partnership shares were issued in January 2005 at a price of 845.5p per share and 61,538 shares in July 2005 at a price of 884.5p per share.
The fair value of these awards was between 26p and 52p per share.
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying the following models: Share Incentive Plan Black-Scholes option pricing model: Executive Share Options and ShareSave Plan restricted exercise binomial model for American style options: Deferred Bonus Plan and Executive Performance Share Plan the value of the share price option plus the present value of any deferred dividends.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 15%-21.5% 2005: 11%-12% Expected volatility is estimated by calculating the annualised, exponential weighted monthly volatility of Alliance & Leicester plc share price over the preceding two years Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk-free interest rate 4.6%-5.3% 2005:4.5%-4.9% Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
