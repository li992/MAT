27 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life insurance company and an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
In other territories, the Group provides other post employment benefits.
In particular, in Greece and Italy, the Group has state related obligations to pay post employment benefits to employees.
a Defined contribution pension schemes The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was 2.3 million 2004 05 1.3 million.
A further 0.1 million 2004 05 0.1 million provision was made in respect of the Nordic unsecured pension arrangement.
b Defined benefit pension schemes actuarial valuation and assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2004 using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
The Groups contribution rate for the period ended 29 April 2006, agreed in consultation with the trustees actuaries, was 11.9 per cent 2004 05 10.9 per cent.
The contribution rate for future periods is planned to increase to 12.9 per cent in August 2006.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 101 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27 Retirement benefit obligations continued The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2004 used for determining costs and contributions were: Rate per annum Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.0% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.75% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.75% Discount rate for accrued benefits 6.5% Inflation 2.5% Investment return for future service benefits 6.75% At 5 April 2004, the market value of the scheme's investments was 422 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 87 per cent of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The value of liabilities exceeded assets by 62 million.
c Defined benefit pension schemes and other post employment benefits IAS 19 The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the respective plans.
The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Principal assumptions adopted UK defined benefit pension plan Other post employment benefits Rates per annum 2006 2005 2006 2005 Discount rate 5.3% 5.5% 4.1 4.5% 4.5 6.0% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.3% 4.2% 2.5 3.0% 2.5 3.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment deferred pensions 2.8% 2.7% Inflation 2.8% 2.7% 2.5 3.3% 2.5 3.4% The Group uses certain mortality rate assumptions when calculating scheme obligations.
The demographic assumptions used are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 5 April 2004.
In particular, post retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard tables PMA PFA 92 C 2004, with a 0.25 per cent reduction to the discount rate in payment to allow for future mortality improvement.
Such tables represent an average expected longevity of 84.1 years for men and 87.2 years for women.
The current mortality rates include prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and also take account of historical experience.
