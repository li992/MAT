6 Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation liabilities, using the liability method, on all material timing differences, including revaluation gains and losses on investments recognised in the profit and loss account, as the investments are revalued.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the rates at which it is expected that the tax will arise, and discounted to take into account the likely timing of payments and pattern of expected realisation of investments.
Deferred taxation is recognised in the profit and loss account for the period, except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or loss that is recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
7 Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are expressed in sterling at rates ruling on that date.
Income and expenditure denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates ruling at the date on which the transaction occurs.
All resulting exchange gains and losses are included within the part of the profit and loss account in which the underlying transaction is reported.
