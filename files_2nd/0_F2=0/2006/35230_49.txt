Notes to the financial statements 35 Leases The group has the following future minimum lease receipts under the operating leases entered into with its tenants: 2006 2005 m m Future minimum lease receipts on operating leases expiring: less than 1 year 0.9 4.0 between 15 years 43.6 49.1 more than 5 years 617.4 347.4 661.9 400.5 36 Contingent liabilities The company and its subsidiaries are party to cross guarantees securing the overdraft and certain bank loans.
At 31st December 2006 the maximum liability that could arise for the company from the cross guarantees amounted to 1.5m 2005: 2.0m.
The company has guaranteed its share of a loan to Primister Limited, the contingent liability for which at 31st December 2006 amounted to 2.8m 2005: 2.8m.
In addition, the company guarantees its share of interest payable on this loan which amounts to 0.3m per annum 2005: 0.3m.
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the group, the company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

46 Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 37 Post balance sheet event continued Subject to completion of the verication exercise, net assets acquired at 1st February 2007 were: Book value of net Fair value of net assets acquired assets acquired m m Non-current assets Investment property 1,239.6 1,245.6 Property, plant and equipment 6.8 1.6 Investments 19.3 19.3 Derivative financial instruments 6.1 6.1 Deferred tax asset 15.2 15.2 Pension scheme surplus 1.4 1.4 1,288.4 1,289.2 Current assets Trading property 48.3 62.5 Trade and other receivables 17.3 17.3 Cash and cash equivalents 13.9 13.9 79.5 93.7 Total assets 1,367.9 1,382.9 Current liabilities Bank loans 4.6 4.6 Trade and other payables 38.5 39.3 43.1 43.9 Non-current liabilities Financial liabilities 482.2 512.4 Deferred tax liability 150.7 145.4 Other 4.6 6.8 637.5 664.6 Total liabilities 680.6 708.5 Net assets acquired 687.3 674.4 Goodwill on acquisition 291.2 Cost of acquisition 965.6 Adjustments from book value to fair value include those arising from the application of Derwent Londons accounting policies, and fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment, trading property and debt.
A detailed review of the existence of intangible assets other than goodwill has already been concluded, and none were found to have any material value.
An impairment test is being carried out on the goodwill arising on the acquisition.
The properties acquired on the acquisition of LMS complement the existing portfolio of properties held by the group.
It is anticipated that, in future, the group will be capable of deriving signicantly enhanced cashows from the acquired portfolio due to future lease management, refurbishment and redevelopment, which are proposed to be made to the acquired property portfolio.
While the amount that the group has paid for LMS is justied by these anticipated enhancements and benets that will be brought to the group, IAS 36, Impairment of Assets does not permit such enhancements to be included in the cashows used in estimating value in use for the purposes of impairment testing, and instead requires the cashows to be based on the assets in their current condition.
In addition, the benets arising from the acquired portfolio are specic to the group and, consequently, the fair value less costs to sell off the acquired business is unlikely to support the carrying amount of the goodwill associated with the acquisition.
Therefore, it is anticipated that an impairment charge will be recorded in 2007, which will be approximately equal to the carrying amount of goodwill that has arisen on the post balance sheet acquisition.
