LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 44 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2 MARCH 2006 1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING BUSINESS SEGMENTS The Group is principally engaged as owner, developer and operator of theme bars, nightclubs and restaurants.
At the start of the year, the segmentation of the Group was changed to reflect the future strategy of the business.
Comparative income statement and cash flow information has been reclassified at the balance sheet date to reflect the composition of the segments as at these dates segmental information therefore reflects a consistent number of units within each segment for each period presented.
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three main business segments Dancing, Entertainment and Non-Core operations.
Non-Core operations includes units, both trading and closed, which do not align with the Groups strategy of a high quality predominantly branded and market-led business, together with sub-let sites.

The differences are explained as follows: Year ended Year ended 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m Profit on ordinary activities from continuing operations before tax 22.9 24.5 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2005: 30% 6.9 7.4 EFFECTS OF: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.2 1.1 Non-deductible exceptional items 2.4 1.7 Utilisation of capital losses not previously recognised 2.1 Rollover relief on profit on disposal of property 1.5 Adjustments in respect of the prior year 1.1 6.5 Non-qualifying depreciation 2.3 1.8 Total tax charge from continuing operations for the year 4.0 7.0 LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 51 6 DIVIDENDS Year ended Year ended 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m Ordinary shares final dividend paid for 2005: 9.76p per share final dividend paid for 2004: 8.87p per share 7.1 6.5 Ordinary shares interim dividend paid for 2006: 4.44p per share interim dividend paid for 2005: 4.04p per share 3.2 3.0 10.3 9.5 In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the current financial year of 10.74p per share, which will absorb an estimated 7.9m of shareholders equity.
This dividend is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, and has not been included as a liability within these financial statements.
7 EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of the basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options granted to Directors and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year, and the contingently issuable shares under the Companys long-term incentive plan i. e. the Deferred Bonus Plan see note 28.
At the year end the performance criteria for the vesting of awards under the long-term incentive plan had not been met and consequently these potential shares are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
An alternative measure of earnings per share from continuing operations pre-exceptional items has been included below as the Directors believe that this measure of earnings per share is more reflective of the ongoing trading of the Company.
Reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

8 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS A CONTINUING OPERATIONS The Group incurred exceptional items on continuing operations as follows: Year ended Year ended 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO TRADING UNITS Impairment of property, plant and equipment on trading units 0.3 7.6 on units held for sale 1.5 Reversal of prior years impairment of property, plant and equipment 9.5 Impairment of goodwill 15.7 2.0 Provision for onerous lease commitments 0.6 Reversal of provision for onerous lease commitments 0.6 Profit on sale and leaseback of property, plant and equipment 7.7 Costs relating to reorganisation and rationalisation 2.5 0.7 11.7 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO THE CLOSURE OF PROPERTIES Impairment of property, plant and equipment on closed units 8.1 2.4 on head office property 3.1 Impairment of goodwill 3.3 Provision for onerous lease commitments 4.9 0.1 19.4 2.5 PRE-TAX EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS 20.1 14.2 TAX ON EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 6.9 3.5 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS 13.2 10.7 LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 53 8 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS continued The exceptional items recognised within continuing operations have been split between those items relating to the Groups exit from Non-Core operations and the relocation of its head office and those associated with ongoing trading of the Group.
These units, although closed, were not actively marketed prior to the balance sheet date.
As a result these units do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and therefore have been presented within continuing operations.
i Exceptional items relating to trading units The reversal of prior years impairment charges of 9.5m 2005: nil, has arisen as the trigger causing the original impairment to be recognised has reversed, i. e. where it is now planned to re-brand a unit.
The impairment of property, plant and equipment on trading units of 0.3m 2005: 7.6m principally reflects the difference between the value-in-use of cash generating units e. g. discrete trading units and their carrying value.
The impairment of goodwill of 15.7m 2005: 2.0m has been recorded following the annual impairment test required by IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
The impairment has been recognised against goodwill allocated to the Entertainment and Non-Core segments, as a result of a decline in the performance of the Entertainment division, specifically Jumpin Jaks units, and Non-Core units still trading pending their ultimate disposal.
Further details surrounding the impairment charges can be found in note 10.
A reversal of previously recognised provisions for onerous lease commitments of 0.6m 2005: nil has been recognised from changes to the intended use of the Groups units as a result of the re-branding strategy.
During the year the Group realised profits of 7.7m 2005: nil on the sale and leaseback of three sites Hemel Hempstead, the Milton Keynes head office and Bury St Edmunds, for a total consideration of 28.0m, received in cash.
Deferred income of 6.3m, relating to proceeds receivable above the fair value of the properties disposed, has been recognised on the balance sheet and will be amortised to the income statement over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Costs of reorganisation and rationalisation of 2.5m 2005: nil have been incurred in respect of the strategic review of the Entertainment division, together with costs associated with the relocation and back-office rationalisation of the Groups administration centres.
ii Exceptional items relating to the closure of properties The impairment of property, plant and equipment of 11.2m 2005: 2.4m has arisen from the closure of units in the Non-Core segment pending their ultimate disposal resulting in a charge of 8.1m 2005: 2.4m, and a charge of 3.1m 2005: nil from the remeasurement to the fair value less costs of sale of the Groups former administration centres following the relocation of the head office to Milton Keynes.
Goodwill attributed to closed sites within the Non-Core segment, 3.3m 2005: nil, has been impaired following the annual impairment review required under IFRS 3.
The charges arising from onerous lease commitments of 4.9m 2005: 0.1m is to recognise the obligation for rent and rates on currently vacant or closed units, where the likelihood of assignment of the lease or sub-let of the property is unlikely in the short term.
These units are closed or vacant following the relocation of the Groups administration centres and the closure of Non-Core sites not suitable for re-branding.
B DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The Group incurred exceptional items relating to discontinued operations as follows: Year ended Year ended 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m Impairment on property, plant and equipment 12.7 31.0 Reversal of prior year impairment 2.5 Impairment of goodwill 14.7 2.9 24.9 33.9 Other costs associated with disposals 1.5 Provision for onerous lease commitments 2.0 3.1 Reversal of provision for onerous lease commitments 1.2 Realised loss on disposal of the Enterprise division 3.0 Realised profit loss on disposals 3.2 0.8 PRE-TAX EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 25.5 39.3 TAX ON EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 7.4 4.8 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 18.1 34.5 LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 54 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2 MARCH 2006 8 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS continued The impairment of property, plant and equipment of 12.7m 2005: 31.0m has resulted from remeasuring to fair value less costs of sale units held for sale.
The reversal of prior year impairment charges of 2.5m 2005: nil has resulted from the upward remeasurement of units held for sale to the extent of previously recognised impairment charges.
The impairment of goodwill of 14.7m 2005: 2.9m has arisen following the annual impairment test required under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, as a result of remeasuring Non-Core units held for sale at their fair value less costs of sale.
The provision for onerous lease commitments 2.0m 2005: 3.1m, relating to sites presented within discontinued operations, has arisen from the closure of sites following the decision to exit from Non-Core operations.
The reversal of previously recognised provisions of 1.2m 2005: nil has arisen as a result of settlement of lease surrender premiums at a lower level than previously provided for.
An exceptional loss on disposal of the Enterprise division, 3.0m 2005: nil, has been recognised on completion of the sale during the first half of the 2005 06 financial year as outlined in note 9.
The profit on disposal of single sites of 3.2m 2005: 0.8m loss has arisen on the disposal of 15 units for consideration of 10.0m, of which 5.2m has been received in cash during the year, with receivables of 4.8m outstanding at the year end.
9 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Comparative income statement and cash flow information is restated at each balance sheet date to reflect the composition of discontinued operations as at the latest balance sheet date.
A RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The results of the discontinued operations, which comprise the Enterprise division and other Non-Core units, either disposed of or held for sale, forming part of the Groups plan to exit from its Non-Core operations, included within the Consolidated Income Statement, were as follows: Year ended Year ended 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m Revenue 42.1 87.0 Expenses 39.4 73.0 Finance costs 0.1 0.1 Profit before tax 2.6 13.9 Attributable tax expenses credits 1.7 4.7 Profit after tax before exceptional items 0.9 18.6 Exceptional items: Remeasurement to held for sale 24.9 35.4 Loss on disposal of the Enterprise division 3.0 Other exceptional items see note 8B 2.4 3.9 Attributable tax credits 7.4 4.8 Net loss attributable to discontinued operations 17.2 15.9 On 10 June 2005, the Group completed the disposal of its wholly owned subsidiary, Candu Entertainment Limited, which held 49 nightclubs forming the major part of its Enterprise division.
The net loss realised on the disposal totalled 3.0m.
Consideration for the disposal totalled 26.8m, of which initial cash consideration represented 22.6m, deferred contingent consideration recognised on satisfaction of these contingencies represented 3.2m, with additional deferred contingent consideration not yet accrued within the financial statements totalling 1.0m.
Cash disposed on the sale of the Enterprise division totalled 0.3m.
Consolidated net assets disposed amounted to 27.2m, of which the material amounts were property, plant and equipment, with costs and asset write-downs associated with the transaction above those charged in the year to 27 February 2005 totalling 1.6m.
LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 55 9 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE continued B CASH FLOW FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 38 includes the following cash flows arising from discontinued operations.
Year ended Year ended 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m Net cash flows from operating activities 4.3 17.3 Net cash flows from investment activities 25.8 6.5 Net cash flows from financing activities 30.1 23.8 C ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF UNITS HELD FOR SALE On 2 March 2006, 46 units were classified as held for sale, of which 43 units were within the Non-Core segment, with 1 unit from each of the Dancing and Entertainment segments and 1 head office property.
These units were being actively marketed at the balance sheet date and a number of offers had been received against the majority of these units, which formed the basis for the estimates of fair value less costs of sale for these units.
An external valuation was used to estimate fair value less costs of sale in the absence of receiving an offer from external parties.
A net charge of 24.9m 2005: 35.4m has been recognised on remeasurement of units held for sale to fair value less costs of sale, which includes an upward revaluation to fair value less costs of sale of 2.5m, to the extent of previously recognised impairment losses.
All units are highly probable of being disposed of within 12 months from the balance sheet date, apart from 4 units for which contracts have been unconditionally exchanged before the year end, but have an agreed completion date of August 2007.
Since the year end two units, which were held for sale, have been disposed of.
The leases on these units were surrendered to the landlord, at a cost of 1.6m, which was fully provided for at the balance sheet date.

LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 56 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2 MARCH 2006 10 GOODWILL m COST At 28 February 2005 208.0 Recognised on acquisition of trade and assets of a business note 11 8.1 AT 2 MARCH 2006 216.1 ACCUMULATED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES At 28 February 2005 4.9 Impairment losses for the year 33.7 AT 2 MARCH 2006 38.6 CARRYING AMOUNT AT 2 MARCH 2006 177.5 m COST At 1 March 2004 and 27 February 2005 208.0 ACCUMULATED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES At 1 March 2004 Impairment losses for the year 4.9 AT 27 FEBRUARY 2005 4.9 CARRYING AMOUNT AT 27 FEBRUARY 2005 203.1 During the year ended 2 March 2006, the Group acquired the assets and trade of 13 units of which 10 are large capacity clubs from The Nightclub Company see note 11, resulting in 8.1m of goodwill.
This goodwill has been allocated to the Dancing segment.
The majority of the Groups goodwill, excluding the acquisition during the current year, arose from the acquisition of units that now predominantly form part of the Dancing segment and which were acquired from either Allied Leisure plc on 6 December 1999 or from Northern Leisure plc on 11 July 2000.
Goodwill by Segment A Cash Generating Unit CGU is deemed to be an individual operating unit, as each unit generates profits and cash flows that are largely independent from other units.
Where multiple CGUs are acquired as part of a single business combination, the goodwill arising from the business combination is attributed to individual CGUs, but is grouped together at a segment level, being the lowest level that management monitors goodwill.
Accordingly, CGUs have been grouped together at a segmental level for the purpose of the annual impairment review of goodwill.
During the year, the Group reviewed the composition of its segments, and realigned the segments to reflect the manner in which the business is effectively managed.
Goodwill allocated to each segment has been revised following this realignment, and the Group has reallocated goodwill between the segments using a relative value approach, based on the value-in-use of each CGU at 28 February 2005.
The following table outlines the changes to the allocation of goodwill resulting from the re-segmentation of the Groups operations: Dancing Entertainment Non-Core Total m m m m CARRYING VALUE ALLOCATED AT 27 FEBRUARY 2005 198.3 4.8 203.1 Re-segmentation of units at 28 February 2005 33.4 9.3 24.1 Goodwill arising on acquisition of assets and trade from the Nightclub Company 8.1 8.1 Carrying value prior to annual impairment review 173.0 14.1 24.1 211.2 Impairment 9.6 24.1 33.7 CARRYING VALUE AT 2 MARCH 2006 173.0 4.5 177.5 LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 57 10 GOODWILL continued The annual impairment review for goodwill for 2006 has been conducted using the allocation of goodwill subsequent to the re-segmentation.
However, the annual impairment review conducted in 2005 has been conducted on the basis of the allocation of goodwill and segmentation of the Groups units as at 27 February 2005.
Impairment of Goodwill In assessing whether a write-down of goodwill is required in the carrying value of the related asset, the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount for each CGU and collectively for groups of CGUs that make up the segments of the Groups business, has been measured based on value-in-use, with the exception of those units that were held for sale at the balance sheet date, where the recoverable amount for these units has been based on fair value less costs to sell.
For the purposes of the annual impairment review, the recoverable amount for each of the Groups segments has been estimated on the following bases: Dancing and Entertainment: Value-in-use.
Non-Core: Value-in-use, or fair value less costs of sale for those CGUs held for sale at the balance sheet date.
The Group estimates the value-in-use of its CGUs using a discounted cash flow model DCF, which adjusts the cash flows for risks associated with the assets, and are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 11.5%, 2005: 11.5%.
The discount rate used is consistent across all segments.
The value-in-use calculations have not included the benefits arising from any future asset enhancement expenditure, as this is not permitted by IAS 36.
The value-in-use calculations therefore exclude the significant benefits anticipated from future refurbishments, together with the related capital expenditure, resulting from the re-branding programme.
The growth rates included within the assumptions supporting the value-in-use calculations do not therefore represent the Groups anticipated total forecast growth, but rather the growth deriving from refurbishments completed by the balance sheet date.
Fair value less costs to sell has been based on external offers received for CGUs held for sale, or valuations from internal and external property experts if no offers have been received to date.
During the years ended 2 March 2006 and 27 February 2005, following the annual impairment review required by IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, a goodwill write-down of 33.7m 2005: 4.9m has been recognised.
This charge has been recognised 15.7m 2005: 2.0m through administrative expenses, 3.3m 2005: nil through exceptional items relating to closed properties and 14.7m 2005: 2.9m through exceptional items within discontinued operations.
Of the goodwill impairment, 24.1m 2005: 4.7m relates to the Non-Core segment, and 9.6m 2005: 0.2m to the Entertainment segment.
The impairment recognised within the Non-Core segment has arisen from the remeasurement of those units held for sale to their fair value less costs of sale.
The impairment relating to the Entertainment segment, specifically Jumpin Jaks units, has arisen from downward revisions to prior estimates of value-in-use following sales performance in the segment during the current year.
Goodwill allocated to the Dancing Segment Goodwill allocated to the Dancing segment is significant in comparison to the total carrying value of the Groups goodwill.
The key assumptions required for the value-in-use calculation for the Dancing division are sales growth, EBITDA and decay rates resulting from the exclusion of future refurbishment expenditure from the value-in-use VIU, in accordance with IAS 36.
The Group has only used formally approved budgets for the first year of its VIU calculation.
The use of longer term budgets and forecasts within the VIU would include both the outflows and benefits relating to future capital expenditure, which is not permitted by IAS 36.
As a result, the VIU for years two to five have been based on forecast sales and EBITDA growth decline which the Group anticipates will arise as a result of the exclusion of future refurbishment expenditure from the VIU, rather than formally approved budgets.
The growth rates assumed for EBITDA growth in years two to five range between 5% and -5%.
A terminal value, assuming a 0% growth rate due to no refurbishment benefits assumed in the VIU, has been calculated from estimated year five cash flows.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the VIU for the Dancing segment have been derived from past experience.
It is estimated that if EBITDA for the Dancing segment were to decline by 5% annually, this would not be sufficient to reduce the excess of the recoverable amount over the carrying amounts of the CGUs to zero.
As a result, management believe that no reasonably possible change in assumptions would cause the carrying amount of Dancing goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 58 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2 MARCH 2006 11 ACQUISITION OF BUSINESS On 18 November 2005 the Group acquired the assets and trade relating to 13 units, of which 10 are large capacity clubs, from the Nightclub Company UK Ltd, for a total cash consideration of 11.0m.
The assets acquired in the business combination are outlined below: Book Value Adjustment Fair value m m m NON-CURRENT ASSETS Property, plant and equipment 1.3 1.3 Intangible assets 0.3 0.3 CURRENT ASSETS Inventory 0.3 0.4 0.7 Prepayments 0.5 0.5 Cash 0.1 0.1 2.2 0.7 2.9 GOODWILL 8.1 11.0 CONSIDERATION Cash paid 11.0 The adjustments to the net book value of assets relate to the recognition of acquired intangible assets at their fair value and the step-up of inventory to its fair value less costs of disposal.
The goodwill of 8.1m relates to the development potential on the future re-branding of the acquired units.
The acquired units contributed 5.8m to revenue and 0.7m to operating profit before exceptional items since acquisition.
These units have been allocated to the Dancing segment.
Net cash paid on acquisition of business of 10.9m on the face of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement is net of 0.1m cash acquired with the business.
It is impracticable for the Group to obtain reliable information concerning revenue and results of the acquired business for the period prior to acquisition.

23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As outlined in the principal accounting policies on page 39, the Group has taken the exemption not to restate comparatives for the implementation of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Comparative information for the year ended 27 February 2005 has been presented as previously under UK GAAP, with the exception of finance leases which have been recognised in the comparative period in accordance with IAS 17, Leases.
If comparative information for the year had been restated to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39, the main areas impacted would have been in accounting for the Groups interest rate swaps at their fair value.
The effect of the implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is treated as a change in accounting policy with effect from 28 February 2005.
The effect of the change was to reduce both net assets and retained profits by 0.3m 0.5m recognising interest rates swaps at their fair value, net of a deferred tax asset of 0.2m, and is included in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity.
Due to the predominately cash-based nature of the Groups operations, the only financial instruments that materially expose the Group to any of the financial risks detailed in the notes below are debt financing and related interest rate swaps, and the disclosures to follow relate principally to these items.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to reduce its exposure to financial risk.
The use of such financial instruments constitutes an integral part of the Groups funding strategy.
The Group manages its derivative financial instrument credit risk by only undertaking transactions with relationship banks holding good credit ratings.
Such transactions are governed by Board policies and procedures.
Further details regarding the Groups financial risk management policies can be found within the Financial Review on pages 15 and 16.
A INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities was: Fixed rate weighted average Floating Floating Interest Time Fixed rate rate Total interest rate rate period m m m % % Years 2006 142.1 45.0 187.1 4.6 5.5 3.3 2005 143.0 45.0 188.0 5.9 5.5 4.2 Included within the above is 135.0m 2005: 135.0m of notional principal amounts in relation to four interest rate swaps.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps note 23 D was estimated by the finance providers based on market conditions at the year end.
The values were calculated using their valuation models with mid-market rates.
The floating rate borrowings bear interest at rates based on LIBOR for periods of between one month and six months.
All four swaps matured on 26 April 2006.
Subsequent to the year end, the Group has taken out three interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 60.0m.

The bank loans can be repaid by the Group upon giving 10 working days notice.
However, the facility is committed for a term up to December 2009 unless the Group contravenes covenant arrangements.

ii Drawings made under the Groups floating rate facility, where fair value approximates to book value.
iii Cash at bank, including short-term deposits: all deposits made are for short durations less than one month : therefore, given the short maturity periods, there is no significant difference between the book value and fair value of these deposits.
iv Finance lease liabilities at fixed rate: given the length of time to maturity of these liabilities and the length of time since inception of the lease, the fair value of these liabilities at the balance sheet date is lower than current book value.
v The fair value of interest rate swaps has been determined with reference to market rates at the balance sheet date.
At 2 March 2006 the book value of these swaps equates to their fair value as these derivatives are stated at their fair value under IAS 39.
LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 65 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued E HEDGES ON FUTURE TRANSACTIONS The Groups policy is to manage interest rate risk by using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The unrecognised losses on interest rate swaps as at 27 February 2005 are disclosed in note 23 D. Following the implementation of IAS 39 during the year to 2 March 2006, these interest rate swaps are held within liabilities at their fair value.
These interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39: therefore, changes in their fair value are recorded through the Consolidated Income Statement.

LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2 MARCH 2006 25 PROVISIONS continued ONEROUS LEASES Provisions for onerous leases represent onerous commitments on operating leases for properties currently vacant or for closed units, where assignment of the lease or sub-let of the property is unlikely in the short term.
Provision is made for rent and related property costs for the period management estimate the property would not be sub-let, or until assignment of the lease is probable, and ranges up to 8 years.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment, if this represents the least cost to exit from the commitment.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows relating to onerous leases are subject to variations.
In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows management utilise the skills and experience of both internal and external property specialists, and are satisfied that the resulting estimated provision is appropriate.
PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE Provision for Public Liability Insurance is made for the estimated exposure of the Group to claims in excess of current insurance reserves, based upon experience of historical claims.
This provision is expected to be utilised within 2 years.
OTHER PROVISIONS Other provisions represent redundancy costs associated with the relocation of the Groups head office of 0.2m, and costs associated with various legal proceedings of a type typical to the Groups business of 0.6m, and are expected to be utilised within 12 years.
26 DEFERRED TAX m At 28 February 2005 59.1 Transfer from held for sale 1.5 Credit recognised in income statement 12.9 Credit recognised in equity 0.2 Credit associated with disposal of business 0.6 AT 2 MARCH 2006 43.9 The analysis of the year end deferred tax position is as follows: 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m On property, plant and equipment 42.7 50.2 Other temporary differences 1.2 8.9 43.9 59.1 Deferred taxation provided for in the accounts at the year end represents provision at 30% on the temporary differences between the accounting net book amount of property, plant and equipment, and the tax base of those assets.
The deferred tax liability has been calculated using estimates based on the current manner of recovery of the assets value on property, plant and equipment not eligible for capital allowances, i. e. recovery through continued use in the business unless the asset is held for sale.
This method assumes no tax relief will be available: therefore, no tax base is available for inclusion within the calculation of the deferred tax liability, unless the assets value is recovered through sale rather than continued use.
The key assumptions in the calculation of deferred tax are set out below: Capital expenditure: The percentage of the Companys capital expenditure that would qualify for tax relief, incurred by each unit, has been estimated based on prior periods historical experience of the split between qualifying and non-qualifying expenditure.
Impairments: The impairments to property, plant and equipment have been apportioned between assets qualifying for tax relief and those that do not.
Depreciation: The rate of depreciation for assets that do not qualify for the initial recognition exemption has been estimated based on actual data for the most recent accounting periods.
LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 67 26 DEFERRED TAX continued A review of the deferred tax liability will be performed at each balance sheet date and adjustments made in the event of a change in any key assumptions.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has estimated unused capital gains tax losses of 20m available for offset against future taxable profits from capital disposals.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams available to offset these losses.

DEFERRED BONUS PLAN Additional potential issues of ordinary shares may arise under the terms and conditions of the Deferred Bonus Plan, as described in note 28.
28 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group has followed the transitional arrangements within IFRS 2, Share-based payment, and has adopted the exemption from full retrospective application of all share-based payment awards, and has only applied the measurement requirements of IFRS 2 to awards made after 7 November 2002.
However, the following disclosures include all share-based payment awards, therefore including those equity-settled awards granted prior to 7 November 2002.
The Group operates the following share-based payment plans: A DEFERRED BONUS PLAN In March 2004 the shareholders approved the establishment of the Deferred Bonus Plan the Plan, which seeks to incentivise, retain and reward Executive Directors.
Under the terms of the Plan, 50% of the bonus entitlement of Executive Directors is deferred, being credited to the purchase of notional shares in the Company within the Plan.
The earliest vesting of notional shares awarded under the Plan is three years after the crediting of the notional holding.
Any dividends accrued on the notional shares are accrued to the benefit of the Executive Directors.
The Company will award matching shares, based on the shareholder return of the Company relative to the FTSE 250 Index over the relevant three year period.
Initial awards will vest after 3 years and are dependent on the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The settlement of benefits accruing under the Plan is in equity or cash, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Accounting for the Plan has assumed that awards will be equity-settled.
Awards will not vest unless the Executive Director remains in the service of the Company, unless in exceptional circumstances.
LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 69 28 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued B 1996 EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME & 1999 COMPANY SHARE OPTION PLAN Options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are granted to senior employees at the market price of the Companys ordinary shares, determined by the average of the mid-market price of one ordinary share on the three days preceding the date of grant.
The options vest between three to ten years following grant date.
Options will not vest unless the employee remains in the service of the Company, and that the relevant performance conditions are met, being that normalised EPS growth must exceed RPI plus 3% compounded over a three year period.
All options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are equity-settled.
Awards will not vest unless the Executive remains in the service of the Company, unless in exceptional circumstances.
C NORTHERN LEISURE 1998 EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME ROLLED OVER OPTIONS Options granted under the Northern Leisure scheme are granted to holders of existing Super Options of Northern Leisure Plc, who have elected to release these in exchange for an equivalent option over Luminar plc shares.
The options vest from three to ten years from grant date of the original Super Options.
All options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and accordingly are excluded from the scope of IFRS 2.
D SAYE SCHEME Options granted under the all-employee Save-As-You-Earn scheme are available to all Executive Directors and employees with over one years service, with options granted at the prevailing market rate, with no discount given on grant.
Options are exercisable three years after the date of grant, with options exercisable for an 18 month period following the earliest vesting date.
If the employee does not withdraw savings from the plan, all options are equity settled.
E WARRANT SCHEME On 22 February 1999 the shareholders approved the establishment of a discretionary Trust to hold warrants as part of incentive arrangements under 1 which they are subsequently allocated to employees.
Each warrant carried the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at the price of 6.67 2 per share.
Performance criteria attached to the warrant scheme were met in full in February 2002, and an allocation of 50% of the warrants was made by the Trustee in May 2002.
The remaining warrants are allocable in the absolute discretion of the Trustee who may call for guidance from the Remuneration Committee.
The subscription period in the approved scheme provides that warrants may be exercised in the period of 28 days following the publication of the Annual Report of each financial year up to the year ending on or around 1 March 2009.
F JOOLS HOLLAND The options granted are exercisable five years after the date of grant, and are exercisable for a six month period thereafter, if Mr Holland is still involved with the Group and the Jam House brand at vesting date.
All options granted to Mr Holland will be equity-settled.

Goodwill amortisation of 12.9m charged in the year to 27 February 2005 has therefore been reversed for IFRS reporting.
Following a transitional and annual impairment review, impairment charges of 4.7m and 4.9m have been recorded at 29 February 2004 and in the year ended 27 February 2005 respectively.
b Under IAS 38, software not integral to the operation of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset rather than as property, plant and equipment as under UK GAAP.
A balance sheet reclassification of 1.1m at 29 February 2004 and 1.0m at 27 February 2005 has therefore been recorded on transition to IFRS.
c Following the provisions of IAS 36, the Group has recognised an impairment charge of 21.9m at transition after testing all individual cash generating units for impairment because of a market capitalisation trigger.
In the year ended 27 February 2005, impairment charges of 9.3m recognised under UK GAAP, and depreciation charges of 0.9m, have subsequently been reversed as a result of the recognition of the transitional impairment under IFRS.
Further GAAP differences within property, plant and equipment relate to the classification of software see b, lease premiums see d, assets relating to properties held under finance leases see f, and incremental depreciation of 2.4m for the year ended 27 February 2005 following a review of residual values at transition date as required by IAS 16. d Under IAS 17, premiums paid to acquire leasehold properties are recorded as other non-current assets and not as property, plant and equipment as under UK GAAP.
A reclassification adjustment of 11.6m and 11.2m at transition and 27 February 2005 has therefore been made to classify these assets as other non-current assets.
These premiums still have to be charged to the income statement over the life of the lease: however, under IFRS this charge is classified as rental expense not depreciation, with a consequential reduction of EBITDA by 0.4m when reporting under IFRS.
e Under IAS 10, dividends proposed are not classified as liabilities until the period in which they are approved and authorised as a result the liabilities recognised under UK GAAP at transition and in the balance sheet as at 27 February 2005 of 6.5m and 7.1m respectively have been reversed.
f Under IAS 17, the property element of certain of the Groups leases have been classified as finance leases.
A liability and the related asset have been recognised on balance sheet, and rental expense replaced with a depreciation charge on the asset and finance costs on the liability.
g Following the provisions of IAS 17, incentives received to enter leases are recognised as income over the life of the lease, rather than to the first rent review date as under UK GAAP.
As a result, additional deferred income of 5.0m at transition and 27 February 2005 has been brought back on balance sheet.
h As a result of the recognition of certain of the Groups leases as finance leases see f above, provisions for onerous lease commitments relating to the property element of leases now classified as finance leases have been reversed.
i As a result of the implementation of IAS 12, deferred tax has been recognised on temporary differences between the tax base cost and the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
Under FRS 19, deferred tax was recognised on all timing differences expected to reverse in the future.
An additional liability of 46.8m as at transition date, and 41.9m as at 27 February 2005, has therefore been recognised on adoption of IAS 12. j Following impairments of goodwill and property, plant and equipment as a result of the implementation of IFRS see a and c above, the Group has transferred those losses relating to units acquired through the Northern Leisure acquisition to the merger reserve.
A merger reserve adjustment has also been recorded to transfer to the merger reserve losses in respect of the impairment of Northern Leisure units recognised under UK GAAP in the periods to 29 February 2004 and 27 February 2005 respectively.
k On adoption of IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a charge of 0.2m for the year ended 27 February 2005 in respect of share-based payment arrangements granted subsequent to 7 November 2002.
Under UK GAAP, the intrinsic value of these awards was nil, as the market value of the shares equated to the option price as at the date of grant: therefore, no charge was previously recognised within the Groups UK GAAP financial statements.
