Items excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns represent primarily the effects of altered investment market conditions short-term fluctuations, actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes, and exceptional items, including goodwill impairment.
For EEV, the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns figure also excludes the mark to market value movements on core borrowings, the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the time value of the cost of options and guarantees.
