Other non-recurring income includes a 6.9m settlement in the Companys main dened benefit pension scheme liabilities offset by 3.1m of associated costs resulting from the pension liability management programme.
The impact of the Slate accounting irregularities on the Groups income statement for the year to 31 December 2006 and on its balance sheet as at 31 December 2006 were as follows: Sales fraud resulting in a reduction in reported 2006 Group revenue and pre-tax profit of 9.1m 2005: 7.7m and 22.9m cumulatively, of which 5.4m represents deferred income which will be recognised in 2007.
A reduction of 17.6m in the current assets of the Group, as reected in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2006, in respect of the impairment of the value of stock and work in progress.
This results in a charge to the income statement of 6.9m in 2006 2005: 3.7m.
A reduction of 9.5m in the xed assets of the Group, as reected in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2006, principally in respect of the overstatement of quarry development costs.
This results in a charge to the income statement of 1.8m in 2006 2005: 1.6m.
A one-off cost of 6.0m reecting the costs of the independent investigation and the costs of completing the arrangement of new banking facilities with the Groups bankers.

At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of 98.5m 2005: 102.4m available for off-set against future profits.
This is made up of 0.8m 2005: 2.1m of income losses and 97.7m 2005: 100.3m of capital losses.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of nil 2005: 1.3m of income losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be off-set.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date there was an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 1.7m 2005: 1.7m in respect of ACT recoverable.
In March 2007, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28%, effective from 1 April 2008.
Additionally, it was proposed that Industrial Building Allowances will be phased out over three years.
This could potentially have an impact on the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
However, the current position is uncertain and further guidance from HMRC is anticipated.

In the Directors opinion the underlying EPS provides a more meaningful view of the Groups underlying operating performance.
Goodwill 2006 2005 m m Cost At 1 January 155.5 148.8 Recognised on acquisition of a subsidiary see note 27 6.7 At 31 December 155.5 155.5 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Directors consider the operating segments to be the lowest aggregation for cash ows and are therefore appropriate CGUs.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2006 2005 m m Business Services 80.8 80.8 Infrastructure Services 68.0 68.0 Project Services 6.7 6.7 155.5 155.5 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates applied.
Discount rates are estimated by management using post-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
Consequently the Group post-tax discount rate of 7.6% 2005: 7.6% has been applied to each CGU that is not considered to be exposed to a materially different level of risk.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management for the next three years where the growth rates applied are based on industry growth forecasts.
The forecast cash ow position is extrapolated based on an estimated growth rate of 2.25% 2005: 2.25%.
This rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the relevant markets.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.

Minerals relate to slate reserves and were valued at 11.3m at 3 May 2005.
The Directors are of the opinion that the fair value at 31 December 2006 is materially the same as that at 3 May 2005.
At 31 December 2006, the book value of minerals includes 11.3m 2005: 11.3m which relates to mineral reserves carried at valuation.
Had these assets been carried at historical cost less any impairment losses, their carrying amount would have been approximately 2.4m 2005: 2.4m.
The revaluation surplus, which is not distributable, is disclosed in note 23.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to nil 2005: nil.

Interests in joint ventures and associates A list of the significant investments in associates and joint ventures, including the name, country of incorporation, proportion of ownership interest is given in note 5 to the Companys separate financial statements.
The Group has investments in joint ventures established to provide long-term services to Government agencies as part of the Private Finance Initiative PFI, which it accounts for using the equity method.
The Groups share of the joint ventures revenue, profits, current and long-term assets and current and long-term liabilities is included below: 2006 2005 m m SHARE OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES Restated Current assets 50.2 52.1 Long-term assets 185.9 186.0 Total assets 236.1 238.1 Current liabilities 6.0 8.6 Long-term liabilities 191.0 198.9 Total liabilities 197.0 207.5 Total net assets 39.1 30.6 Revenue 18.2 53.2 Expenses 15.5 38.0 profit before interest and tax 2.7 15.2 During the year management has changed the accounting for a contract within Infrastructure Services from equity accounting as a Joint Venture to contract accounting which was deemed to be more appropriate.
Therefore, the 2005 gures have been restated to be on a consistent basis.
The impact of this change on the 2005 gures is an increase in Group turnover of 41.1m, an increase in Group gross profit of 3.7m and a decrease in share of post tax profits from Joint Ventures of 3.7m.
There is no impact on profit before tax.
In addition, there is a reallocation in the cash ow statement of 3.7m from dividends received from joint ventures to cash generated from operations.
There is no impact on net cash.
The liabilities of the associate and joint venture investments are without recourse to the Group.
The Group has a commitment to invest 3.8m in relation to Addenbrookes Hospital 2005: 3.8m.

It has been determined that it is more appropriate to account for service contracts within Infrastructure Services under IAS 18 rather than IAS 11.
Therefore, the 2005 gures have been restated to be on a consistent basis which results in a balance sheet reclassication only.
The impact was to move 69.2m from amounts due from contract customers to prepayments and accrued income and 2.4m from payments received on account to accruals and deferred income.

The amount provided represents the best estimate of obligations under completed contracts and other costs and is expected to be utilised over the period to 31 December 2010.
Pension costs Dened contribution pension schemes The Group operates six main dened contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The amount contributed by the Group is charged to the income statement as the contributions fall due.
The total amount charged to the income statement in respect of dened contribution schemes was 4.9m 2005: 4.1m.
Dened benefit pension schemes The Group currently operates or participates in four dened benefit pension schemes.
These are the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan the Plan which was the primary scheme for employees before it was closed to future service accrual from 31 July 2003, the ESPS scheme of which a number of Infrastructure Services employees are members, and two small local government schemes relating to contracts operated by Infrastructure Services.
Each scheme is administered by its own trustees, the funds being independent of the Groups nances.
Under the schemes, employees are entitled to retirement benets varying according to their age at retirement, service and salary.
No other post-retirement benets are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.

Awards made under the LTIP 2005 are normally able to vest following the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing, and is subject to the Company achieving specic performance targets.
A description of these schemes and the terms of conditions of each scheme are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 38.

The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The expected vesting life is the average expected period to exercise.
The forfeiture rate has been based on the numbers of options forfeited within each scheme over the last three years due to the impacts of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Financial instruments The Groups approach to managing exposures to interest rate, currency and liquidity risks are set out in the financial risk management section of the Accounting Policies on page 49.
Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than deferred consideration, receipts on account, shared equity debtors and the currency risk disclosures.
Allowances are made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale goods and services of 1.1m 2005: 1.8m as determined by reference to past default experience.
Fair values Other than the preference shares, the book value of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date approximated to their fair value.
The book value of the preferences shares was 4.5m 2005: 4.5m compared with a fair value based on market value of 6.1m 2005: 6.4m.
The fair value of the Groups bank loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the loans are oating, with payments reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of short-term deposits, cash and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of other financial assets approximates to the carrying amount because of the ongoing trading nature of these items and the effect of increasing expected recovery offsetting the effect of discounting.
The fair value of other financial liabilities reects the discounting of the liabilities at an effective rate of interest of 5%.

Financial instruments continued In addition to the above, the Groups provisions of 0.3m 2005: 0.6m for vacant leasehold properties note 19 meet the denition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities are considered to be oating rate financial liabilities as, in establishing the provisions, the cash ows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised at each half-yearly reporting date to ensure that it reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the liability.
The average interest rate for preference shares in both 2005 and 2006 was 9%, for finance leases it was 4.9% in 2006 2005: 5.0% and for other xed rate liabilities 6.0% 2005: 6.0%.
This is xed for an indefinite period for the non-redeemable preference shares and for a weighted average period of 4.6 years 2005: 4.4 years for other xed rate liabilities.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on relevant LIBOR equivalents, which are xed in advance for periods up to three months.
The weighted average period until maturity of financial liabilities on which no interest is paid is 6.6 years 2004: 2.0 years.
The preference shares have the following rights: a a xed cumulative preference dividend of 9% per annum payable half yearly on 30 April and 31 October: b they rank with regard to dividend including any arrears to the commencement of a winding up and return on capital in priority to ordinary shares.
On a return of assets on liquidation or reduction in capital, there is a premium entitlement calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the articles of association but no further right to participate in the profits or assets: c there is no redemption entitlement: and d where any preference dividend is in arrears, holders are entitled to attend any general meeting, with the right to vote on a show of hands or by poll, with one vote for each share held.
