To prevent this independence being compromised policies are in place regarding the provision of non-audit services, and the hiring of former external audit staff.
In line with best practice, the Audit Committee undertook a tender of the external audit contract in early 2006.
Following a rigorous review process, it was agreed to recommend the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the groups external auditor for the year ending 31 March 2007.
A resolution to this effect will be put to shareholders for approval at the upcoming AGM.
The policy on non-audit services prohibits the use of the external audit firm for specified services.
It is considered appropriate, for commercial and practical reasons, including confidentiality, to use the external auditors for certain non-audit services.
These permissible services are set out in the policy and have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee up to an initial fee value of 100,000 per assignment.
Permissible services that are not listed in the policy require to be pre-approved individually by the Audit Committee or its Chairman: any assignments that exceed the fee limit must be reviewed and authorised by the Committee Chairman and the Finance Director.
For the year ended 31 March 2006, of the total audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditors of 7.0 million 2005 6.3 million, 4.5 million 2005 5.6 million was charged to operating profit and 2.5 million was charged against the gain on disposal of PacifiCorp 2005 0.7 million was included in the cost of acquisitions.
For the year ended 31 March 2006, fees for Further assurance services and Tax advisory services principally relate to services provided in connection with the disposal of PacifiCorp and the capital reorganisation and return of cash to shareholders.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, fees for Further assurance services principally relate to due diligence work on acquisitions and advice regarding the implementation of s404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the implementation of IFRS.

This operation was classified as a disposal group held for sale and a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 as of that date.
The disposal was completed on 21 March 2006, on which date control of PacifiCorp passed to MidAmerican.
The results of the discontinued operation for the period to 20 March 2006 and year ended 31 March 2005, which have been included in the Group Income Statement, are as follows: 2006 2005 Notes m m Revenue 2,498.9 2,250.9 Fair value gains on operating derivatives 64.6 Depreciation and amortisation a 32.1 216.2 Exceptional item impairment of goodwill b 922.0 Other net operating costs 1,721.8 1,500.0 Operating profit loss 809.6 387.3 Net finance costs c 178.3 66.7 Profit loss before tax 631.3 454.0 Attributable tax expense 214.7 149.7 Profit loss after tax from discontinued operations 416.6 603.7 Exceptional item gain on sale of PacifiCorp e 619.4 Profit loss for the period year 1,036.0 603.7 a The depreciation and amortisation charge for the period to 20 March 2006 of 32.1 million represents the depreciation and amortisation charged for the period until 23 May 2005.
Under IFRS 5, non-current assets held for sale are not subject to depreciation or amortisation and, therefore, the above results did not include charges of 190.8 million in relation to depreciation and amortisation for the period from 24 May 2005 to 20 March 2006. b In November 2004, the Board began a strategic review of PacifiCorp as a result of its performance and the significant investment it required in the immediate future.
In May 2005, the Board concluded that in light of the prospects for PacifiCorp, the scale and timing of the capital investment required and the likely profile of returns, shareholders' interests were best served by a sale of PacifiCorp and a return of capital to shareholders.
As a consequence, the group undertook a review of the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the PacifiCorp reporting segment as at 31 March 2005.
The estimated recoverable value was based on net realisable value, with reference to the price of comparable businesses, recent market transactions and the estimated proceeds from disposal.
This resulted in an exceptional charge, in the year ended 31 March 2005, for impairment of goodwill of 922.0 million.
c An analysis of net finance costs is given below: 2006 2005 m m Interest charge 174.5 158.7 Interest receivable 20.6 9.5 Net interest cost on retirement benefit obligations 3.8 5.9 157.7 155.1 Other finance items allocated to discontinued operations: Fair value losses on financing derivatives 13.5 Interest rate differential 39.0 88.4 Loss following fide-designation of net investment hedges 46.1 20.6 88.4 Net finance costs 178.3 66.7 Net finance costs include the UK US interest rate differential benefit of 39.0 million 2005 88.4 million arising from the groups US dollar hedging programme relating to PacifiCorps net assets for the year ended 31 March 2006.
This programme has terminated following the sale of PacifiCorp on 21 March 2006. d The cash flows of the discontinued operation, which have been included in the Group Cash Flow Statement, are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Net cash from operating activities discontinued operations 569.9 404.6 Net cash used in investing activities discontinued operations 420.3 471.3 Net cash used in provided by financing activities discontinued operations 253.3 150.1 Net decrease increase in net cash and cash equivalents discontinued operations 103.7 83.4 94 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 9 Discontinued operations continued e The gain on sale of PacifiCorp is analysed as follows: 21 March 2006 Notes m Intangible assets goodwill 854.2 other intangible assets 215.4 Property, plant and equipment 5,424.3 Investments 172.4 Other non-current assets 128.3 Current assets 530.8 Current liabilities 749.4 Non-current liabilities 3,907.0 Book value of PacifiCorp net assets disposed 2,669.0 Book gain on sale pre-tax i 122.5 Net disposal proceeds 2,791.5 Satisfied by: Cash received for net assets 2,911.4 Cash expenses 26.2 Net disposal cash proceeds ii 2,885.2 Accrued expenses 74.3 Impairment of assets iii, 17 19.4 Net disposal proceeds 2,791.5 i The gain on sale of PacifiCorp comprises: Book gain on sale pre-tax 122.5 Tax credit on sale iv 12.3 Cumulative translation gains realised on sale transferred from equity 33 484.6 Gain on sale of PacifiCorp 619.4 ii The book gain on sale excludes cash outflows of 116.7 million relating to the settlement of certain treasury derivative financial instruments following the sale of PacifiCorp, which had previously been marked-to-market.
iii PPM Energy has leased a power plant to PacifiCorp since 2002.
As part of the final settlement achieved with MidAmerican on completion of the sale of PacifiCorp, the group agreed to a reduction in lease rentals receivable by PPM Energy from PacifiCorp in respect of this lease.
As a consequence of this reduction in lease rentals, an impairment of 19.4 million has been charged against the gain on sale.
Other sale expenses cash and accrued of 100.5 million principally comprise legal and other professional fees of 37.8 million and a provision of 32.9 million for royalties payable to MidAmerican.
iv The disposal of PacifiCorp gives rise to a net taxable capital loss for the group which is offset against other taxable capital gains made in the current year.
As a result the gain on sale has benefited from a tax credit of 12.3 million.
f The operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for PacifiCorp for the year ended 31 March 2005 under UK GAAP on the previous segmental basis was 541.7 million.
The operating profit, as adjusted for exceptional items and contracts now within the scope of IAS 39, of PacifiCorp for the year ended 31 March 2005 under IFRS on the revised segmental basis was 534.6 million.

iii On 24 May 2005, the intangible assets relating to the PacifiCorp disposal group were reclassified as Assets classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. iv Goodwill of 8.0 million arose on the groups acquisition of the remaining 50% of Core Utility Solutions Limited, which became a 100% subsidiary of the group.
v Additions and disposals in the Other category in the year ended 31 March 2006 are in respect of emissions allowances.
vi Amortisation of 8.1 million is included in Cost of sales in the Group Income Statement: 12.5 million in Transmission and distribution costs and 11.9 million in Administrative expenses.
b Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three individual cash-generating units - Rye House power station, Katy gas storage facility and Core Utility Solutions Limited.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to Rye House power station 82.2 million is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill 100.8 million.
The recoverable amount of Rye House power station has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on a financial business plan covering a ten-year period, and a discount rate of 13.5% pre-tax.
A business plan covering a ten-year period has been used due to the long-term nature of the business.
Cash flows beyond that period have been extrapolated using a steady 2.5% growth rate which results in no growth in real terms beyond the financial business plan period.
The value-in-use calculation also takes into account the extrinsic value of the power station as calculated by a widely recognised option pricing model.
The extrinsic value of the station represents the additional value of the station from the capture of short-term volatilities in the electricity, natural gas and carbon markets.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which Rye House's recoverable amount is based would not cause Rye House's carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations Basis for determining values assigned to key assumptions Growth rate beyond period covered by business plan 2.5% nominal, 0% real Use of a 0% real growth rate is derived from past experience and future expectations for the station Discount rate pre-tax 13.5% Discount rate is determined on the basis of market data and the divisional cost of capital Forward price of underlying commodities used to calculate extrinsic value Market quotes management future expectations Volatility of underlying commodities used to calculate extrinsic value Market quotes historical analysis Correlations of underlying commodities used to calculate extrinsic value Historical analysis ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 101 Accounts 2005 06 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2006 17 Property, plant and equipment Land and Plant and Vehicles and buildings machinery equipment Total Year ended 31 March 2005 m m m m Cost: At 1 April 2004 595.4 9,714.8 717.0 11,027.2 Additions 23.8 849.3 70.6 943.7 Acquisitions 13.1 439.1 452.2 Disposals 3.0 92.7 59.2 154.9 Exchange 4.5 140.9 13.2 158.6 At 31 March 2005 624.8 10,769.6 715.2 12,109.6 Depreciation: At 1 April 2004 181.7 2,004.3 349.6 2,535.6 Charge for the year 16.6 296.6 84.5 397.7 Disposals 2.0 76.4 55.3 133.7 Exchange 0.6 19.2 5.1 24.9 At 31 March 2005 195.7 2,205.3 373.7 2,774.7 Net book value: At 31 March 2005 429.1 8,564.3 341.5 9,334.9 At 1 April 2004 413.7 7,710.5 367.4 8,491.6 Land and Plant and Vehicles and buildings machinery equipment Total Year ended 31 March 2006 Notes m m m m Cost: At 1 April 2005 624.8 10,769.6 715.2 12,109.6 Discontinued operations Additions for the period to 23 May 2005 4.5 70.0 7.7 82.2 Disposals for the period to 23 May 2005 4.7 5.7 1.5 11.9 Transferred to assets classified as held for sale on 24 May 2005 a 150.5 4,881.2 402.8 5,434.5 474.1 5,952.7 318.6 6,745.4 Continuing operations Additions 11.6 846.8 48.3 906.7 Acquisition 1.2 1.2 Disposals 3.3 67.6 31.4 102.3 Exchange 0.3 45.9 6.1 52.3 At 31 March 2006 482.7 6,779.0 341.6 7,603.3 Depreciation: At 1 April 2005 195.7 2,205.3 373.7 2,774.7 Discontinued operations Charge for the period to 23 May 2005 0.4 22.1 5.9 28.4 Disposals for the period to 23 May 2005 0.1 0.8 0.4 1.3 Transferred to assets classified as held for sale on 24 May 2005 a 8.1 662.7 183.2 854.0 187.9 1,563.9 196.0 1,947.8 Continuing operations Impairment 9 19.4 19.4 Charge for the year 11.7 167.4 37.0 216.1 Disposals 1.0 50.7 21.4 73.1 Exchange 1.0 0.6 1.7 3.3 At 31 March 2006 199.6 1,700.6 213.3 2,113.5 Net book value: At 31 March 2006 283.1 5,078.4 128.3 5,489.8 At 1 April 2005 429.1 8,564.3 341.5 9,334.9 2006 2005 Included in the cost of property, plant and equipment above are: Note m m Assets in the course of construction 562.0 779.7 Other assets not subject to depreciation b 83.2 135.0 a On 24 May 2005, property, plant and equipment relating to the PacifiCorp disposal group was reclassified as Assets classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. b Other assets not subject to depreciation are land.

These payments include interest charges allocated to future years of 18.0 million.
As disclosed in Note 20 c to the groups Annual Report & Accounts 2004 05.
Weighted average interest rates in the analysis above take into account the effect of interest rate swaps and currency swaps used to convert underlying debt into sterling and the effect of price hedging.
i Bank overdrafts and uncommitted short-term borrowings For short-term borrowings overdrafts and uncommitted bank loans the book value approximates the fair value because of their short maturities.
ii Medium-term notes private placements Scottish Power plc and Scottish Power UK plc have an established joint US$7.0 billion euro-medium-term note programme.
Scottish Power plc has not yet issued under the programme.
Paper is issued in a range of currencies and swapped back into sterling.
As at 31 March 2006, maturities range from 1 to 34 years.
The fair value of those medium-term loans placements as at 31 March 2006 has been calculated as 955.1 million.
The fair value has been calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows at the appropriate market discount rate.
Some of those notes total value of 300.0 million contain a Loss of licences covenant that will require repayment of the outstanding amount should the UK group lose all of its electricity licences distribution, transmission and supply licences.
The notes can be redeemed by the group with 30 to 90 days notice in case of unfavourable and unavoidable change in the UK tax laws impacting on the note payments.
"iii European Investment Bank ""EIB"" loans These loans incorporate agreements with various interest rates and maturity dates."
The maturity dates of these arrangements range from 2009 to 2011.
The fair values of the European Investment Bank loans at 31 March 2006 have been calculated by discounting their future cashflows at market rates adjusted to reflect the redemption adjustments allowed under each agreement.
iv Variable rate Australian dollar bond 2011 The bond has been issued by Scottish Power UK plc.
The bond's fair value at 31 March 2006 has been estimated using quoted market prices converted at the spot rate of exchange as appropriate.
"The bond contains a ""Loss of licences"" covenant that will require repayment of the entire debt should the UK group lose all of its electricity licences distribution, transmission and supply licences."
The bond contains an early redemption option where the group can choose to repay the principal amount and accrued interest at any time by giving 30 to 90 days notice to the lender.
"108 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 24 Financial liabilities continued v US dollar convertible bonds Scottish Power Finance Jersey Limited ""the issuer"" has issued US$700 million 4% step-up perpetual subordinated convertible bonds guaranteed by Scottish Power plc."
The bonds are convertible into redeemable preference shares of the issuer which will be exchangeable immediately on issuance for ordinary shares in Scottish Power plc.
The Exchange Price was initially set at 4.60 but will be subject to change on the occurrence of certain events set out in the Offering Circular, including payments of dividends greater than amounts set out in the bond agreement, capital restructuring and change of control.
Subsequent to 31 March 2006 and, as a result of the return of cash to shareholders, the Exchange Price has been adjusted to 4.544.
The exchange rate to be used to convert US dollar denominated preference shares into sterling is 1.6776.
Conversion of the bonds into shares is at the option of the bondholders.
During the period up to 3 July 2011, they can opt to convert the bonds into preference shares of the issuer which are immediately exchangeable into ordinary shares of Scottish Power plc.
If the bonds remain outstanding after 10 July 2011, they will bear interest at the rate of 4% per annum above the London Interbank Offer Rate for three month US dollar deposits.
The bonds are perpetual, so there is no fixed redemption date.
There are, however, occasions where redemption may occur.
The issuer may redeem the bonds: i if, after 10 July 2009, for the preceding 30 dealing days the average of the middle market quotations of any ordinary share has been at least 130% of the average Exchange Price: ii if, at any time, conversion rights have been exercised and or purchases effected in respect of 85% or more in principal amount of the bonds: or iii at any time after 10 July 2011, provided all the outstanding bonds are redeemed.
Under ii and iii, the redemption amount will be principal value plus accrued, unpaid interest.
Under i, the redemption will be by way of issue of shares.
The bondholders may require redemption if an offer is made to the shareholders of Scottish Power plc to buy their shares in the company.
The redemption amount will be principal value plus accrued, unpaid interest.
The fair value of the liability component of these bonds has been estimated by discounting the related future cash flows at a market rate.
The derivative component relating to the conversion option of this bond has been valued and is accounted for within Derivative Financial Instruments on the balance sheet.
The bond also contains a Loss of licences covenant that will require repayment of the entire debt should the UK group lose all of its electricity licences distribution, transmission and supply licences.
In the light of evolving practice, the group has changed the classification of its convertible bonds from Non-current liabilities to Current liabilities and restated comparative figures accordingly.
The bonds are perpetual and have no fixed redemption date: although they can be redeemed in limited circumstances.
Bondholders can convert into ordinary shares of Scottish Power plc at any time and, therefore, the bonds meet the definition of current liabilities in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and the IASBs Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.
vi Deutschmark bond The bond has been issued by Scottish Power UK plc.
The bond contains an early redemption option where the group can repay it with 30 to 90 days notice in case of unfavourable and unavoidable change in the UK tax laws impacting on the bond payments.
vii Euro-sterling bonds These are quoted euro bonds with various maturities.
Their fair values at 31 March 2006 are based on their quoted closing clean market price converted at the spot rate of exchange as appropriate.
"The bonds also contain a ""Loss of licences"" covenant that will require repayment of the entire debt should the UK group lose all of its electricity licences distribution, transmission and supply licences."
The bonds also contain early redemption options where the group can repay them with 30 to 90 days notice in case of an unfavourable and unavoidable change in the UK tax laws impacting on the bond payments.
The sterling bond due 2017 can also be redeemed at any time by the group at the higher of principal amount or Redemption Price as determined by Midland Bank plc on giving 30 to 90 days notice to the lender.
In a similar way the sterling bond due 2023 can be redeemed on giving 30 to 45 days notice at the higher of principal amount or Redemption Price.
viii US dollar 4.0 billion US shelf registration In March 2005, Scottish Power plc established a US$4.0 billion US shelf registration for the issuance of debt and other securities.
An inaugural issue of $1.5 billion of bonds was made during March 2005.
These bonds were split into three maturities of 5, 10 and 20 years, with respective notional values being $550 million, $600 million and $350 million.
The bonds fair value at 31 March 2006 has been estimated using quoted market prices converted at the spot rate of exchange as appropriate.
ix Commercial paper Scottish Power UK plc has an established US$2.0 billion 2005 US$2.0 billion euro-commercial paper programme.
Paper was issued in a range of currencies and swapped back into sterling.
As at 31 March 2005, PacifiCorp had a $1.5 billion domestic commercial paper programme.
No issues are outstanding under the Scottish Power UK plc programme or have been made under this programme since April 2002.
As at 31 March 2005, PacifiCorp had borrowings of 248.0 million under its commercial paper programme.
Amounts borrowed under commercial paper programmes are repayable in less than one year.
There was no commercial paper outstanding as at 31 March 2006. x Pollution control revenue bonds These were bonds issued by qualified tax exempt entities to finance, or refinance, the cost of certain pollution control, solid waste disposal and sewage facilities.
As at 31 March 2005, PacifiCorp had entered into agreements with the issuers pursuant to which PacifiCorp received the proceeds of the issuance and agreed to make payments sufficient to pay principal of, interest on, and certain additional expenses.
The interest on the bonds was not subject to federal income taxation for most bondholders.
In some cases, PacifiCorp issued first mortgage and collateral bonds as collateral for repayment.
xi Finance leases These are facility leases that were accounted for as capital leases, maturity dates range from 2014 to 2022. xii Other unsecured borrowings The book value of other unsecured borrowings equates to their fair value because of their short maturities.
xiii First mortgage and collateral bonds First mortgage and collateral bonds of PacifiCorp may be issued in amounts limited by its Domestic Electric operation's property, earnings and other provisions of the mortgage indenture.
A floating charge at 31 March 2005 over approximately US$13.1 billion of the eligible assets based on original costs of PacifiCorp was used as collateral for PacifiCorp's first mortgage and collateral trust bonds.
xiv Other secured borrowings Included within other secured borrowings is ScottishPower's share of debt in a joint arrangement for the Klamath Co-Generation plant.
The borrowings of the joint arrangement are the subject of a guarantee, for US$60.0 million, provided by Scottish Power Holdings Inc. formerly PacifiCorp Holdings Inc. in respect of second lien revenue bonds.
The fair value of those borrowings is 83.7 million.

Floating rate borrowings bear interest at rates based on LIBOR, certificate of deposit rates, interbank borrowing rates, prime rates or other short-term market rates.
The average interest rate on short-term borrowings as at 31 March 2006 were as follows: GBP 4.7%, USD 4.8% 2005 4.7% and 2.9% respectively.
e Borrowing facilities The group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2006 in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met.
The facility was renegotiated on 20 December 2005.
All facilities are floating rate facilities.
The ability to draw on these facilities is governed by certain covenants relating to the performance of the group relative to its interest and dividend payments as well as the groups gearing.
None of these covenants have been breached in the course of the year or at the year end.

ii The fair values of all quoted euro bonds are based on their closing clean market price converted at the spot rate of exchange as appropriate.
iii The fair values of the EIB loans have been calculated by discounting their future cash flows at market rates adjusted to reflect the redemption adjustments allowed under each agreement.
iv The fair values of unquoted debt have been calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows for each instrument at the appropriate market discount rate in the currency of issue in effect at the balance sheet date.
v The fair values of the sterling interest rate swaps and sterling forward rate agreements have been estimated by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows.
vi The fair values of the sterling interest rate swaptions are estimated using the sterling yield curve and implied volatilities as at 31 March 2005. vii The fair values of the cross-currency swaps have been estimated by adding the present values of the two sides of each swap.
The present value of each side of the swap is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows for that side, using the appropriate market discount rates for that currency in effect at the balance sheet date.
viii The fair values of the forward contracts are estimated using market forward exchange rates on 31 March 2005. ix The fair values of electricity and gas forwards and futures are estimated using market forward commodity price curves as at 31 March 2005. x The fair values of weather derivatives have been estimated assuming for water related derivatives a normal water year in several water basins, and for temperature related derivatives, a normal daily high temperature of certain cities in the US.

The transactions included in the table above consist of forward purchase and sale contracts of electricity and forward purchase and sale contracts of gas and gas futures contracts.
These contracts were marked to market value using externally derived market prices and any gain or loss arising was recognised in the profit and loss account.
h Currency exposures Information required under UK GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2005 relating to currency exposure is set out below.
The group uses forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies to mitigate the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Other than the transactions referred to above, the group did not hold material net monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than functional currency at 31 March 2005.
112 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 25 Hedging and derivative instruments Hedging activities are undertaken by the group to manage risk exposure in three main areas: Energy Market Risk, Credit Risk and Treasury Management.
Energy Market Risk The group is exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in the market price of electricity and generation fuel compounded by volumetric risk caused by unplanned changes in the load and output of its portfolio of generation assets.
The risk management policies are implemented at the business level with the oversight of the businesses Risk Management committees.
The businesses which are exposed to and therefore undertake activities to manage energy market risk are Energy Retail & Wholesale and PPM Energy.
Energy Retail & Wholesale Energy Retail & Wholesales hedging activities associated with energy market risk are undertaken within the Energy Wholesale function.
The strategy of the business is to mitigate the economic risks associated with electricity generation, purchase of fuel and supply of electricity and natural gas to end users in both the wholesale and retail markets and also to optimise the value of the asset portfolio.
From a reporting perspective the objective is to report earnings results that are consistent with its operational strategies and hence recognise the earnings effect of financial and non-financial derivative transactions executed to hedge economic business risks in the same period in which the hedged operational activity impacts earnings.
The aim is to minimise earnings volatility, which would otherwise be present as a result of fair valuing all derivative contracts under IAS 39.
To achieve this objective, where effectiveness documentation and reporting requirements are met, cash flow hedge accounting is applied by designation of a series of derivative trades and deferring in equity the fair value changes of open derivative positions until the period in which forecast transactions occur.
A number of contracts do not qualify for own use or hedge accounting under IAS 39 and are therefore wholly or partially fair valued through the income statement.
Cash flow hedging strategies are developed for each of the electricity, natural gas and coal portfolios to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with changes in the market price of each commodity.
Forward fixed price fixed volume contracts are designated as hedging instruments in the power and gas hedges, and financial swaps are designated in the coal hedge.
The electricity hedge is in relation to a long-term electricity procurement contract where volumes purchased are based on floating prices, thereby exposing the business to cash flow variability.
The cash flows on this contract are expected to occur until March 2011.
The gas and coal hedges relate to the cash flow variability associated with purchases of natural gas and coal at floating prices that are required to meet forecast demand for each commodity.
Forecast demand is based on existing customer numbers and historic profiles of demand at levels that are highly probable of occurring.
The associated cash flows extend until December 2010 for gas and December 2008 for coal.
The assessment of effectiveness of all hedging relationships currently in place is carried out on a monthly basis as part of the financial reporting cycle.
Prospective assessment is carried out at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to verify that the forecast is still highly probable of occurring.
Retrospective assessment is also carried out to assess the effectiveness in the period under review.
Prospective and retrospective assessment is performed using statistical analysis and the business can apply the hedge accounting rules prescribed by IAS 39 if the hedging relationship passes the criteria of a three-step regression test.
Hedge effectiveness is measured and respective entries recorded in the balance sheet, reserves and income statement on a monthly basis.
PPM Energy PPM Energy undertakes hedging activities to mitigate the economic risks associated with the purchase, transportation, and storage of natural gas.
The instruments utilised for economic hedging include: Fixed price financial basis and index swaps for natural gas European-style call and put options for natural gas and electricity American-style call and put options for natural gas Forward fixed price electricity contracts Under IAS 39 the business has designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability of cash flows resulting from changes in the market price of gas for quantities of natural gas injected purchased and withdrawn sold from storage and to reduce volatility of earnings.
PPM Energy designates forward gas purchase and sale contracts into the gas storage hedging portfolio.
The actual injections and withdrawals of gas from storage occur continuously and the associated cash flows occur on a monthly basis.
Credit Risk The group is exposed to both settlement risk defined as the risk of a counterparty failing to pay for energy and or services which have been delivered, as well as replacement risk defined as the risk of incurring additional costs in order to replace a sale or purchase contract following a counterparty default.
Credit risk is mitigated by contracting with multiple counterparties and limiting exposure to individual counterparties to clearly defined limits based upon the risk of counterparty default.
Aggregated portfolio risk is monitored and reported by credit risk indices simulations to quantify the value at risk within the existing portfolio.
With the exception of retail customers, the group considers that 100% of its credit risk can be considered to be with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions operating in energy markets.
At the counterparty level the group employs specific eligibility criteria in determining appropriate limits for each prospective counterparty and supplements this with netting and collateral agreements including margining, guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits where appropriate.
Counterparty exposures are then monitored on a daily basis.
ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 113 Accounts 2005 06 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2006 25 Hedging and derivative instruments continued Treasury Management Within the Treasury function the group utilises a number of financial instruments to manage interest rate, foreign currency and value of net investment exposures.
The following hedging strategies are currently in place: Cash flow hedges Hedging of forecasted interest payments on debt instruments issued by the group: Currently the interest payable on a loan with the European Investment Bank is being hedged to protect the group from variability of cash flows resulting from changes in the interest rates to which the payments are linked.
Those payments are designated in a cash flow hedging relationship and are expected to occur quarterly up to the maturity of the loan in 2010.
An interest rate swap has been designated as a hedging derivative instrument.
Hedging of forecast interest payments on debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies: The group utilises loans denominated in EUR and in USD.
Details on those loans are disclosed in Note 24.
The interest payments which the group makes on those debts are subject to cash flow risk arising from changes in the EUR and USD exchange rates.
Payments are occurring on a quarterly or semi-annual basis up to the maturities of the loans, which extend to 2008.
The group has designated cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedges to those interest and principal payments.
Hedging of asset purchases: The group is subject to cash flow risk relating to the value of forecast purchases of various assets such as coal and wind turbines which are denominated in foreign currencies.
The risk being hedged relates to changes in the foreign exchange rate of the forecast purchase price.
The group enters into forward foreign exchange rate contracts to hedge those risks.
Fair value hedges Hedging the value of issued sterling debt: The group has issued a number of medium-term loan notes at fixed interest rates.
Those have been designated in a hedging relationship with floating for fixed rate swaps as the hedging derivatives.
The objective of this hedging strategy is to protect the value of the groups fixed loan notes from changes as a result of fluctuations of the market interest rates.
Hedging the value of cross currency debt: The group has issued debt instruments denominated in EUR, JPY, USD and AUD.
The value of the groups liability with respect to those instruments is subject to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
As a result the group has entered into cross-currency swaps as hedges and has designated those within a fair value hedging relationship.
Net investment hedges ScottishPower hedges a proportion of the value of its net investments in its US operations.
The risk being hedged is risk of changes in the value of the share of net assets in those operations due to fluctuations of the USD exchange rate.
The instruments designated as hedges in the net investment portfolio are cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward USD contracts as well as debt issued in USD.
Other hedging strategies Hedge assessment for all of the treasury hedging relationships currently in place is done on a quarterly basis.
Assessment is done prospectively to verify that the forecast transactions are still highly probable of occurring for cash flow hedges as well as retrospectively, to assess the effectiveness in the period under review.
Retrospective assessment is performed using the dollar offset approach which compares the change in fair value of the hedging instrument within the hedged item.
The changes in fair value of the hedging derivative instruments are compared to the changes in fair value of the hedged items to assess whether a high level of correlation exists between those changes.
An effectiveness test result between 80 and 125% means that the group can apply the hedge accounting rules prescribed by IAS 39.
Hedge effectiveness is measured and respective entries recorded in the balance sheet, reserves and income statement on a quarterly basis.
Treasury instruments are valued using quoted market prices only.
Swaps and forward agreements are valued against the appropriate market-based curves.
Forward price curves are developed using market prices from independent sources for liquid markets and products.
No illiquid markets or products are used.

i Included in this category is the embedded derivative within the 4% US$ convertible bonds.
For further details see Note 24 c v. ii Included within this category are derivative contracts which are traded in active markets and for which published market price and rate information is available for the whole contract term.
iii This category principally includes commodity purchase contracts which extend over liquid and illiquid periods.
The liquid periods for power and gas extend to March 2008 and June 2009, respectively.
Fair values for these contracts have been calculated utilising forward price curves for illiquid periods which have been developed internally using various models and assumptions that are intended to simulate expected market price levels.
Given the proportionately small element of these contracts that falls within the illiquid period, any range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions applied to power and gas prices is unlikely to have a significant impact on contract fair values.
For indicative purposes, a 1% movement in commodity prices in the illiquid period would result in an approximately 1.2 million impact on reported fair values.
The weighted average term for the commodity trading portfolio is 1.8 years.
The maximum term of any contract is 10.5 years.
The weighted average term of the treasury trading portfolio at year end is 3.8 years.
The weighted average term of the hedging derivative instruments is 3.6 years.
The maximum term of any contract is 24 years.

In accordance with IAS 39 the excess gain loss has been recorded in the income statement classifed as Fair value gains on operating derivatives.
Refer to Note 1 d. ii This is the impact on the income statement of amounts valued using models and valuation methods as described in Note 25 f. iii These amounts relate to the loss following fide-designation of net investment hedges arising from the group's US dollar hedging programme relating to PacifiCorp's net assets on 1 April 2005.
Refer to Note 9 c. iv The adjustments relate to the change in fair value of the financial fixed and floating ISDA swaps entered into to hedge the fair value of the coal stock held by the group and a change in fair value of the cross-currency and interest rate swaps entered into to hedge the fair value of foreign currency and sterling debt.
v The adjustments relate to a change in fair value of the coal stock held by the group as well as a change in the fair value of foreign currency and sterling denominated debt, which have been designated as hedged items in fair value hedging relationships.
vi The charge for the year relates to amortisation of previously recorded movements in the fair value of hedged items designated in fair value hedging relationships.
vii The amount relates to gains and losses on the effective portions of cash flow hedges which have previously been deferred in equity which have been transferred to the income statement in the current year to match timing of occurrence of the hedged cash flows or where hedged forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur.
The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are dealt with in i above.
b Comparative information The group has taken exemption under IFRS 1 from applying the standards IAS 32 and IAS 39 to the comparative period.
The comparatives relating to hedging and derivative instruments for the year ended 31 March 2005 are presented below under UK GAAP in accordance with the disclosure requirements of FRS 13 Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments.
Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

Of the total charge, 18.4 million relates to payments made to the companys pension schemes and this amount has been transferred to retirement benefit obligations.
The provision was expected to cover the costs of a reduction of employee numbers through redundancies of 356 from 2005 06 onwards, with the balance of the positions to be eliminated through the corporate restructuring being achieved through redeployment and attrition.
At 31 March 2006 the group had made redundancy payments under the restructuring to 73 employees.
b The environmental and health provisions at 31 March 2005 principally comprised the costs of notified environmental remediation work and constructive obligations in respect of potential environmental remediation costs identified by an external due diligence review in the US.

New shares issued to satisfy options and awards under all share plans represented 3.75% of the issued share capital, leaving available dilution headroom of 6.25%.
v Share option pricing For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the stock-based compensation charge, the Binomial model or the Monte Carlo option pricing models have been used, as appropriate.
The assumptions used in the models were as follows: Binomial Model Monte Carlo model 2006 2005 2006 2005 Dividend yield 6.3% 6.6% 4.9% 5.3% Risk-free interest rate 4.1% 5.0% n a n a Volatility 20.8% 24.3% 15.3% 14.4% Expected life of the options years 1-5 1-5 3 3 Binomial model The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years and the risk-free interest rate is the yield on UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Monte Carlo model The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last two years.

126 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 35 Retirement benefit obligations a Group pension arrangements Following a review of the groups UK pension arrangements, the ScottishPower Final Salary LifePlan and the ScottishPower Executive Top-Up Plan were merged with the ScottishPower Pension Scheme as at 31 March 2006.
This will lead to economies of scale in relation to the ongoing running costs in the delivery of the pension benefits due to the groups current and past staff.
From 1 April 2006 new entrants will have access to a defined contribution Stakeholder Pension Plan.
The merged ScottishPower Pension Scheme and the Manweb Pension Scheme are closed to new entrants.
In the UK pension arrangements the age profile of the two closed defined benefit schemes is expected to rise over time, due to the lack of new entrants.
This will in turn result in increasing service costs for these two schemes due to the method of actuarial valuation used the projected unit method.
The group believes that the projected unit method is appropriate when adopted across all schemes closed and open, and in aggregate provides a reasonable basis for assessing the group's pension costs.
As a result of the proposed return of cash to shareholders and capital reorganisation on the sale of PacifiCorp, ScottishPower reached agreement with the trustees of the UK Pension schemes to make special contributions to each scheme in order to fund the deficit as at 31 December 2005 in respect of each scheme over a period of up to 5 years.
ScottishPower made an aggregate lump sum payment of 28.2 million during March 2006 into the relevant schemes.
On completion of the return of cash to shareholders, an aggregate lump sum contribution of 100.0 million will be made to the relevant schemes and four further aggregate annual payments of 13.2 million will be made to the relevant schemes commencing on 31 March 2007, subject to a deficit continuing in those schemes at each due payment date.
ScottishPower has received a clearance statement from the Pensions Regulator, that it would not be reasonable to impose liability for a contribution notice on the applicants to the clearance application in respect of the proposed return of cash.
Each of the pension schemes are invested in an appropriately diversified range of equities, bonds, property and private markets.
The broad proportions of each asset class in which the schemes aim to be invested are as follows, however it is important to note that this may vary from time to time as markets change and as cash may be held for strategic reasons.
Private Equities Bonds Property markets Total %% %%% ScottishPower 66 26 8 100 Manweb 60 40 100 Final Salary LifePlan 100 100 US pensions 58 35 7 100 US other post-retirement benefits 64 35 1 100 In broad terms, the investment strategies adopted by the schemes aim to ensure that sufficient assets are available to meet scheme liabilities as they fall due.
The ScottishPower and Manweb schemes' investment strategies reflect the large and growing proportion of their liabilities which relate to pensions in payment and therefore include a growing bond element.
A significant equity element is still retained, however, to provide potential for long-term outperformance relative to bonds and therefore to reduce the group's contribution requirements.
This strategy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the trustees and they will continue to seek the companys views and comments on asset allocation.
US arrangements are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA and the Internal Revenue Service IRS revenue code.
The ERISA is the US legislation which regulates pension institutions in a number of areas.
The US arrangements employs an investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximise the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition.
The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
Equity investments are diversified across US and non-US stocks, as well as growth, value, small and large capitalisation.
Fixed income investments are diversified across US and non-US bonds.
Other assets such as private equity are used judiciously with a view to enhancing long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
The US arrangements primarily minimises the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset liability studies.
ScottishPower Scottish Power UK plc operates a funded pension scheme of the company providing defined retirement and death benefits based on final pensionable salary.
This scheme was open prior to 1 January 1999 to employees of ScottishPower.

The assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Scheme assets no longer include any ScottishPower shares.
For funding and expensing purposes the Scheme assets are taken at market value plus a smoothing adjustment appropriate at the valuation date.
The pension charge for the year is based on advice from an independent qualified actuary.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year ranged between 8.1% and 14.1% for different sections of membership but tending towards the higher rates, or other rates for particular groups or as required by a business transfer agreement.
The rates of contributions payable have been reviewed following the results of the formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2004.
The contributions payable have been increased, principally by a lump sum payment paid in March 2005 of 26.8 million.
As described above, as a result of the return of cash to shareholders following the sale of PacifiCorp, the company agreed an enhanced funding plan with the trustees, a 13.4 million lump sum payment was paid in March 2006 and, on completion of the return of cash to shareholders, a further 82.0 million lump sum payment will be paid to the scheme.
Four annual payments of 11.2 million will be made to the scheme commencing on 31 March 2007, subject to a deficit continuing in those schemes at each due payment date.
Final Salary LifePlan Up until 31 March 2005 the assets of the LifePlan were held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The pension charge for the year is based on the advice of the LifePlans independent qualified actuary, representing the assessed balance of cost of the accruing benefits after allowing for members contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries.
The same actuarial assumptions have been adopted for both funding and expensing purposes.
The Final Salary LifePlan closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2006.
A seperate Stakeholder Pension Plan was established for new entrants from 1 April 2006.
Future service benefits within the Final Salary Life Plan were also changed from that date.
Most significantly, the Normal Retirement Age was increased from 63 to 65 and pension increases in payment were reduced from the increase in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 5% p. a. to a maximum of 2.5% p. a.
From 1 April 2006 the LifePlan benefits will be provided from the LifePlan section of the merged ScottishPower Pension Scheme.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year were 15% of pensionable salaries, except where required by a business transfer agreement.
US arrangements The US businesses operate pension plans covering substantially all their employees.
Benefits are based on the employees years of service and final pensionable salary, adjusted to reflect estimated social security benefits.
Pension costs are funded annually by no more than the maximum amount which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
The US businesses pension figures in these Accounts include the unfunded SERP.
The SERP accounts for less than 5% of the US businesses liabilities.
The US businesses meet the entire cost of accruing benefits under the US businesses plans.
The assets for the funded Plan are held in a separate fund.
For funding and expensing purposes, the Plan assets are valued at market levels, and liabilities costed on financial assumptions in line with market return expectations.
In March 2006 the regulated business, PacifiCorp was sold by ScottishPower, with ScottishPower retaining the US non-regulated businesses.

Expected return on scheme assets 6.5% p. a.
For the UK pension arrangements, the long-term rates of return have been derived as follows: Equities: the long-term UK Government fixed interest stock yield, plus 3.5% p. a.
Bonds: an appropriate weighted average of long-term UK Government and UK corporate bond yields reflecting the actual split of holdings.
Property: the long-term equities rate of return less 1% p. a.
Cash: the current UK base rate of interest.
In all cases, for IAS 19 reporting purposes the long-term rates of return have been reduced by 0.3% p. a.
2004 0.3% p. a. to reflect scheme expenses to arrive at the figures shown above.
For the US pension and other post-retirement healthcare arrangements, the long-term rates of return have been derived as follows: Equities: An expected real return of 6.25% plus 3% long-term inflation.
Bonds: An expected real return of 3.50% plus 3% long-term inflation.
Private markets: An expected real return of 11% plus 3% long-term inflation.
These return assumptions are based on both historical performance and independent advisors' forward-looking views of the financial markets.

This gave rise to a contingent liability to corporation tax on chargeable gains, estimated at amounts up to 570 million.
On 19 March 2002, the group demerged its residual holding in Thus Group plc the new holding company of Thus plc.
The charge referred to above could still arise, in certain circumstances, before 19 March 2007.

the Group Accounts continued for for the the ye year ended 31 Marc ar ended 31 March 2 h 200 006 6 42 Reconciliation of previously reported financial statements under UK GAAP to IFRS continued d Reconciliation of the group cash flow under UK GAAP to IFRS as at 31 March 2005 The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with FRS 1 Cash flow statements presents substantially the same information as that required under IFRS.
Under IFRS, however, there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash flows were presented separately for operating activities, dividends received from joint ventures and associates, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and financing.
Under IFRS, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under IFRS, items which under UK GAAP would have been included within management of liquid resources fall within the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
The requirements of IAS 38 state that certain non-current assets, namely capitalised software and hydro relicensing costs, previously included within tangible assets, are reclassified as intangible assets.
This has resulted in 54.6 million being reclassified from the purchase of property, plant and equipment to the purchase of intangible assets.
A further 1.2 million has been reclassified from the purchase of property, plant and equipment to the proceeds from the sale of intangible assets.
IFRIC 4 contains guidance on the identification of lease arrangements.
The groups arrangements have been assessed against the criteria contained in IAS 17 to determine, firstly, whether any arrangements qualify for lease accounting and, secondly, whether the leases should be categorised as operating or finance leases.
The identification of additional finance leases has resulted in 11.7 million being reclassified from cash generated from operations to interest paid 8.8 million and proceeds from borrowings 2.9 million.
e Notes to income statement reclassifications Certain income statement items previously reported under UK GAAP have been reclassified to comply with the format of the group Accounts as presented under IFRS.
The reclassifications below do not have any effect on the groups previously reported net income.
i IAS 28 31 Associates jointly controlled entities The groups share of the operating profit, interest and tax of associates and jointly controlled entities has been combined and disclosed on one line as share of profits of jointly controlled entities and associates in accordance with IAS 28 and IAS 31. ii IAS 17 Leases Net income in relation to finance leases in the US of 2.9 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been reclassified from revenue to finance income 33.3 million and finance costs 30.4 million in accordance with IAS 17.
Under UK GAAP, these were accounted for on a net cash investment basis and qualified for linked presentation under FRS 5. f Notes to balance sheet reclassifications Certain balances, previously reported under UK GAAP, have been reclassified to comply with the format of the groups Accounts as presented under IFRS.
None of these reclassifications have any effect on the groups previously reported net assets or shareholders funds.
i IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Trade and other receivables falling due after more than one year of 18.7 million at 31 March 2005 2004 35.3 million, previously reported as part of Current assets, have been reclassified and included within Non-current assets.
Finance lease receivables falling due after more than one year of 80.8 million at 31 March 2005 2004 82.5 million, previously reported as part of Current assets, have been reclassified and included within Non-current assets.
Finance lease receivables due within one year of 7.3 million at 31 March 2005 2004 12.3 million, previously included within Trade and other receivables, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Provisions for liabilities and charges due within one year of 80.1 million at 31 March 2005 2004 84.7 million, previously presented within Non-current liabilities, have been reclassified and shown within Current liabilities.
Obligations under finance leases of 14.0 million at 31 March 2005 2004 15.0 million, previously presented within Loans and other borrowings, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
In light of evolving practice, the group has changed the classification of its convertible bonds from Non-current liabilities to Current liabilities and restated comparative figures accordingly.
The bonds are perpetual and have no fixed redemption date: although they can be redeemed in limited circumstances as set out in Note 24.
ii IAS 12 Income taxes Current corporate tax balances of 338.9 million at 31 March 2005 2004 237.7 million, previously included within Trade and other payables falling due within one year, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
iii IAS 19 Employee benefits Pensions and other post-retirement benefits of 133.8 million at 31 March 2005 2004 152.1 million, previously included within Provisions for liabilities and charges and Trade and other payables, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Although this separate presentation is not required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits, this presentation has been adopted in view of the significance of these balances as accounted for under IAS 19. iv IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates Cumulative exchange gains and losses of 484.6 million at 31 March 2005 2004 484.6 million, net of related hedging gains and losses and taxation, are required by IAS 21 to be shown as a separate reserve.
These were previously included within retained earnings.
Under IAS 21, all monetary items are required to be separately measured and presented at the closing balance sheet rate whereas UK GAAP permitted the use of the exchange rate specified in the contract.
As a result, foreign currency debt is translated at the closing exchange rate and the groups related derivatives have been separately presented on the balance sheet rather than disclosing the net hedge position that existed under UK GAAP.
At 31 March 2005, derivatives showing a gain of 37.5 million 2004 42.7 million and 11.6 million 2004 0.4 million have been included within Non-current and Current trade and other receivables respectively.
Those derivatives showing a loss of 2.7 million 2004 17.6 million and 17.9 million 2004 nil have been reclassified from Loans and other borrowings and included within Non-current and Current trade and other payables respectively.
140 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 42 Reconciliation of previously reported financial statements under UK GAAP to IFRS continued v IAS 38 Intangible assets Certain Non-current assets at 31 March 2005, being capitalised software of 238.6 million 2004 260.9 million and hydro relicensing costs of 62.5 million 2004 45.6 million, previously included within Tangible assets have been reclassified as Intangible assets as required by IAS 38. vi IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRS The revaluation reserve of 39.7 million at 31 March 2005 2004 41.6 million, previously recognised in respect of the revaluation of the group's Manweb distribution assets has been reclassified to retained earnings.
IFRS permits previously revalued tangible assets to be recognised at deemed cost at the date of the groups transition to IFRS.
The group has applied this exemption in preparing its balance sheet in accordance with IFRS.
The group has elected not to take advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption to reset the translation reserve to zero at the date of the transition.
g Notes to IFRS remeasurements The IFRS remeasurements do not include any adjustments for IAS 32 and IAS 39 which have been applied by the group from 1 April 2005 in accordance with the exemptions set out in IFRS 1 see Note 43. i IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Dividends in respect of the groups ordinary shares declared after the balance sheet date are not accrued in the balance sheet as required by IAS 10.
Previously, under UK GAAP, such dividends were accrued in the balance sheet.
ii IAS 12 Income taxes Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is provided based on timing differences, whilst IFRS has a wider scope and requires deferred tax to be provided on temporary differences.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, additional deferred tax has been provided on the temporary difference arising on acquisitions where the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value differ to their tax base.
iii IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment The group calculates its depreciation charge in respect of property, plant and equipment based on cost less estimated residual values at current prices as required by IAS 16.
Previously, under UK GAAP, the group calculated its depreciation charge for property, plant and equipment based on cost or revalued amounts less estimated residual values at prices prevailing at the time of the initial recognition of the asset or subsequent revaluation.
iv IAS 17 IFRIC 4 Leases The group has finance leases where it acts as a lessor and funds these through non-recourse debt.
Under UK GAAP, these were accounted for on a net cash investment basis and qualified for linked presentation whereby the non-recourse debt was offset against the receivable in accordance with FRS 5.
Under IFRS, such leases are required to be accounted for as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and, unlike FRS 5, there is no concept of linked presentation in relation to non-recourse debt.
The effect of this adjustment is to present separately a finance lease receivable of 86.5 million 2004 106.3 million and 88.5 million 2004 109.4 million of nonrecourse debt.
Income from finance leases for the year ended 31 March 2005 increased by 4.9 million, net of a tax credit of 3.7 million.
IFRIC 4 contains specific guidance on the identification of lease arrangements.
The arrangements have been assessed against the criteria contained in IAS 17 to determine whether the leases should be categorised as operating or financing.
As a consequence, new finance lease arrangements have been recognised on the balance sheet, resulting in the recognition of additional Property, plant and equipment of 48.9 million 2004 54.7 million and additional obligations under finance leases of 70.8 million 2004 75.7 million.
Profit before tax reduced by 1.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2005. v IAS 19 Employee benefits Pensions and other post-retirement benefits have been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
The groups accounting policy for pensions and other post-retirement benefits requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefit arrangements in the income statement.
IAS 19 permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits.
The groups accounting policy is to recognise any actuarial gains and losses in full immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Accordingly, the pension scheme deficits and the obligations relating to other post-retirement benefits are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
Previously, under UK GAAP, the groups policy was to recognise a charge for its defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits in arriving at operating profit.
This cost comprised the regular cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits and a charge or credit relating to the amortisation of actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining service lives of the employees covered by the relevant arrangements.
The difference between the cumulative charge for pensions and other post-retirement benefits and the cumulative contributions paid in respect of those arrangements was previously recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
vi IFRS 2 Share-based payments The groups employee share and share option schemes have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
This requires that a charge be recognised, using a fair value model, for all of the groups share and share option schemes.
Previously under UK GAAP, the group accounted for the cost of certain of its share and share option schemes based on an intrinsic value model.
vii IFRS 3 Business combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill is required to be amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill recognised under UK GAAP at that time was frozen.
No future amortisation will be charged, although an annual review for impairment is required.
Under IFRS 3, the fair values attributed to deferred tax and intangible assets on acquisitions differ from those under UK GAAP.
viii IFRS 5 Discontinued operations As a result of the groups decision to sell PacifiCorp, PacifiCorp has been treated as a disposal group held for sale and a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5.
As a consequence of the classification as a discontinued operation, the net profit of PacifiCorp has been shown in one line in the income statement.
The results of discontinued operations include the UK US interest rate differential benefit and the loss following fide-designation of net investment hedges arising from the groups US dollar hedging programme relating to PacifiCorps net assets and the impact of the US dollar earnings hedges relating to the results of PacifiCorp.
This programme has been terminated following completion of the sale of PacifiCorp on 21 March 2006.

The reconciliation above shows the effect on the IFRS restated balance sheet at 31 March 2005 immediately following the implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005.
142 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 43 Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 April 2005 continued During the preparation of the groups Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2006, the group finalised its IAS 39 transition adjustment as at 1 April 2005.
This resulted in the IAS 39 transition adjustment to equity attributable to equity holders of Scottish Power plc increasing by 16.9 million from 264.5 million to 281.4 million.
The principal adjustments arising from the implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005 were as follows: a In-the-money gas contracts were derecognised as other intangible assets and remeasured and disclosed within derivative financial instruments resulting in a decrease to other intangible assets of 108.4 million.
b Non-current and Current trade and other receivables decreased by 192.4 million principally as a result of treasury net investment hedges previously classified within trade and other receivables being reclassified as derivative financial instruments.
c Current and Non-current trade and other payables decreased by 79.0 million principally as a result of treasury net investment hedges previously classified within trade and other payables being reclassified as derivative financial instruments.
d Deferred tax liabilities increased by 109.6 million being the tax effect of the cumulative IAS 39 adjustments.
e Onerous contracts provisions were derecognised and remeasured and disclosed within derivative financial instruments resulting in a decrease in Non-current provisions of 64.6 million.

Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising from the purchase of operating entities before 31 March 1998 was written off directly to reserves, and, under IFRS, on future disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to equity under a former GAAP will not be charged against income.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions from 1998 was capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life.
On 1 April 2004, amortisation ceased in acccordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations and the asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indicator of impairment.
Any impairment is recognised in the period in which it is identified.
The goodwill adjustment is made to recognise goodwill previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP as an intangible asset under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP following the introduction of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
"142 'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets' ""FAS 142"" which was effective for the group from 1 April 2002, goodwill arising from the purchase of operating entities should be held as an indefinite lived intangible asset and is no longer amortised."
Instead goodwill is subject to an impairment test performed at least annually.
The implementation of FAS 142 two years earlier than the group's transition to IFRS, results in goodwill balances acquired between 31 March 1998 and 31 March 2004 reflecting two years less amortisation under US GAAP than under IFRS.
The group has completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis under FAS 142 as at 30 September 2005 and has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.
The following table provides an analysis of goodwill included in the balance sheet under US GAAP for the years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005.
2006 2005 Note m m Net book value of goodwill capitalised: At 1 April 951.2 2,382.1 Acquisition i 8.0 Impairment 1,381.0 Disposal of PacifiCorp 406.6 Exchange 29.6 49.9 As at 31 March 582.2 951.2 i Goodwill of 8.0 million arose on the group's acquisition of the remaining 50% of Core Utility Solutions Limited, which became a 100% subsidiary of the group.
The table below shows an analysis of goodwill by business: 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 Note m m UK businesses Energy Networks 8.0 Energy Retail & Wholesale 562.9 562.9 United Kingdom total 570.9 562.9 US businesses PacifiCorp 377.9 PPM i 11.3 10.4 United States total 11.3 388.3 Total 582.2 951.2 i Year-on-year movements on the net book value of goodwill capitalised for PPM of 0.9 million relate solely to foreign exchange.
Business combinations The group has elected under IFRS 1 not to restate business combinations accounted for prior to 1 April 2004, the group's date of transition to IFRS.
Accordingly, the adjustment referred to as Business Combinations reflects principally the difference between calculating the goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Manweb and, for 2005, of PacifiCorp under IFRS and US GAAP.
This adjustment is required due to the differences between IFRS and US GAAP in determination of acquisition price and valuation of assets and liabilities at the acquisition date.
In cases where traded equity securities are exchanged as consideration, IFRS requires the fair value of consideration to be determined at the date the transaction is completed, while US GAAP requires the fair value of such consideration to be determined at the date the acquisition is announced.
ii US regulatory net assets FAS 71 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation establishes US GAAP for utilities in the US whose regulators have the power to approve and or regulate rates that may be charged to customers.
FAS 71 provides that regulatory assets may be capitalised if it is probable that future revenue in an amount at least equal to the capitalised costs will result from the inclusion of that cost in allowable costs for ratemaking purposes.
Due to the different regulatory environment, no equivalent GAAP applies under IFRS.
Under IFRS, no regulatory assets are recognised.
All regulatory assets recognised under US GAAP related to PacifiCorp.
Following the disposal of PacifiCorp on 21 March 2006, no regulatory assets are recognised under US GAAP for the continuing business.
Profit under US GAAP is consequently decreased by 30.2 million in 2006 2005 50.1 million.
iii Retirement benefit obligations The fundamental difference between IFRS and US GAAP is the method of recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The group under IFRS recognises actuarial gains and losses in full, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which they occur and are shown in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Under US GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are recognised using the 10% corridor approach and deferred actuarial gains and losses are amortised on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life of employees.
A minimum pension liability is also recognised under US GAAP through comprehensive income when there is a deficit of plan assets relative to the accumulated benefit obligation.
ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 145 Accounts 2005 06 N Notes to the Group Accounts otes to the Group Accounts continued for for the the ye year ended 31 Marc ar ended 31 March 2 h 200 006 6 44 Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued iv Revaluation of fixed assets The revaluation of assets is not permitted under US GAAP.
The reconciling item reflects the revaluation reserve which was reclassed to retained earnings as at the date of the groups transition to IFRS, as previously revalued tangible assets were recognised at deemed cost at the date of the groups transition to IFRS.
The reconciliation therefore adjusts assets to historical cost and the depreciation charge has been adjusted accordingly.
v Decommissioning, environmental and mine reclamation liabilities Under IFRS, future decommissioning and mine reclamation costs are provided for on a discounted basis with a corresponding increase to the cost of the asset.
This increased cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
Under US GAAP, legal obligations associated with decommissioning and mine reclamation costs are accounted for on a similar basis in accordance with FAS 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143.
For other decommissioning and mine reclamation costs, regulated industries rateably accrue these costs and include them within US regulatory net assets, as the costs are recovered in depreciation rates.
Under IFRS, provision is made for both legal and constructive environmental obligations at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, provision is made for legal obligations.
vi Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivative instruments in the normal course of business, to offset fluctuations in cash flows and equity associated with movements in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133, as amended by FAS 138, was adopted by the group with effect from 1 April 2001.
In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS No.
149 Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, FAS 149.
This statement amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.
This statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after 30 June 2003.
In applying this statement, the group began marking-to-market certain transactions that were entered into after 30 June 2003 that, prior to the implementation of FAS 149, would have qualified for the normal purchase and normal sales exemption under FAS 133.
The derivative financial instruments adjustment for the year ended 31 March 2006 represents the difference between accounting for derivative financial instruments under IFRS and US GAAP.
Both IAS 39, the IFRS financial instruments standard, and FAS 133, the US GAAP equivalent, require all derivative financial instruments, as defined by the respective standards, to be fair valued.
Both standards provide specific exemptions to this requirement: however the exemptions allowed are different between the respective standards, giving rise to a GAAP difference.
In addition, a number of differences exist within the hedge accounting rules resulting in a further GAAP difference.
The equivalent adjustment for the year ended 31 March 2005 represented the difference in accounting for derivative financial instruments under the groups former UK GAAP accounting policies for such items which applied until the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 April 2005 and US GAAP.
"Year ended 31 March 2006 The key differences between accounting for derivatives under IFRS, under which the Accounts are prepared, and US GAAP, and in the group's application of their respective requirements, are as follows: Commodity contracts which are a derivative for FAS 133, but not a derivative for IAS 39 for the following reasons: Normal purchase normal sale ""npns"" treatment is an election under FAS 133, whereas under IAS 39, own use accounting is an exemption."
As a result certain contracts are fair valued under FAS 133 but not under IAS 39.
Under FAS 133, a host contract containing an embedded derivative that is not clearly and closely related does not qualify for npns treatment.
Under IAS 39, an embedded derivative that is not closely related can be bifurcated from the host contract, which is then available for own use accounting.
Accordingly under FAS 133 some contracts will be fair valued in their entirety, while under IAS 39 the embedded derivative is bifurcated and fair valued and the host contract qualifies for own use accounting.
Under FAS 133, contracts which deliver at a liquid point where bookouts can occur may not qualify on a net basis not available for the npns election.
Under IAS 39, such contracts may be available for own use accounting if it can be demonstrated that the contract is never settled.
Commodity contracts which are a derivative for IAS 39, but not a derivative for FAS 133.
These contracts met the definition of a capacity contract under FAS 133 DIG C-15 and were available for npns accounting.
This exemption does not exist under IAS 39, and the contracts are instead fair valued.
Certain derivatives which are designated by the group as cash flow hedging instruments under IAS 39 are not designated as hedging instruments under FAS 133.
In addition, treasury derivatives which have been treated as a cash flow hedge under the transition exemptions in the amendment to IAS 39 on Hedging of Forecast Intragroup Transactions, are not available for hedge accounting under FAS 133.
Accordingly, hedge accounting is not applied under US GAAP in respect of these arrangements.
Differences relating to the permissible methods of measuring embedded derivatives cause further GAAP adjustments.
Consequently, under IFRS, the embedded derivative component of the convertible bonds is recorded through the income statement and the debt host component is accounted for as a hedging instrument of the US net investment.
Under US GAAP, the entire bond is measured at fair value through the income statement and is not considered to qualify for hedge accounting.
There are differences in fair value methodology in relation to adjustments for credit risk and the bid ask spread which are required by IAS 39 but not FAS 133.
As a result, contracts with similar accounting under IAS 39 and FAS 133 may have different fair values.
In addition, the effect of changes in certain long-term energy contracts entered into to hedge PacifiCorp's future retail resource requirements, which were being fair valued under both FAS 133 and IAS 39, are subject to regulation in the US and the fair value gains and losses deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities under US GAAP pursuant to FAS 71 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.
No comparable standard exists under IFRS and accordingly no regulatory assets or liabilities were recognised under IFRS in respect of these contracts.
Year ended 31 March 2005 The group exercised the exemption under IFRS 1 to present financial instruments in comparative periods in accordance with UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, substantially all commodity contracts were accruals accounted on the basis that they were entered into for non-speculative purposes.
In addition, under UK GAAP, certain derivative instruments used as hedges were not recognised on the balance sheet and the matching principle was used to match the gain or loss under these hedging contracts to the transaction to which they related.
A number of these commodity contracts and derivative instruments were fair valued under FAS 133. vii Restructuring costs Under IFRS, a present obligation only exists when the entity is demonstrably committed to the restructuring.
The group has in existence a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and is unable to withdraw because it has started to implement the plan and has announced its main features to those individuals affected.
Under US GAAP, similar rules exist but US GAAP prohibits the recognition of a liability based solely on an entitys demonstrable commitment to a plan.
A liability is only recognised when details of the plan have been communicated to, and formally accepted by, the affected employees.

Provision is made based on enacted tax law.
The item Effect of US GAAP adjustments reflects the additional impact of making full provision for deferred tax in respect of adjustments made in restating the balance sheet to US GAAP.
ix Gain on disposal of PacifiCorp On 24 May 2005, the group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of PacifiCorp, the group's former US regulated business.
A reconciliation of the gain on sale from IFRS to US GAAP is given below: 31 March 2006 Notes m Book value of PacifiCorp net assets disposed under IFRS 2,669.0 Business combinations i 194.6 Amortisation of goodwill i 241.3 Impairment of goodwill i 494.3 US regulatory net assets ii 524.1 Retirement benefit obligations iii 172.1 Decommissioning, environmental and mine reclamation liabilities v 76.1 Derivative financial instruments vi 132.4 Other x 0.5 Deferred tax viii 271.9 Book value of PacifiCorp net assets disposed under US GAAP 2,701.5 Book gain on sale under US GAAP pre-tax a 106.6 Net disposal proceeds under US GAAP 2,808.1 Satisfied by: Cash received for net assets under IFRS and US GAAP 2,911.4 Cash expenses under IFRS and US GAAP 26.2 Net disposal cash proceeds under IFRS and US GAAP 2,885.2 Accrued expenses under IFRS 74.3 GAAP adjustment Retirement benefit obligations 2.8 Accrued expenses under US GAAP 77.1 Impairment of assets under IFRS 19.4 GAAP adjustment Other b 19.4 Impairment of assets under US GAAP Net disposal proceeds under US GAAP 2,808.1 a The gain on sale of PacifiCorp under US GAAP is analysed as follows: Book gain on sale under US GAAP pre-tax 106.6 Tax credit on sale 12.3 Cumulative exchange differences realised on sale under IFRS 484.6 GAAP adjustment Gain on disposal 418.6 Cumulative exchange differences realised on sale under US GAAP 66.0 Gain on disposal of PacifiCorp under US GAAP 184.9 Gain on disposal of PacifiCorp under IFRS 9 619.4 GAAP difference Gain on disposal 44 a 434.5 b The impairment of assets, as discussed in Note 9 e iii, is not recognised under US GAAP as the determination of whether or not there is impairment under US GAAP is based on undiscounted cash flows which, in this case, are greater than the asset book value.

Further details in relation to impairment of assets is given in footnote ix.
Under US GAAP, the group applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25 'Accounting for Stock Issued to employees' APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for plans and a compensation expense has been recognised accordingly for its share option schemes.
"As the group applies APB 25 in accounting for its plans, under FAS 123 'Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation' ""FAS 123"", it has adopted the disclosure only option in relation to its share option schemes."
Had the group determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its share options under FAS 123, the group's profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP and earnings loss per share under US GAAP would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts below: 2006 2005 Profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 1,085.4 494.7 Reversal of APB 25 stock compensation expense million 9.7 3.1 Stock compensation expense calculated under FAS 123 million 0.6 5.3 Pro forma profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 1,094.5 496.9 Basic earnings loss per share under US GAAP 58.91p 27.02 p Pro forma basic earnings loss US GAAP profit 59.41p 27.14 p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 58.48p 25.58 p Pro forma diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 58.97p 25.69 p The option pricing model assumptions used to fair value the options granted during the year are given in Note 32 v. xi Reclassifications The reconciliations of profit loss for the financial year and equity attributable to equity holders of Scottish Power plc at the year end from IFRS to US GAAP only include those items which have a net effect on profit or equity attributable to equity holders of Scottish Power plc.
There are other GAAP differences, not included in the reconciliations, which would affect the classification of assets and liabilities or of income and expenditure.
The principal items which would have such an effect are as follows: a under IFRS debt issue costs are deducted from the carrying value of the related debt instrument.
US GAAP requires such costs to be included as an asset.
b under IFRS customer contributions in respect of fixed assets are generally credited to a separate deferred income account.
Under US GAAP such contributions are netted off against the cost of the related fixed assets.
c under US GAAP transmission and distribution costs would be included in cost of sales.
Under IFRS these are included as a separate line item within the income statement.
d the group implemented EITF No.
03-11 Reporting Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments that are Subject to FASB Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Not Held for Trading Purposes EITF 03-11 on 1 January 2004.
EITF 03-11 addresses whether realised gains and losses should be shown gross or net in the income statement for contracts that are not held for trading purposes but are derivatives subject to FAS 133.
This Issue led to a reduction in US GAAP reported turnover from continuing operations of 1,689.7 million 2005 1,058.2 million with an equivalent reduction in cost of goods sold as a result of the netting approach adopted for contracts within the scope of the Issue.
Under IFRS these items are shown on a gross basis within the turnover and cost of sales lines of the income statement.
e Convertible bonds Under IFRS, as described in Note 42 f i, the convertible bonds are classified as current liabilities.
Under US GAAP, the convertible bonds would be classified as a non-current liabilities.
d Consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss Under US GAAP, certain items shown as components of common equity must be more prominently reported in a separate statement as components of comprehensive income loss.
The groups Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, which is the equivalent IFRS primary statement, is set out on page 85. e Doubtful debts The group estimates its provision for doubtful debts relating to trade debtors by a combination of two methods.
Specific amounts are evaluated where information is available that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations.
In these circumstances, assessment is made based on available information to record a specific provision against the amount receivable from that customer to adjust the carrying value of the debtor to the amount expected to be collected.
In addition, a provision for doubtful debts within the portfolio of other debtors is made using historical experience and ageing analysis to estimate the provision required to reduce the carrying value of trade debtors to their estimated recoverable amounts.
This process involves the use of assumptions and estimates which may differ from actual experience.
The continuing group provided 56.1 million, 46.6 million and 26.8 million for doubtful debts in 2005 06, 2004 05 and 2003 04 respectively.
Write-offs against the provision for doubtful debts for uncollectable amounts for the continuing group were 31.6 million, 43.9 million and 45.6 million in 2005 06, 2004 05 and 2003 04 respectively.
On 24 May 2005, 6.7 million of a provision for doubtful debts relating to the PacifiCorp disposal group was reclassified as Assets classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. f Deferred tax The additional components of the estimated net deferred tax liability that would be recognised under US GAAP are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Non-current deferred tax assets liabilities: Excess of book value over taxation value of fixed assets 13.0 20.1 Other temporary differences 2.0 452.5 15.0 472.6 The deferred tax balance in respect of leveraged leases at the year end is 54.6 million 2005 71.0 million.
148 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 44 Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued g Pensions At 31 March 2006, ScottishPower had six statutorily approved defined benefit pension schemes, one statutorily approved defined contribution scheme and one unapproved scheme.
Further details of the arrangements are given in Note 35.
Benefits under the UK defined benefit plans reflect each employees basic earnings, years of service and age at retirement.
Funding of the defined benefit plans is based upon actuarially determined contributions, with members paying contributions at fixed rates and the employers meeting the balance of cost as determined by the scheme actuaries.
Reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of the projected pension benefit obligation and the funded status of these plans for the years ending 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005 are as follows: 2006 2005 Change in projected benefit obligation m m Projected benefit obligation at 1 April 3,169.2 2,926.4 Service cost excluding plan participants contributions 65.3 52.2 Interest cost 171.6 165.7 Plan amendments 0.5 Special termination benefits 18.5 Plan participants contributions 10.4 8.9 Expenses 4.8 Actuarial loss 289.2 189.9 Benefits paid 156.7 154.6 Settlements 0.1 Disposal of PacifiCorp 763.1 Exchange 56.8 19.7 Projected benefit obligation at 31 March 2,856.4 3,169.2 2006 2005 Change in plans assets m m Fair value of plans assets at 1 April 2,681.9 2,484.2 Actual return on plans assets 515.8 266.8 Employer contributions 99.9 89.4 Plan participants contributions 10.4 8.9 Benefits paid 156.7 154.6 Expenses 4.8 Settlements 0.1 Disposal of PacifiCorp 471.6 Exchange 34.2 12.7 Fair value of plans assets at 31 March 2,709.1 2,681.9 2006 2005 Reconciliation of funded status of the plans to prepaid benefit cost m m Funded status of the plans 147.3 487.3 Unrecognised net actuarial loss 392.7 729.7 Unrecognised prior service cost 0.4 0.2 Prepaid benefit cost 245.8 242.2 Amounts recognised in balance sheet 2006 2005 UK arrangements m m Prepaid benefit cost 199.3 191.5 Accrued benefit liability 107.6 112.1 Accumulated other comprehensive loss 151.3 164.6 Total recognised 243.0 244.0 Amounts recognised in balance sheet 2006 2005 US arrangements Note m m Accrued benefit liability 5.0 202.8 Accumulated other comprehensive loss i 20.3 68.3 US regulatory assets i 148.5 Intangible assets 0.4 0.4 Exchange 12.9 16.2 Total recognised 2.8 1.8 i For the US pension arrangements the fair value of the plan assets were less than the accumulated benefit obligation.

j Commitments and contingencies Environmental issues The groups UK businesses are subject to numerous regulatory requirements with respect to the protection of the environment, including environmental laws which regulate the construction, operation and decommissioning of power stations, pursuant to legislation implementing environmental directives adopted by the EU and protocols agreed under the auspices of international bodies such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The group believes that it has taken and continues to take measures to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment.
Applicable regulations and requirements pertaining to the environment change frequently, however, with the result that continued compliance may require material investments, or that the groups costs and results of operation are less favourable than anticipated.
k Guarantees In accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
45 FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others: an Interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No.
34, the group is required to disclose certain guarantees as defined in FIN 45.
These guarantees principally relate to the groups disposal of its former operations and are typical of these types of transactions.
Furthermore, disclosure is required under FIN 45 of guarantees even where the likelihood that a liability will crystallise is remote.
FIN 45 also requires recognition of liabilities under US GAAP of the fair value of certain guarantees issued or modified after 31 December 2002.
No such guarantees have been identified.
The disclosures required to be made under FIN 45 are detailed below: At 31 March 2006, the group had entered into a number of transactions involving the sale of parts of its business and the purchase of certain businesses and assets in accordance with overall group strategy.
These transactions include the disposal of Southern Water, the demerger of Thus plc, the sale and disposal of the groups Appliance Retailing business, the sale of the Byley gas storage project, the sale of PacifiCorp and the disposal of other non-core activities.
It is standard practice in such transactions to obtain or grant contractual assurances, including in the form of warranties and indemnities.
In conducting merger, disposal or acquisition transactions the group takes significant steps to quantify and mitigate risk at the outset of any transaction and as the transaction progresses.
Steps include carrying out, or granting the facility for the conduct of, a thorough due diligence exercise to ascertain any likely liabilities and, where the group is the vendor, the use of caps and threshold levels for liability, inserting time limits on claim periods and detailed disclosure.
Under certain of the business disposals, indemnities under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 the Regulations are still outstanding.
These indemnities relate to potential liabilities with respect to former employees of the group in relation to their period of employment in the group.
Typically there is no maximum limit on claims under these indemnities.
152 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2005 06 44 Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued On 23 April 2002, the group sold Aspen 4 Limited, the owner of the Southern Water group of companies.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give assurances, in the form of warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
In relation to this transaction the warranty liability period commenced on 23 April 2002 and ends on 23 April 2007 for environmental warranties and on 23 April 2009 for tax warranties.
The warranty liability period for all other warranties expired on 23 April 2004.
The sale and purchase agreement contains a number of limitations to and exclusions of liability and maximum financial exposure for breach of the warranties apart from tax warranties is capped at 900.0 million.
For the tax warranties the maximum exposure is approximately 1,950.0 million.
There are also minimum threshold claim levels to be reached before a potential claim arises at all and thereafter as to whether it can be made.
The directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under these arrangements as a detailed due diligence exercise was carried out pre-disposal and detailed disclosures were made to the purchaser so as to make them aware of all relevant information concerning the business and, consequentially, to reduce the likelihood of claims being made against the group.
On 8 October 2001, certain business and assets of the groups former Appliance Retailing business were sold and the remainder of the business was closed.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give assurances in the form of certain warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
In relation to this transaction the warranty liability period commenced on 8 October 2001 and ended on 8 October 2003 with the exception of taxation and pensions warranties which end in October 2007.
The stated limit for all warranty claims was 75.0 million.
Under the transaction a number of properties were also assigned to the purchaser.
The purchaser became insolvent in August 2003.
By operation of law and through the putting in place of standard agreements at the time of the sale, the liability for rent and certain other items due under some of these lease arrangements have reverted to the group.
The maximum liability to the group for rental payments in the event of insolvency of the purchaser was estimated at approximately 9.0 million per annum.
Steps have been and are still being taken to mitigate the liability that arises from this, including surrendering leases to landlords and putting in place new tenants to take over the liability.
It is thus extremely unlikely that the group will ultimately become liable to this extent.
On 24 May 2005, ScottishPower as Seller Parent, ScottishPower Holdings Inc. as Seller and MidAmerican as Buyer entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which ScottishPower Holdings Inc. agreed to sell and MidAmerican agreed to buy all of the common stock of PacifiCorp.
ScottishPower, ScottishPower Holdings Inc. and MidAmerican entered into an amendment agreement to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated 21 March 2006 pursuant to which MidAmerican has agreed to release ScottishPower from indemnities and warranties other than those relating to corporate taxes and environmental issues in return for a $40 million reduction in certain payments due to be made by PacifiCorp to ScottishPower.
The liability under the tax indemnity is estimated at $170 million and provision has been made on this basis.
As a result of the sale of PacifiCorp the US tax group holds sufficient capital losses to offset this liability.
No provision has been made for the liability under environmental warranty.
The directors consider it unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under this arrangement as a detailed due diligence exercise was carried out pre-disposal and detailed disclosures were made to the purchaser so as to make them aware of all relevant information concerning the business and, consequently, to reduce the likelihood of claims being made against the group.
On 26 July 2005, ScottishPower Energy Management Limited entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with E. ON UK plc to dispose of the Byley gas storage project.
Consistent with normal practice, certain warranties and two specific tax covenants were given in the agreement.
The warranties will have ceased to have effect by 31 March 2007.
The two specific tax covenants are not time limited.
The directors consider it unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure due to the pre-disposal disclosures that were made.
ScottishPower Energy Retail Limited SPERL has entered into an agreement with Lloyds TSB in relation to energy marketing and services.
This agreement contains indemnities in relation to transfer of staff by operation of the Regulations from SPERL to Lloyds TSB.
The maximum liability is limited to 5.0 million.
No claims have been intimated.
Under certain cash collateral agreements, APX Gas Limited, APX Power Limited, Calyon and Elexon can draw down and use cash collateral in event of default situations including upon a change in credit rating.
The maximum financial exposure under these arrangements is 35.5 million.
Under the groups arrangements carried out in accordance with the standard terms and conditions of the International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. ISDA Master Agreement there are provisions that provide that the group will indemnify its counterparties against the payment if any of withholding tax and stamp duties and against losses incurred due to payments being made in currencies other than the currency chosen by the relevant counterparty.
A liability under this indemnification will only arise on the occurrence of certain changes to tax laws in the jurisdiction of a relevant counterparty.
The directors are not aware of any such contemplated changes.
Under the groups arrangements carried out in accordance with the International Emissions Trading Association IETA Emissions Trading Master Agreement there are provisions that provide that the group may have to indemnify its counterparties against the payment of certain emissions penalties if incurred in a situation where the group fails to make agreed trades and or if applied by the parties that the group will pay its counterparties any losses suffered due to the cancellation of trades in the situation where either party has cancelled trades due to a detrimental change in taxation law and or that the group will indemnify its counterparties against the payment if any of withholding taxes.
Under the groups arrangements carried out in accordance with the Grid Trade Master Agreement GTMA there is a provision that provides if utilised that the group will pay its counterparties any losses suffered due to the cancellation of trades in the situation where either party has cancelled trades due to a detrimental change in taxation law.
l Consolidation of Variable-Interest Entities VIEs FASB Interpretation No.
46 Consolidation of Variable-Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51 FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated VIEs to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved.
The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the groups results and financial position under US GAAP.
The group continues to evaluate the impact of FIN 46R as implementation guidance evolves.
If subsequent guidance or interpretation is different from managements current understanding, it is possible that the groups identification of VIEs and primary beneficiaries could change.
The continuing group has not identified any VIEs requiring to be consolidated.

EITF 05-6 requires leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination to be amortised over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition.
Additionally, the Issue requires improvements placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term to be amortised over the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased.
The adoption of EITF 05-6 has not had a material impact on the groups results of operations or financial position under US GAAP.
FAS 123R and related FASB Staff Positions FSPs In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment.
FAS 123R replaces FAS 123 and supersedes APB 25.
FAS 123R requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognised in the financial statements at fair value and that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.
FAS 123R is effective for the group from 1 April 2006.
From the effective date, compensation cost is recognised based on the requirements of FAS 123R for all new share based awards and based on the requirements of FAS 123 for all awards granted prior to the effective date of FAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date.
During 2005 the FASB issued FSP 123R-1, FSP 123R-2 and FSP 123R-3.
These FSPs detail various aspects of the implementation of FAS 123R.
ScottishPower is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of FAS 123R on the groups results of operations or financial position under US GAAP.
Other recent FASB pronouncements In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No.
FAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognised as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion 29, which amends APB Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions to eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with the general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.
FAS 153 is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005.
In March 2005, the FASB published FSP FIN 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
143 which clarifies the application of FAS 143 Accounting for Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets in respect of conditional asset retirement obligations.
The FSP is effective in the first period beginning after 15 December 2005.
In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.
FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 address the determination as to when an impairment in equity securities including cost method investments and debt securities that can contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the investor would not recover substantially all of its cost should be deemed other-than-temporary.
FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 nullifies certain requirements under EITF Issue No.
03-01 The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments that required the investor to make an evidence-based judgement as to whether it has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment in determining whether the impairment was other than temporary, and the measurement of the impairment loss.
The guidance in FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FIN 45-3 to provide clarification with respect to the application of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.
FSP FIN 45-3 includes within its scope and provides guidance concerning the application of FIN 45 to a guarantee granted to a business or to its owners that the entitys revenue or the revenue of a specified portion of the entity will meet a minimum amount referred to as a minimum revenue guarantee.
The group does not expect the adoption of the above pronouncements to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position under US GAAP.
In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
FAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No.
20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No.
3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
FAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle, and requires the retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable.
FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2005.
The adoption of FAS 154 will only have an effect when the group makes a change in accounting principle that is addressed by the standard.
