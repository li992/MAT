Accounting Policies The financial statements of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 1985.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the presentation of these financial statements are set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.

The adoption of each of these standards presents a change in accounting policy and the comparative gures have been restated accordingly, except where the exemption to restate comparatives has been taken.
Details of the effect of the prior year adjustments are given in note 12.
In accordance with the transitional rules for FRS 25 and FRS 26, the exemption regarding comparatives has been taken.
Accordingly there are no comparatives given against the current year, with separate disclosure provided for the prior year under the previously applicable FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
Other Income Net interest income is recognised on a time-apportioned basis.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Investment in Subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries includes the cost of share-based payments in respect of the ordinary shares of Woolworths Group plc that have been granted to employees of companies of which Woolworths Group plc is the ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment where considered necessary.
Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment Tangible xed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is provided where it is necessary to reect a reduction from book value to the estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Company.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is calculated by the straight-line method and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are between 10 per cent and 50 per cent.
Current Taxation The taxation charge for the current year is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using the rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred Taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the full provision method in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Pensions The Company is a member of the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme WGPS and the dened contribution scheme of Woolworths Group plc, the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust.
All employees are entitled to join the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme WGPS after completion of one years service.
The WGPS is a dened benefit pension scheme.
The Company also facilitates a Stakeholder pension arrangement for employees and makes contributions to a dened contribution pension scheme WGRT which was closed to new entrants in June 2003 and currently has 122 active members.
The exemption allowed under FRS 17 has been taken to account for the pension cost in respect of the dened benefit scheme in accordance with the contributions payable, as the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a reasonable and consistent basis.
Recognition of all the scheme assets and obligations under FRS 17 has been included in the financial statements of Woolworths plc, the company in the group that employs the majority of active members of the scheme.
Detailed disclosures in respect of the WGPS are also included in the financial statements of Woolworths plc.
Share-based Payments The Company no longer grants share options under its Executive Share Option Schemes.
Instead, Share Awards are made to senior management which vest dependent in part on performance targets being met.
A Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees, continues to operate.
The fair value of all share-based payments is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in the income statement reserve over the vesting period.
The proceeds received on the exercise of share options, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to the share capital and share premium accounts.
Costs incurred in respect of share-based payments to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised as a cost of investment in subsidiaries in the Company financial statements.
ESOP The Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust.
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
The purchase of shares for the trust is shown as a movement in retained earnings.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 70 Notes to the Company Accounts continued Financial Risk Management Disclosure of financial risk management factors and practices are included within the accounting policies outlined in the Group financial statements.
Derivative Financial Instruments From 1 February 2004 to 29 January 2005 Financial assets were recognised on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premia were charged or credited to the income statement over the life of the asset or liability to which they related.
Derivative financial instruments were accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they were held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
Where such instruments did not hedge an underlying asset or liability, they were accounted for using fair value accounting.
When a financial instrument ceased to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event was no longer likely to occur, the instrument was thereafter marked to its fair value in the financial statements.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments for hedging purposes was recognised on an accruals basis, and credited or charged to the income statement in the financial period in which it arose.
From 30 January 2005 onwards Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Company designates certain derivatives as a rm commitment fair value hedge.
The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivative instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting.
Such derivatives are classied at fair value through the income statement, and changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair Value Estimation The fair values of short-term deposits, loans, and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
The fair value of the Companys 100 million Bond 30 million being the hedged item has been calculated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current rates referenced from the zero coupon market curve.
The fair value of the Companys interest rate swap the hedging instrument is calculated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current rates referenced from the zero coupon market curve.
The fair value of credit vouchers in issue is the face value of the instruments that remain unredeemed and unextinguished at the balance sheet date.
