Group overview Operational review and Financial review and Financial statements CSR governance Group 99 21 Share based charges The Group currently has three types of share based payment scheme, namely Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Long Term Retention Plan LTRP and the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS.
Details of each of the schemes are given in the Directors Remuneration Report and in note 22.
The charge in the Group income statement for these schemes is US$9.7m 2005 : US$7.9m The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are given below: ESOS and LTRP There are currently 490 employees participating in these schemes.
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the options a BlackScholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of 20%-25%.
The share price volatility used of 35%-40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk free rate of return of 4%-5% is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
A dividend yield of 1.0% has been used in the calculation.
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year was 0.87 2005 : 0.45.
The fair value of options granted under the LTRP during the year ranged from 2.25 to 2.51 2005 : 1.37 to 1.72.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at 31 December 2006 is 6.0 years.
LTIS The actual performance for 2006 on the two non-market related performance targets has been assumed to continue for the remainder of the three year cycle and the share based charge is calculated using a fair value of 1.40.
The charge for the market related performance target has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using similar assumptions to the ESOS and LTRP calculations.
