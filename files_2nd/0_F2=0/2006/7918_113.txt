The Group operates retirement schemes which cover the majority of employees including Directors of the Group.
ICI policy, where practicable, is to provide retirement benefits for new employees on a defined contribution basis.
The Company pays pension contributions for each employee into an individual retirement account which is used to provide pension benefits at retirement.
This policy is now in place in the majority of countries in which ICI operates.
However, retirement plans for many existing employees are of the defined benefit type under which benefits are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration and are funded through separate  funds.
Full actuarial valuations of the Groups main defined benefit schemes are undertaken regularly, by independent qualified actuaries, normally at least triennially and adopting the projected unit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of the ICI Pension Fund and the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund, commissioned by the respective trustees of these funds, was obtained as at 31 March 2005.
In addition to this, full accounting valuations as at 31 December are obtained each year under both IFRS and US GAAP.
The largest pension plan in the Group is the ICI Pension Fund in the UK which accounts for approximately 82% of the Groups pension plan obligations and 81% of the Groups total post-retirement defined benefit obligations.
There are also other large, funded pension plans in the UK, USA, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium that account for approximately 15% of the Groups pension plan defined benefit obligations and other large, unfunded pension plans in the USA, Canada and Germany that account for approximately 2% of the Groups pension plan defined benefit obligations.
The remainder of the obligations comprise a large number of small plans, funded and unfunded, located throughout the world in the countries in which ICI operates.
The Group provides in North America, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, unfunded healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
At 31 December 2006 approximately 16,000 2005 17,000: 2004 18,000 current and retired employees were eligible to benefit from these schemes.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are fully accrued over the expected working lifetime of the existing members.
Key financial assumptions Group The principal weighted average rates used at 31 December were: 2006 2005 2004 % p. a.
Discount rate 5.1 4.8 5.3 Inflation rate 2.9 2.7 2.6 Long-term rate of increase in future earnings 4.4 4.2 4.0 Increase in pensions in payment 2.7 2.7 2.4 Post-retirement healthcare cost inflation rate 9.0 9.0 9.7 Expected rates of return on plan assets: Equities 8.3 8.2 8.2 Bonds 5.2 4.7 4.9 Other 8.3 5.7 4.6 Expected rate of return on reimbursement rights 5.6 4.6 The overall expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption is determined on a country-by-country and Euro-zone basis.
The rates are based on market expectations by asset classes, at the beginning of the period, for returns over the entire life of the related obligations.
The assumption setting process is based on short and long-term historical analysis and investment managers forecasts for equities, hedge funds and private equity, and the available market yields for bonds.
Mortality assumptions UK The Group analyses the mortality experience in the two main UK funds Funds both in terms of the current mortality table applied and the allowance for future improvements in longevity.
The mortality tables were PMA92C05MC with a 1.75 year age-rating for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C05MC with a 2.25 age-rating for female members retiring in normal health, with allowance for future mortality improvements in line with the medium cohort.
The table on the following page illustrates the effect of this change on the expected age at death of an average member retiring currently at age 62 and one who retires at age 62 in 10 years time.
The figures at 31 December 2004 are based on the demographic assumptions underlying the previous formal valuation of the ICI Pension Fund as at 31 March 2003 and were applied in the calculation of the pension liabilities at 31 December 2004.
The figures at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006 are those derived from the 31 March 2005 valuation.
Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill-health.
