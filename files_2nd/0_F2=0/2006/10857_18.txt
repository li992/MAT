NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The separate accounts of the parent Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The accounts have been prepared under the historic cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Leases Leases of tangible fixed assets where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Company, are classified as finance leases and are capitalised in the balance sheet as plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the fair value of the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases of assets where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of lease, or to the first review if shorter.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years The carrying value of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are held at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
Available for sale investments Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Where there is no active market for the Groups investments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flow analyses.
In the absence of any other reliable external information, assets are carried at amortised cost.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
Issue costs are amortised over the expected life of the instrument.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
98 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Pensions The Company participates in both the National Express Group multi-employer funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis, and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme under the requirements of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits.
Share-based payment In accordance with the transition provisions, FRS 20 Share-based payment has been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payment to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
Non-market-based performance-related vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value: instead those non-market conditions are taken into account in calculating the current best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and at each balance sheet date before vesting.
The cumulative expense is calculated based on that estimate.
Market-based performance conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value and at each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated irrespective of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are met.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit or loss account.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the profit and loss account.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, including the foreign currency contracts gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise Number of price Number of price share options p share options p Options without a nil exercise price: At 1 January 1,759,870 574 1,879,335 573 Granted during the year Lapsed during the year 24,304 985 75,352 583 Exercised during the year 1,242,443 511 44,113 520 1 Outstanding at 31 December 493,123 689 1,759,870 574 Exercisable at 31 December 38,679 782 295,632 790 Options with a nil exercise price: At 1 January 462,337 nil 9,352 nil Granted during the year 472,790 nil 455,009 nil Lapsed during the year 2,243 nil 2,024 nil Exercised during the year 2,093 nil Outstanding at 31 December 930,791 nil 462,337 nil Exercisable at 31 December Total outstanding at 31 December 1,423,914 2,222,207 Total exercisable at 31 December 38,679 295,632 1 Included within this balance are options over 35,487 2005: 629,339 shares for which no expense has been recognised in accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, as the options were granted before 7 November 2002 and have not been subsequently modified.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had exercise prices that were between 398p and 862.5p 2005: between 398p and 1224p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
Options were exercised throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 919p 2005: 875p.
105 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 17 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT CONTINUED The weighted average fair value of the remaining share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options with nil exercise price 2006 2005 Risk free interest rate Expected volatility 19.0% 25.0%27.0% Peer group volatility 29.7%31.2% 34.0% Expected option life in years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.4%3.5% 3.3%3.4% Weighted average share price 931p1033p 888p906p Weighted average exercise price 0p 0p Weighted average fair value of options granted 369p934p 561p821p Experience to date has shown that approximately 15% 2005: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to redundancies.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.
18 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating lease commitments The Company has entered into operating leases on certain properties.
Commitments for future minimum rental payments are shown below: Land and buildings 2006 2005 m m Operating leases which expire: Within two to five years 0.6 0.6 Contingent liabilities a Guarantees The Company has guaranteed credit facilities totalling 101.6m 2005: 99.8m of certain subsidiaries.

c Claims The Directors Report discloses that Ray OToole and Phil White have been joined as defendants in proceedings being brought before the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
These proceedings relate to a period of time when Ray OToole and Phil White were directors of Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd, which was a subsidiary of the Group.
The Company is also a defendant to these proceedings.
The Directors believe no liabilities will arise from these proceedings and therefore no provision has been made at 31 December 2006.
19 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 3c of FRS 8, Related party disclosures from disclosing transactions with related parties that are part of the National Express Group or investees of the Group.
