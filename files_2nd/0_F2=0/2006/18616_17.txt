128 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the company financial statements 1 Accounting policies i Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of certain investments, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
The Company has taken the exemption allowed under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The loss for the year was 3.5m 2005: profit of 1.5m.
On an historic cost basis, the loss for the year would have been 3.9m 2005: a profit of 1.5m.
These financial statements present information about the company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.
In accordance with the exemption in FRS 1, Cash Flow Statements, the company has not prepared a cash ow statement because one is included in its own consolidated financial statements.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8, Related Party Transactions, from the requirement to disclose such transactions on the grounds that it has presented its own consolidated financial statements.
ii Adoption of new standards The company financial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP, rather than under IFRS which has been adopted for group reporting.
UK GAAP is converging towards IFRS and a number of new Financial Reporting Standards became applicable for the first time in the year.
In these financial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the first time: FRS 20 Share-Based Payments FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
The corresponding amounts in these financial statements are, other than those covered by the exemption permitted by FRS 25 and FRS 26, restated in accordance with the new Standards.
FRS 25 and FRS 26 permit the corresponding amounts not to be restated and the company has adopted this approach.
The xed assets investment policy set out in note iv below provides further details of the effect of adopting FRS 26 on 1 October 2005.
FRS 21 requires that final dividends payable are recognised only in the period in which they are approved in the Annual General Meeting and therefore become a liability.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
This accounting treatment has superseded SSAP 17, Accounting for Post Balance Sheet Events which required dividends to be accrued for when proposed.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the companys financial statements.
129 1 Accounting policies continued iii Tangible xed assets These assets comprise ofce xtures, ttings and equipment and are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
iv Investments In 2005, investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
For 2006, investments in equity instruments that have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value can be reliably measured are fair valued under FRS 26. v Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts and their recognition in a tax computation.
In accordance with FRS 19 Deferred Tax, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
vi Own shares Transactions of The Grainger Trust Employee Trust Company Limited are included in the financial statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases of shares in Grainger Trust plc are debited directly to equity.

In the comparative period, all financial assets and liabilities were carried at cost, amortised as appropriate, less, in the case of financial assets, provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value cannot be reliably measured cannot be fair valued under FRS 26.
The investment in the Schroder Residential Property Unit Trust can be reliably measured and, therefore, has been fair valued under FRS 26.
