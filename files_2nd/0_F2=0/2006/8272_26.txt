The Group further breaks each geographical region into three distinct business models which offer different growth, return, risk and reward opportunities: Franchised Where Group companies neither own nor manage the hotel, but license the use of a Group brand and provide access to reservation systems, loyalty schemes and know-how.
The Group derives revenues from a brand royalty or licensing fee, based on a percentage of room revenue.
Managed Where, in addition to licensing the use of a Group brand, a Group company manages the hotel for third party owners.
The Group derives revenues from base and incentive management fees and provides the system infrastructure necessary for the hotel to operate.
Management contract fees are generally a percentage of hotel revenue and may have an additional incentive fee linked to profitability or cash flow.
The terms of these agreements vary, but are often long-term for example, 10 years or more.
The Groups responsibilities under the management agreement typically include hiring, training and supervising the managers and employees that operate the hotels under the relevant brand standards.
In order to gain access to central reservation systems, global and regional brand marketing and brand standards and procedures, owners are typically required to make a further contribution.
Owned and leased Where a Group company both owns or leases and operates the hotel and, in the case of ownership, takes all the benefits and risks associated with ownership.
Segmental results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Soft Drinks This business, which manufactures a variety of soft drink brands with distribution concentrated mainly in the UK, was sold in December 2005.

The Audit Committee has a process to ensure that any non-audit services do not compromise the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and that relevant UK and US professional and regulatory requirements are met.
A number of criteria are applied when deciding whether pre-approval for such services should be given.
These include the nature of the service, the level of fees and the practicality of appointing an alternative provider, having regard to the skills and experience required to supply the service effectively.
Cumulative fees for audit and non-audit services are presented to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis for review.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring adherence to the pre-approval policy.

9 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year available for IHG equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, excluding investment in own shares, in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by adjusting basic earnings per ordinary share to reflect the notional exercise of the weighted average number of dilutive ordinary share options outstanding during the year.
On 1 June 2006, shareholders approved a share capital consolidation on the basis of seven new ordinary shares for every eight existing ordinary shares, together with a special dividend of 118p per existing ordinary share.
The overall effect of the transaction was that of a share repurchase at fair value, therefore no adjustment has been made to comparative data.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share is disclosed in order to show performance undistorted by special items, to give a more meaningful comparison of the Groups performance.

Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing as follows: 2006 2005 m m The Americas managed operations 72 82 Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations 37 36 109 118 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that an impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Growth rates are based on management expectations and industry growth forecasts.
The growth rates used to determine cash flows beyond five years do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
66 IHG Annual report and financial statements 2006 Notes to the Group financial statements 12 Goodwill continued The Americas managed operations The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on an estimated growth rate of 4% 2005 4%.
After this period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on a perpetual growth rate of approximately 3% 2005 3%.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flow is 10.5% 2005 10.5%.
Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on an estimated growth rate of 15% 2005 15%.
After this period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on a perpetual growth rate of approximately 4% 2005 4%.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11.0% 2005 11.0%.
With regard to the assessment of value in use, management believe that the carrying values of the CGUs would only exceed their recoverable amounts in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.

The fair value of unlisted equity shares has been estimated using valuation guidelines issued by the British Venture Capital Association and is based on assumptions regarding expected future earnings.
Listed equity share valuation is based on observable market prices.
Other financial assets consist mainly of trade deposits made in the normal course of business.
The deposits have been designated as loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.

The Group also maintains a US-based InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan and post-employment benefits scheme.
This plan is now closed to new members and pensionable service no longer accrues for current employee members.
In addition, the Group operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, those schemes.

Revenue losses include 1m 2005 nil in respect of losses which arose during a period of hotel refurbishment and which are expected to be utilised against future operating profit.
Tax losses with a value of 192m 2005 282m, including capital losses with a value of 87m 2005 93m, have not been recognised as their use is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely with the exception of 1m 2005 nil which expires after seven years and 1m 2005 nil which expires after 15 years.
Deferred tax assets of 6m 2005 19m in respect of share-based payments, 7m 2005 7m in respect of employee benefits and 17m 2005 11m in respect of other items have not been recognised as the timing of their realisation and consequent use is uncertain or not currently anticipated and, in part, is dependent upon the outcome of EU case law.
Other items include 7m 2005 nil which expire after nine years.
At 31 December 2006, the Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.
Quantifying the temporary differences is not practical.
However, based on current enacted law and on the basis that the Group is in a position to control the timing and realisation of these temporary differences, no material tax consequences are expected to arise.
27 Authorised and issued share capital Authorised ordinary shares and redeemable preference share 3 At 31 December 2006, the authorised share capital was 160,050,000, comprising 1,400,000,000 ordinary shares of 11 7p each and one redeemable preference share of 50,000.

Under the arrangement, shareholders received 11 new ordinary shares and 24.75 cash in exchange for every 15 existing ordinary shares held on 24 June 2005.
The entire issued share capital of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC was transferred to New InterContinental Hotels Group PLC at fair market value, in exchange for the issue of 443 million fully paid ordinary shares of 10p each, which were admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange on that date.
In accordance with the merger relief provisions of Sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985, the 443 million shares are recorded only at nominal value.
c On 1 June 2006, shareholders approved a share capital consolidation on the basis of seven new ordinary shares for every eight existing ordinary shares.
This 3 provided for all the authorised ordinary shares of 10p each whether issued or unissued to be consolidated into new ordinary shares of 11 7p each.
The share capital consolidation became effective on 12 June 2006. d Whilst the authorised share capital comprises one redeemable preference share of 50,000, following its redemption in September 2005, this redeemable preference share has not been re-issued.
The authority given to the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 1 June 2006 to purchase its own shares was still valid at 31 December 2006.
A resolution to renew the authority will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 1 June 2007.
