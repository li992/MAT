During the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2006, the Group has determined that there is no impairment of any of its cash generating units CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The recoverable amounts have been determined on the basis of value in use calculations.
In order to test goodwill for impairment the Group prepares cash flow forecasts for each CGU derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows based on conservative estimated growth rates within the divisions of 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the construction industry or GDP.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8%.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, the amounts due from construction contract customers, trade receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to the amounts due from construction contract customers and trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by the directors based on prior experience and their assessment of specific circumstances.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Interest rate swaps Certain of the Groups joint ventures use interest rate swaps to manage their exposure to floating interest rate movement on bank borrowings.
The Groups share of contracts with nominal values of 29.4m have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 4.98% for periods up until 2033.
The fair value of swaps entered into at 31 December 2006 is estimated at 0.8m 2005: 2.2m.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been taken to the hedging reserve note 23.
Loan notes Loan notes were issued in 2002 as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Pipeline Constructors Group plc.
The final 120,000 outstanding at 31 December 2005 were redeemed on 2 January 2006.

The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the Trustees of the Plan.
The total cost charged to income of 4.8m 2005: 4.7m represents contributions payable to the defined contribution section of the Plan by the Group at rates specified in the Plan rules.
As at 31 December 2006, contributions of 0.4m 2005: 0.4m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the Plan.
Defined benefits scheme The Plan includes some defined benefit liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued benefit rights of former active and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group.
These include final salary related benefits for members in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995.
No further defined benefit membership rights can accrue after that date.
Under the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits at a retirement age of 65.
No other retirement benefits are provided.
The Plan is currently being funded.
The last triennial valuation of the Plan was undertaken on 5 April 2004 and was prepared using assumptions of a rate of investment return of 6.0% per annum, a rate of earnings escalation of 4.0% per annum and rate of inflation of 2.5% per annum.
The ongoing liabilities of the Plan were assessed using the projected unit method whereas the assets were taken at realisable market value.
The actuarial valuation referred to showed that the defined benefit liabilities were partly funded and, on an ongoing basis, the value of the assets of 3.9m represented 64% of the value of these liabilities.
The actuarial valuation also showed that the realisable market value of the Plans assets was 81% of its minimum liabilities when assessed on the Minimum Funding Requirement basis as defined in the Pensions Act 1995.
The next triennial valuation will be carried out as at 5 April 2007 when the funding position will be re-appraised.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liabilities was as at 31 December 2006.
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit method.
