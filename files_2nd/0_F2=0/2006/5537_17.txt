Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of properties and have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
No Profit and Loss Account is presented for Enterprise Inns plc as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of FRS 1 revised which exempts companies which are part of a group which has published a consolidated cash flow statement from preparing a cash flow statement.
Accordingly, no cash flow statement for the Company has been presented.
These accounts are for the Company and are not consolidated financial statements.
Separate consolidated financial statements for the Group are prepared under IFRS and are published separately within this document.
Change in accounting policies The Company adopted the following new accounting standards on 1 October 2005 which require changes in accounting policy: Share-based payments FRS 20 The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The cost is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Profit and Loss Account.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
The fair value of share options is measured using valuation models.
On adoption of this standard a deferred tax asset was recognised.
Post-balance sheet events FRS 21 Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are no longer reported as liabilities.
Proposed dividends are no longer shown in the Profit and Loss Account or accrued for in the balance sheet.
Financial Instruments FRS 26 The Company's existing interest rate swap is now recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
The swap is remeasured at every balance sheet date.
Any change in the value of the swap is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account unless hedge accounting is adopted.
Hedge accounting has not been adopted for the year ended 30 September 2006.
Prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect this accounting treatment.
The Company has not adopted any of the transitional provisions of FRS 26.

The Company also adopted the following new accounting standards but these standards have no impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
Only those new standards that are relevant to the Company have been listed below: n FRS 22 Earnings per Share n FRS 25 Financial Instruments: disclosure and presentation replaced by FRS 29 n FRS 28 Corresponding amounts n FRS 29 Financial instruments: Disclosure the exemption has been taken per FRS 29.2D b.
The Company is exempt from producing the disclosures required by the standard as the Group accounts contain disclosure that complies with FRS 29.

Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies Tangible fixed assets Expenditure on additions and improvements to tangible fixed assets is capitalised as the expenditure is incurred.
Substantially all of the Group's licensed estate is valued each year on an existing use basis.
Surpluses arising from the professional valuation of the estate are recognised in the Revaluation Reserve.
Valuation surpluses realised on sale are transferred to the Profit and Loss Account reserve.
Any deficit arising from the valuation of properties is recognised in the Revaluation Reserve until the carrying amount reaches historical cost and, thereafter, to the extent that the value in use can be demonstrated to be higher than valuation.
Any other deficit is charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
It is the Company's policy to maintain properties comprising the licensed estate in such condition that the residual values of the properties are at least equal to their book values.
Having regard to this, it is the opinion of the directors that depreciation of any such property as required by the Companies Act 1985 and generally accepted accounting practice would not be material.
An annual impairment review is carried out on such properties.
Short leasehold properties, defined as properties with 50 years or less of the lease remaining unexpired, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of tangible fixed assets over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
Leases and hire purchase commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost incurred and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Deferred tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that results in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions: n Provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets on where, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding commitment to dispose of the replacement assets with no likely subsequent rollover or available capital losses.
n Provision is made for deferred tax on gains on revalued fixed assets only where there is a commitment to dispose of the revalued assets and the attributable gain can neither be rolled over or eliminated by capital losses.
n Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2006 97 12997ENTERPRI 11 12 06 4:23 pm Page 98 Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2006 1.
Accounting policies continued Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury are deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.
Revenue recognition Beer and cider sales and wines, spirits and minerals sales are recognised when these goods are delivered to our customers.
Rents receivable from the licensed estate and machine income are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Capital instruments Finance costs in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Use of accounting estimates and judgements The Company makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: a Property, Plant and Equipment Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The valuation is based on market observations and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing.
Non-current assets held for sale are valued at their market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub.
The Company estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
b Valuation of interest rate swaps The Company measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The swap valuation rates are derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry rate.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.

The land and buildings were valued at market value as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book, reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield.
The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies under which the properties are let.
Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and tenure.
The valuations are made by reference to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by Humberts Leisure Limited.
The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc has been valued by the Head of Estates.
The results of this valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers confirming that the results are entirely consistent.
Pubs identified for disposal are held at their realisable value.
This value is based on the estimated realisable disposal proceeds ERV which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.

Share Incentive Plan The SIP is open to all employees.
At times determined by the Company, employees may allocate the lower of 1,500 and 10% of pre-tax salary to purchase shares out of their salary.
The Board may also decide to award matching shares.
The shares are held in trust on behalf of the employee.
If shares are removed from trust within three years, any allocation of matching shares may be lost.
Shares can be transferred tax-free to employees after a period of five years.
This scheme is operating for the first time in 2005 06 and matching shares were awarded.
The cost of the matching shares is being spread over the three year vesting period of the scheme.
Employee Share Option Scheme The ESOS scheme is open to all employees.
Share options are awarded to employees at the discretion of the Board.
The current intention of the Board is to issue options with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share at grant date.
Options will normally vest after 3 years if an employee remains in service and if EPS growth targets are met.
For options granted during the year ended 30 September 2006 options will only vest in full if the average compound annual percentage growth in adjusted EPS between the grant date and the third anniversary of the grant date is 8.33%.
Options may normally only be exercised during the period of 7 years commencing on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the option.
Options will usually be settled by issuing ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.

Share-based payments continued Savings-Related Share Option Scheme The SAYE scheme is open to executive directors and employees at the discretion of the Board.
Participants contract to save a fixed amount each month with a savings institution for a period of five or seven years.
At the end of the savings term, participants are given the option to purchase shares at a price set before the savings began.
The option price will be not less than 80% of the market value of a share on the date that participants are invited to take part in the scheme, or the nominal value of a share if lower.
Options will usually be settled using ordinary shares held by Enterprise Inns Quest Trustees Ltd an employee benefit trust and will usually be exercisable for six months after the fifth or seventh anniversary of the commencement of the savings contract.

Share-based payments continued Fair value of share schemes The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using share option valuation models.
The ESOS, SAYE and STIP schemes are valued using the Black-Scholes model.
The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black-Scholes model.
The element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
The following tables list the inputs to the models for options granted during the year: ESOS SAYE Weighted average: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Share price 9 7.18 9 6.81 Exercise price 9 7.18 7 5.45 Dividend yield 2.4% 2.2% 2.4% 2.2% Expected volatility 21% 23% 21% 22% Risk-free interest rate 4.2% 4.3% 4.2% 4.46% Expected life of option years 3.3 3.3 5 or 7 5 or 7 STIP LTIP Weighted average: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Share price 10.55 8.81 8.81 6.84 Exercise price Dividend yield 2.4% 2.2% 2.4% 2.2% Expected volatility 22% 22% 21% 22% Risk-free interest rate 4.3% 4.48% 4.2% 4.42% Expected life of option years 4 4 3-5 3-5 Expected share price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of the option.
The expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met.
This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.
These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte-Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR element of the scheme.
The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after 3, 4 and 5 years.
Related parties The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 not to disclose transactions with other Group companies.
