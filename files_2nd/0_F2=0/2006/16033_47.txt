Excluding 999 year leases, the average loan term for these properties is 50 years and the average borrowing rate has been determined at the inception of the lease to be 8.9%.
In addition the Group leases certain fixtures and equipment under finance leases, the obligations for which are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
The average lease term is 3-4 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the average implicit borrowing rate was 14.6% 2005: 14.2%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All lease obligations, which are denominated in Sterling, are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
e Loan notes Included in borrowings due within the year are 7.9 million 2005: 8.2 million in respect of loan notes issued as consideration for the acquisition of two groups during 1999 and 2000.
The loan notes of 4.3 million issued in 1999 to acquire Sharpe and Fisher can be redeemed on 31 January and 31 July each year, the final redemption date being 31 January 2010.
The 3.6 million of loan notes issued for the acquisition of the business of Broombys Limited are redeemable on 30 June and 31 December each year until the final redemption date of 30 June 2015. f Interest The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2006 2005 % % Unsecured senior notes 5.8 Bank loans and overdrafts 5.7 5.5 Other borrowings 5.0 4.9 Bank term loans and revolving credit facilities of 970 million 2005: 1.2 billion were arranged at variable interest rates.
The $400 million unsecured senior notes were issued at fixed rates of interest and swapped into variable rates.
This exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
As detailed in note 25, to manage the risk the Group entered into amortising interest rate swap arrangements, which for 2006, fix interest rates on 315 million of borrowing.
For the year to 31 December 2006 this had the effect of increasing the weighted average interest rates paid by 0.01%.
In respect of income earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.

There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed.
Details about the fair values of derivatives are given in note 25. h Guarantees and security No debt is secured, except for that relating to 1.9 million 2005: 3.6 million of finance lease obligations, which are secured on the assets subject to the leases.
There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts between group companies.
The companies listed in note 18, with the exception of Benchmarx Kitchens and Joinery Limited, together with Wickes Limited are guarantors of the following facilities advanced to Travis Perkins plc: 270 million term loan: 700 million revolving credit facility: $400 million unsecured senior notes note 24i : The interest rate and currency swaps note 25.
The Group companies have entered into other guarantee and counter-indemnities arrangements in respect of guarantees issued in favour of group companies by the clearing banks amounting to approximately 14 million 2005: 14 million.
i Unsecured senior notes On 26 January 2006 the Group finalised a US private placement that resulted in it receiving $400 million and repaying 230 million of the term loan.
$200 million of the unsecured senior notes is repayable in January 2013 and $200 million in January 2016.
The US borrowings carry fixed rate coupons of between 130 bps and 140 bps over US treasuries.
