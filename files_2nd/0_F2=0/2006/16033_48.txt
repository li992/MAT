DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowing is either on a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the Group uses interest rate swaps and interest rate collars.
As part of their interest rate management processes, the Group and the Company are parties to two amortising interest rate swaps, one amortising interest rate floor option and an amortising interest rate cap option.
The two interest rate swaps each have a notional value of 157.5 million.
The interest rate cap and floor options provide a collar on 157.5 million of borrowings.
Contracts with nominal values of 315 million have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 4.95% for periods up until February 2010 and have floating interest receipts at 0% plus LIBOR.
At 31 December 2006 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate approximately 3 years from the balance sheet date, to which the Group and the Company were parties was estimated at 4.3 million 2005: 5.1 million.
This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 1.1 million 2005: 0.5 million in respect of the fair value movement on the cap and floor has been taken to the income statement as the Company has not applied hedge accounting.
Currency swaps In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $400 million unsecured senior notes described in note 24 i the Group and the Company have entered into five cross currency swaps in varying amounts between 23 million and 63 million to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire lives of the unsecured senior notes, although there is a mutual break clause on each swap on 1 December 2010.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the unsecured senior notes to 231 million as well as fixing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
The currency swaps manage the Groups and the Companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 26 January 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps of 58 million that convert the borrowing rate on $200 million of debt from 5.77% to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a weighted average basis point increment of 81.9.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were both at 5.43%.
A further three interest rate swaps of 29 million, 23 million and 63 million convert the borrowing rates on $50 million, $40 million and $110 million of debt from 5.89% to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increment of 86.5, 86.7 and 86.05 respectively.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were at 5.47 weighted average per cent.
At 31 December the fair value of currency derivatives, all of which terminate more than five years after the balance sheet date, was estimated at 30.9 million 2005: 1.3 million.
All of these currency swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges.
In addition the Group is party to US$ forward foreign exchange contracts.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was $12 million 2005: US$ nil.
The fair value of these derivatives are 0.2 million 2005: nil.
These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
