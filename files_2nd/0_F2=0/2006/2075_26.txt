These investments are held for the benefit of the BHP Billiton Group but are not available for the general purposes of the BHP Billiton Group.
c Investments held by the Ingwe, Selbaie and Rio Algom Environmental Trust Funds and the Samancor Rehabilitation Trust.
The future realisation of these investments is intended to fund environmental obligations relating to the closure of Ingwes, Selbaies, Rio Algoms and Samancors mines and consequently these investments, whilst under the BHP Billiton Group control, are not available for the general purposes of the BHP Billiton Group.
All income from these investments is reinvested or spent to meet these obligations.
The BHP Billiton Group retains responsibility for these environmental obligations until such time as the former mine sites have been rehabilitated in accordance with the relevant environmental legislation.
These obligations are therefore included under non-current provisions.
