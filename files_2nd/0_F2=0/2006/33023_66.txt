24 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where the company contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over 1, 3 or 5 years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The UK plan, which is the single largest plan, has specific restrictions imposed on one section of the membership preventing amendments that will prejudice the rights or interest of that section of the membership.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate fiduciary administered funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by the Company and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to the Companys credit rating, market capitalisation and cash flows.
