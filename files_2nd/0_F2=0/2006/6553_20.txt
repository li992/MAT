6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is 54.8 pence 2005: 64.3 pence.
The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 218.0 million 2005: 252.8 million divided by the average number of shares in issue during the year of 397.7 million 2005: 393.1 million.
Diluted earnings per share is 54.6 pence 2005: 64.0 pence.
The calculation is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average number of shares in issue plus the dilutive potential ordinary shares amounting to 1.8 million 2005: 1.8 million shares.
The dilutive potential ordinary shares relate to shares provisionally allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between earnings per share before exceptional items and basic earnings per share.
Earnings per share before exceptional items, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.

Some of the instruments used by the Group, whilst appropriately managing the economic exposure of the Group, do not meet the conditions required to be classified as hedge instruments.
As a result gains and or losses on interest rate swaps are taken to finance costs in the Income Statement which creates a degree of volatility in finance costs.

The assets of the schemes are held in separate Trustee administered funds.
The largest, which is in the UK, is the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme, and is of the funded, defined benefit type.
It is closed to new entrants.
The Trustees are George Wimpey Pension Trustees Limited and the Law Debenture Trust Corporation Plc.
The Scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent actuaries, the last such valuation being carried out as at 31 March 2005, using the projected unit method.
Details of this valuation are given below.
For new employees in the UK, George Wimpey pays contributions into stakeholder pension arrangements.
The actuarial assumptions which have the most significant effect are those relating to return on investment, the rate of increase in salaries and the assumed rate of pension increases.
In the 31 March 2005 valuation it was assumed that the investment return prior to retirement would exceed long dated gilt yields by 2.25% per annum and post retirement by 0.25% per annum.
Salary increases were assumed to exceed price ination by 2.0% per annum.
Pension increases were assumed to be in line with ination.
The market value of assets was 591 million and the present value of liabilities accrued to members after allowing for the expected future increase in earnings was 739 million.
This equated to a gross deficit of 148 million and 104 million net of deferred tax.
The Company has agreed to continue contributions equivalent to 15 million per annum to fund the deficit.
This is in addition to the ongoing costs of providing future service benefits.
The Group has paid contributions of 20.5 million 2005: 21.1 million to the Scheme during the year.
Two material benefit changes occurred during 2006.
Firstly, pension increases for pension earned in respect of service post 5 April 2006 was limited to the lower of the increase in the Retail Prices Index or 2.5% each year.
Secondly, members were permitted to increase the amount of tax free cash exchanged for pension in line withtax simplicationchanges introduced by the Government on 6 April 2006.
Contributions were paid at a rate of 13.2% of Scheme salary up to 31 March 2006 and 15.7% thereafter plus 15 million 2005:13.5% plus 15 million during 2006.
A qualified, independent actuary updated the 31 March 2005 valuation to 31 December 2006, as required by IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made at 31 December 2006 were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Discount rate 5.0% 4.9% 5.4% Rate of increase in salaries 4.3% 4.6% 4.6% Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.8% 2.6% 2.6% Rate of increase of pensions in payment pre April 2006 pension 2.8% 2.6% 2.6% post April 2006 pension 2.0% n a n a Ination 2.8% 2.6% 2.6% At the time of the 31 March 2005 actuarial valuation of the Scheme, a study was undertaken into the recent Scheme mortality experience.
The tables adopted reect the results of this study and represent current expectations of mortality experience within the Scheme.
In particular an appropriate allowance has been made within the assumptions for future mortality improvements.
