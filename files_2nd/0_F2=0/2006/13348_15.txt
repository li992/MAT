The Restaurant Group plc 41 Annual Report 2006 Note 2 Additional income statement Additional income statement information is provided as a useful guide to underlying trading performance.
The adjustments from the statutory income statement are to aid understanding of the income statement and should be read in conjunction with, rather than as a substitute for, the reported information.
DPP Restaurants Ltd DPP was consolidated as a subsidiary under IAS 27 throughout 2005 even though The Restaurant Group plc TRG or The Group legally only held 19.9% of the issued share capital due to the existence of an option to take full control of DPP which became exercisable on 31 December 2004.
The additional income statement segregates the results of DPP in 2005 when the business was not under the direct control of the Board.
TRG acquired full control of DPP on 12 January 2006 for a nominal sum and therefore the Group results include those of DPP in 2006.
The 2006 and 2005 results include a number of items which are of a one-off nature and not representative of the underlying trading performance of the business.
These have been separately identified in the additional income statement as non-trading items.
For the purposes of the additional income statement, a normalised tax rate of 34% has been applied to the trading business to reflect the underlying effective tax rate.

Further details are provided in the Directors remuneration report on page 29.
During the year Mr Alan M. Jackson exercised 400,000 share options at an exercise price of 45p, and as at 31 December 2006 there are 400,000 share options outstanding.
No charge to the income statement is recognised in respect of Mr Alan M. Jacksons share options as they were granted prior to 7 November 2002.
Note 2 : To ensure comparability of the value of options to option holders, the exercise price and number of shares awarded were subject to amendment following the Placing on 14 January 2004.
Executive Share Option Plans ESOPs The Group has in place two ESOPs, the 1998 scheme and 2003 scheme.
Under these schemes the Remuneration Committee may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to employees of the Group.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Awards under the ESOPs are generally reserved for senior management level and above and 33 employees were eligible to participate at 31 December 2006.
Options granted under the ESOPs become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to growth in earnings 1 per share exceeding RPI growth by more than 4% under the 1998 scheme or 2 2% under the 2003 scheme.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
Options were valued using a Stochastic option pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
As permitted by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005 have been valued.
A reconciliation of the movement in outstanding share options under the ESOPs is provided below: At 31 December 2006 At 1 January 2006 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise Number price p Number price p Outstanding at the start of the year 5,705,264 94.8p 5,304,658 77.5p Granted 1,629,000 134.4p Exercised 1,367,199 67.0p 715,863 59.1p Lapsed 167,549 110.1p 512,531 91.1p Outstanding at the end of the year 4,170,516 103.3p 5,705,264 94.8p Exercisable at the end of the year 1,029,543 67.7p 169,439 65.8p During 2006, the weighted average market price at date of exercise was 227p per share 2005: 137p.
During 2003 the Group adopted the 2003 Executive Share Option Mirror Scheme.
The 2003 Mirror Scheme was introduced on similar terms to the 1998 Scheme save for certain changes which are incorporated into the 2003 Mirror Scheme.
The 2003 Mirror Scheme was designed so that an option granted pursuant to the 2003 Mirror Scheme Mirror Options could be issued to both existing holders of options under the 1998 Scheme 1998 Options and to new participants.
However holders of share options granted under the 1998 Scheme can only exercise either their mirror options or their 1998 options, but not both.
Mirror Options can only be exercised by 1998 Option holders if their 1998 Options have not already been exercised.
If their 1998 Options are exercised or lapse then the Mirror Options will lapse.
The Mirror Options held by 1998 Option holders have a life for the residue of the life of the existing 1998 Options.
The Restaurant Group plc Notes to the accounts continued 52 Annual Report 2006 20 Share-based payment schemes continued Long-Term Incentive Plan On 9 November 2005 an Extraordinary General Meeting of The Restaurant Group plc approved the adoption of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the Group.
Details of the LTIP are provided in the Directors remuneration report on pages 24 to 29.
Options were granted to Directors and selected employees on 7 December 2005 1,131,188 Conditional Award share options and 643,515 Matching Award share options were granted.
In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is required to acquire a number of shares by 7 May 2006, known as Deposited Shares, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for those Matching Award share options to be valid.
During the period to 31 December 2006, a total of 308,652 options have lapsed and a total of 1,466,051 options were outstanding at 31 December 2006 and are not exercisable until 2009.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust.
The fair value of a share at the time of grant was 1.47.
Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment.
None of the options under the LTIP scheme were exercisable at the year end.
Following the year end, a further award was made to Directors and selected employees.
On 8 March 2007, 567,263 Conditional Award share options and 247,908 Matching Award share options were granted at a value of 3.255 per option.
The conditions pertaining to the 2007 award mirror those of the award made on 7 November 2005.
Save As You Earn scheme Under the Save As You Earn SAYE scheme the Board may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to UK-based employees of the Group.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a fixed amount from salary into a savings account each month, for a three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.
As permitted by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002, which were unvested at 1 January 2005, have been valued.
None of the share options under the SAYE scheme were exercisable at 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2006.

No separate cash flow has been presented in respect of discontinued activities as it is not possible to separately identify working capital or financing payments and receipts in respect of these operations, as these are centrally managed.
EBITDA and capital additions approximately represent operating and investing cash flows.
Major non-cash transactions As disclosed in notes 5 and 13, during the year the Group performed an impairment review on the carrying value of Living Ventures.
In light of the recent trading performance, the Board has concluded that it is appropriate to make a provision of 9.5m against the carrying value of the loan note payable in 2008.
The impairment represents a significant non-cash transaction.

a Interest rate risk and liquidity profile Financial assets The financial assets of the Group comprised: 2006 2005 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents Sterling 510 368 Cash and cash equivalents Euro 173 58 683 426 Trade and other receivables 5,170 5,498 Current financial assets 5,853 5,924 Non-current financial assets 875 10,375 Total financial assets 6,728 16,299 Cash and cash equivalents include balances held on which interest is received at floating rates in the overnight money market.
The loan note is secured on the assets of Est Est Est Restaurants Limited but is subject to a prior ranking behind Living Ventures Limiteds bank.
Other details regarding interest and maturity are provided in note 13.
The Restaurant Group plc 55 Annual Report 2006 24 Financial instruments and derivatives continued Financial liabilities The financial liabilities of the Group comprised: 2006 2005 000 000 Short-term borrowings at floating interest rates 1,165 1,845 Trade and other payables 74,864 71,476 Short-term financial liabilities 76,029 73,321 Long-term borrowings at floating interest rates 47,000 11,000 Finance lease debt 2,737 2,696 Provisions 3,466 763 Long-term financial liabilities 53,203 14,459 Financial liabilities 129,232 87,780 Total financial liabilities attracting interest were 48,165,000 2005: 12,845,000.
Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR or base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 6.30% 2005: 5.50%.
Effective from 16 January 2003, the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20,000,000 to be fixed at 4.55% per annum for a period of three years, terminating on 15 January 2006.
The Group also entered into an interest rate swap for a further notional amount of 20,000,000 to be fixed at 4.395% per annum for a period of three years, effective from 16 January 2003 which terminated on 15 January 2006.
This second interest rate swap provided the counterparty with the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a further transaction to renew the interest rate swap on 20,000,000 at 4.395% for a further two years, terminating on 15 January 2008.
This option was not taken up by the counterparty.
Effective from 16 January 2006, the Group entered into a new interest rate swap for an initial notional amount of 20,000,000, rising to 50,000,000 from 18 April 2006 until 16 January 2008, when it reduces to 30,000,000 until 16 January 2009, when it terminates.
The fixed rate for the duration of the three years is 4.695%.
The Group has 33,000,000 2005: 69,000,000 of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings at 31 December 2006 which are due to expire in 2008, when the bank loan of 47,000,000 2005: 11,000,000 is also due to expire.
b Foreign currency exposure profile as at 31 December 2006 The Group has invested in and operates three restaurants in Spain, where the currency is the Euro.
Consequently the Group has a potential currency exposure on the translation of results from its Spanish operations, and translating the assets and liabilities from Euros to the Groups reporting currency, Sterling.
This exposure is reviewed on a regular basis, and is not considered to be material to the performance of the Group, or to the balance sheet.
c Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Book value Fair value Book value Fair value Primary financial instruments held or used 2006 2006 2005 2005 to finance the Groups operations: 000 000 000 000 Cash and deposits 683 683 426 426 Overdraft loan maturing within one year 1,165 1,165 1,845 1,845 Borrowings maturing after one year 47,000 47,000 11,000 11,000 47,482 47,482 12,419 12,419 The Group does not hold any financial instruments for trading purposes.
The fair value of short term borrowings and cash in hand together with short-term non-interest bearing trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate to book values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
As highlighted in note 13, book value approximates to fair value in respect of the non-current receivable of 875,000.
The Group has derivative instruments relating to interest rate swaps.
In accordance with IAS 39 this has been valued at 31 December 2006.
The fair value of this instrument was 652,000 2005: 7,000 and this is accounted for in the consolidated balance sheet.
Movements on the fair value are recorded through the consolidated income statement.
In accordance with the transitional provisions available under IFRS 1, the Group did not adopt IAS 39 until periods commencing after 1 January 2005.
Consequently, opening reserves were adjusted by the fair value of the interest rate swap on 1 January 2005 and net assets of the Group increased by 127,000, with an equivalent increase in equity.
d Credit risk The Group has credit risks on its trade debtors and the long-term receivable from Living Ventures Limited.
In light of the current trading performance of Living Ventures Limited, and following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business, including the loan note receivable, the Board has concluded it is appropriate to make a 9.5m provision against the long-term receivable.
Due to the nature of the Groups business there are not significant exposures on underlying revenue trading.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with financial institutions with strong credit ratings.

Within these concession arrangements there is usually a concession fee for each unit which is based on the revenue derived from that unit.
26 Capital commitments 2006 2005 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 15,948 14,206 27 Related party transactions Living Ventures Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Groups 40% holding.
During the year interest of 634,000 was accrued on the loan note between Living Ventures Limited and The Restaurant Group plc at the rate of LIBOR.
The Group recognised nil 2005: 522,000 in respect of interest income due from Living Ventures Limited.
Under the terms of the loan note none of this interest was payable as at 31 December 2006, consequently in addition to the loan note of 10,375,000 outstanding at that date, 1,156,000 of interest receivable was also due from Living Ventures Limited.
Following a detailed review of the carrying value of Living Ventures, and in light of current trading performance, the Board has concluded that it is appropriate to make a provision of 9.5m against the loan note repayable in 2008.
For the year to 31 December 2006, Alan M. Jackson received a fee of 35,000 2005: 35,000 from Living Ventures Limited in respect of his duties as non-executive Chairman of that Company.

The Group has entered into a lease with Charles Wells Limited, on an arms length basis, with an annual rent of 73,850 per annum.
In addition, the Group purchased products with a value totalling 576,000 2005: 414,000 from Wells & Youngs Limited, a subsidiary of Charles Wells Limited, during the year, on an arms length basis.
No balance was directly outstanding at the year end.
Alan M. Jackson received no remuneration or compensation in respect of these transactions.
Remuneration in respect of key management personnel, defined as the Directors for this purpose, is disclosed in note 6.
Further information concerning the Directors remuneration is provided in the Directors remuneration report on pages 24 to 29, of which pages 27 to 29 are audited.
