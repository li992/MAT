FIVE YEAR SUMMARY OF RESULTS 31 December 2006 Results for 2002 and 2003 are presented under UK GAAP in existence at 31 December 2004.
Results for 2004 to 2006 have been prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as approved by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Certain of these IFRS were only effective from 1 January 2005, and therefore were not used to restate the 2004 statutory based results.
The 2004 statutory results presented therefore reflect only those standards which permitted or required retrospective adoption, reflecting the voluntary exemptions of IFRS1.
As a result of some IFRS not being required to be implemented until 1 January 2005, to aid comparability of future results with those of 2004, 2004 results were also prepared on a proforma basis, incorporating the impact of IFRS where it was possible to determine what the impact would have been if the accounting changes had been effective in 2004.
The proforma results shown for 2004 included the impacts of changes to accounting rules relating to effective interest rate and the reclassification of certain financial instruments from debt to equity, but excluded the effects of hedge accounting under IFRS which differs from that applied under UK GAAP.
The 2005 statutory results included the full effects of the introduction of fair value and hedge accounting following the adoption of IAS 32 and 39 with effect from 1 January 2005.
An underlying set of results for 2005 and 2006 have also been presented which reflect managements view of the underlying results excluding the effects of fair value volatility and hedge ineffectiveness in order to provide a clearer representation of the underlying performance of the Group.
Further explanation of the proforma and underlying results is provided in the Operating and Business Review on pages 34 to 54.
