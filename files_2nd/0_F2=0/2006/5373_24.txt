Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets The Group tests goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill or intangible assets might be impaired.
No impairment of goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets was recognised in 2006 2005: 1m.
Goodwill acquired in the acquisitions of Scottish Radio Holdings plc SRH, Worth Global Style Network Limited WGSN, DeHavilland Information Services plc DeHavilland, Donegal Highland Radio Limited Highland Radio and JANGIL SA JANGIL have been allocated to the group of assets or cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
When testing for impairment, recoverable amounts for all of the Groups CGUs were measured at their value in use by discounting the future expected cash ows from the assets in the CGUs.
These calculations use cash ow projections based on management approved budgets and the Groups five year plan and, in the case of businesses acquired in the year, the cash ow projections are consistent with the business acquisition plans.
Cash ows beyond the initial five year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 2.25% which is ination only.
The cash ows have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 13%, the Groups current cost of capital.
These assumptions have been used for all CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
The most significant amounts of goodwill allocated to separate CGUs are 147m 2005: 33m allocated to the group of assets which generate cash ows from business-to-business international activities, and 278m 2005: 102m allocated to the group of assets which generate cash ows from radio activities in the UK.
No other goodwill balances allocated to other CGUs, 80m 2005: 71m, are individually significant to the Groups total goodwill balance.
