NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT 2 MARCH 2006 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 2 March 2006 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 24 April 2006.
Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in note 4.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the first time and the comparatives have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP to comply with IFRS, except for IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which have been applied from 4 March 2005.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 1, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible xed asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated accounts from or up to the date that control passes respectively.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
IT software IT software is amortised, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, estimated between three and 10 years.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
Other Other intangible assets comprise the brand name and franchise fee agreement acquired with the Premier Lodge business.
They are amortised over periods of up to 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment Prior to the 1999 2000 financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis.
Since this date the Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the nancing of major projects are capitalised until the time that they are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years.
PAGE 24 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 2 Accounting policies continued Plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the value of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reect the dierence between net selling price and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease payments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identiable cash ows that are largely independent of the cash ows of other groups of assets.
If such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
For the purposes of impairment testing all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to cash generating units CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles For the purposes of the impairment review of goodwill and intangibles the Group considers that these CGUs be at brand level.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at brand level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount of goodwill is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be all trading outlets.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative distribution line items.
Consideration is also given where appropriate to the market value of the asset, either from independent sources, or in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation methodology as mentioned above.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of nished goods includes appropriate overheads.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
Provisions Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the eect is material using a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 25 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED AT 2 MARCH 2006 2 Accounting policies continued Exceptional items The Group presents on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better assess trends in financial performance.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment are reported within operating exceptional items.
Certain exceptional costs are classied as non-operating costs where they are not part of the normal operating business of the Group, such items include profit or loss on sale of businesses and investments.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Day-to-day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in sterling at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation dierences on monetary items are taken to the income statement except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge, then translation dierences are taken directly to equity.
The dierences that arise from translating the results of overseas businesses at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a euro functional currency.
These are translated into sterling in the Group accounts.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition Generally, revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting discounts and sales-based taxes.
The following is a description of the composition of revenues of the Group: Sale of goods Sale of food and beverages revenue is recognised when food and beverages are sold.
Franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names.
Revenue is recognised when earned.
Leisure club subscriptions subscriptions are recognised over the period that membership relates to.
Royalties Royalties are recognised as the income is earned.
Rendering of services Owned hotel revenue including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from a network of hotels.
Revenue is recognised when rooms are occupied and food and beverage is sold.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues using the eective interest method.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive the payment is established.
Cash ows are included net of recoverable VAT.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benets of ownership of the asset are classied as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the nancing of major projects which, under the allowed alternative treatment, are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
PAGE 26 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 2 Accounting policies continued Retirement benets In respect of dened benefit pension schemes, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation as adjusted for any unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benets is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For dened benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within other finance costs.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the eect of fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benets paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups dened benefit plan are recognised in the period that the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to dened contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payment transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees are measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 January 2005.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of all temporary timing dierences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts, that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary timing dierence arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, aects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary dierences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary dierences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary dierences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary timing dierences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are established through an interest in a company a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.

The accounting policies applied to the comparative period are disclosed in note 39 h. Other financial assets Investments in available-for-sale assets are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised directly in equity, until the investment is disposed of or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or Group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the dierence between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash ows.
The discount rate is the original eective rate of interest.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in administrative costs.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be objectively related to an event occuring after the impairment loss is recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Assets carried at cost If there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the dierence between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash ows.
Available-for-sale financial assets If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the dierence between its cost and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are taken through the income statement, if the loss can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classied as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written o when identied.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any dierence between the amount initially recorded and the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the eective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Hedges are classied as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash ow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash ows, that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly eective.
Gains or losses from remeasuring fair value hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, are recorded in the income statement, together with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments attributable to the hedged risk.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the income statement such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
PAGE 28 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 2 Accounting policies continued The portion of any gains or losses of cash ow hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be eective hedges, are recognised directly in equity.
The gains or losses relating to the ineective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a rm committment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash ow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a rm commitment that is hedged aects the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash ow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments The recognition of financial instruments occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all the cash ows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party.
significant accounting judgements and estimates Estimation uncertainty impairment of goodwill Key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation, at the balance sheet date have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash ows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present values of those cash ows.
The carrying values of goodwill are disclosed in more detail in note 13.
Changes in accounting policies The Group has adopted IFRS for the first time this year and comparative amounts have been restated unless a specic exemption from doing so is allowed under the transitional rules for those standards.
The Group has decided to apply the exemption allowed by IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Reporting Standards and not apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to comparative information.
Instead UK GAAP has continued to be applied to financial instruments that fall within the scope of these standards.
Under the provisions of IFRS 1 this is classied as a change in accounting policy as at 4 March 2005, the date at which the standards were adopted by the Group.
The main adjustments that the Group would have made if the comparatives were made to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 are as follows: Derivative financial instruments would have been recognised on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value during the year reported within the income statement.
Where applicable hedge accounting would have been applied which for a cash ow hedge and a hedge of a net foreign investment would see the eective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative recognised directly in equity via a hedge reserve.
Fair value hedges would require the carrying amount of the related hedged item to be adjusted for the change in fair value of the hedged risk.
These changes would be reported via the income statement, hence the ineective portion of the hedge would be reported in the profit for the period.

Property, plant and equipment The Group considers each trading outlet to be a cash-generating unit CGU and each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash ow model.
The future cash ows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five year period.
Cashows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate 2004 5: 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The discount rate employed is the Groups estimated weighted average cost of capital before tax and reects the relevant risks of the assets being tested for impairment.
The discount rate used for 2005 6 is 9%.
The resultant impairment losses are 22.1m 2004 5: 14.3m as shown in the table above.
Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at brand level, being the level management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
This is calculated using the five year business plans approved by senior management.
The discount rate applied to cash ow projections are 9% 2004 5: 11%.
The resultant impairment review results in a full write-o of the 5.8m goodwill allocated to David Lloyd Leisure, 2004 5: 17.2m relating to Marriott brands and no impairment of the Premier Travel Inn goodwill carrying value of 60.5m.
PAGE 42 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 15 Impairment continued IT software Following a material change in the shape and size of the Group following the disposal of Marriott a potential indicator of impairment was deemed to have occurred.
In assessing whether the asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of each group of CGUs including allocations of corporate assets and net of any property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairments is compared with the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs.
This rate does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The resultant cashow calculations require an impairment charge of 7.3m which has been booked in the current year.

These comprise of investments in unlisted ordinary shares and deferred consideration for property disposals.
On 20 February 2006 the Group disposed of its primary investment in a venture capital partnership.
The remaining investments have no xed maturity date or coupon rate and as a result they are not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
Deferred consideration on the disposal of Swallow branded hotels during 2003 4, is in substance a loan made to the purchasing counterparties with a variable rate of interest charged.
The deferred consideration will be repaid in two instalments, 2.2m in September 2007 and 3.0m in September 2008.
Currently, available-for-sale investments held by the Group have no quoted market price.
Fair value is determined by reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash ows of the underlying net asset base of the investment.
Available-for-sale financial assets are classied as non-current assets, unless they are expected to be realised within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
No gains or losses relating to the above have been recognised directly in equity.

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, debentures, cash and short-term deposits.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations.
PAGE 48 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and oors are used to achieve the desired mix of xed and oating rate debt.
The Groups policy is to x or cap a proportion of projected net interest costs over the next five years.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate uctuations.
In addition the Group swaps certain xed rate debt into oating rates to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment.
At the year end, 342.4m 33.6% of Group net sterling debt was xed for an average of 3.8 years, using xed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
The average rate of interest on this xed rate sterling debt was 7.23%.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end, a 1% change in interest rates would aect costs by approximately 7.6m.
Liquidity risk The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing the cash generation of its operations, combined with bank borrowings and longterm debt.
In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and exibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans, debentures and preference shares.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities xed at no more than three months.
Short-term exibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivatives is limited because the Group only maintains liquid funds, and only enters into derivative transactions, with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.
The Group also spreads liquid assets over a number of counterparties to ensure there is no significant exposure to credit risk.
26 Financial instruments Under the transitional rules allowed under IFRS, IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments have been adopted from 4 March 2005 and comparative amounts have not been restated and hence interest rate swaps are not carried on the balance sheet at 3 March 2005.
Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash ows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.

Functional currencies of Group operations The currency funding for overseas net investments is denominated in a currency which is dierent from the functional currency of Whitbread PLC.
There are no other material monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the entity owning them.
Exchange gains and losses on currency funding for overseas net investments are dealt with in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.

34 Share based payment plans Long Term Incentive Plan and Uplift awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 5.
At the 2004 AGM shareholder approval was granted to replace the long-term incentive plan LTIP with an uplift awards plan.
The uplift plan awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group.
Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return TSR performance targets over a three year period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP and the uplift awards scheme can be seen in the remuneration policy on pages 8 to 11.
The options are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share options and the related weighted average exercise prices WAEP are as follows: 2006 2005 WAEP WAEP Options per share Options per share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 477,477 6.23 534,822 5.84 Granted during the year 76,926 9.04 128,327 7.54 Exercised during the year 144,240 6.36 118,144 6.35 Expired during the year 230,084 5.58 67,528 5.41 Outstanding at the end of the year 180,079 8.16 477,477 6.23 Exercisable at the end of the year 175,417 6.36 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 55 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED AT 2 MARCH 2006 34 Share based payment plans continued Deferred Equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 5.

No changes will be made to options already granted.
An earnings per share based performance condition will apply to any such options, and to the extent that the performance is not satisfied after three years, the option shall lapse, i. e. no opportunity to retest performance will be allowed.
This will be the case for the options granted in 2004 and 2005, for which the performance target will require earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% over the three year performance period.
For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions require the Companys adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the ten year performance period starting from June 2000 and ending June 2013 depending on when the options were granted.

These options have not been subsequently modied and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 2 March 2006 is between 5 and 6 years.
Employee share scheme The employee share save scheme is open to employees with the required minimum period of service and provides for a purchase price equal to the market price on the date of grant, less a 20% discount.
The shares can be purchased over the six-month period following the 3rd or 5th anniversary of the commencement date, depending on the length chosen by the employee.

Also it is assumed that 5% of participants exercise each year as a minimum if options are in the money.
Expected volatility reects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The risk free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity-incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which in most cases is the historic dividend yield.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP The Company funds an ESOP to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
The ESOP currently holds 0.9m shares.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOP are waived by the Trustee.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 57 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED AT 2 MARCH 2006 35 Retirement benets Dened contribution schemes The Group operated a dened contribution pension scheme which was closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
A replacement, contracted-in, dened contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with eect from 1 April 2002.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above dened contribution schemes, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to dened contribution schemes in the year was 11.0m 2004 5: 24.0m.
At the year end 1,111 employees were active members of the scheme.
Dened benefit schemes The dened benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
The scheme is funded and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
At the year end 2,258 employees were active members of the scheme which also had 28,529 deferred pensioners and 14,937 pensions in payment.
The pension cost relating to the dened benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with the actuarial advice from Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit credit valuation basis.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement, although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The pension cost for the year has been based on the latest actuarial valuation which was carried out as at 31 March 2005.
The assumptions were derived from market yields.
Separate assumptions were made for the discount rate used to value liabilities and the return expected on the assets.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The Board announced in April 2003 that the Company had signed an agreement with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited.
This agreement was updated in October 2005.
Under the agreement, the Company has undertaken to fund the pension scheme for a period of up to 15 years and given undertakings to the trustees similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to a value of 300m.
As a consequence of the agreement, during the year ended 2 March 2006, 62.5m of ordinary contributions and 50m of special contributions were paid by Whitbread Group PLC into the dened benefit plan.
The Group expects to contribute a further 190m over the next five years including 50m per annum during the financial years 2006 7, 2007 8 and 2008 9.
PAGE 58 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 35 Retirement benets continued The principal assumptions used by the independent qualied actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of the UK schemes to 2 March 2006 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 2 March 3 March 2006 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% 4.2% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.6% 2.6% Discount rate 4.8% 5.4% Ination assumption 2.7% 2.7% The average life expectancies for members aged 65 are set out below.
The column labelled experience is the life expectancy based on the mortality rates experienced by the Fund pensioners over the intervaluation period.
The current pensioner and future pensioner columns show the allowance for future improvements in life expectancy made in the valuation: Current Future Experience pensioner pensioner years years years Male Non-retail 16.6 17.8 20.0 Male Retail 15.4 16.5 18.8 Female Non-retail 19.4 20.6 22.7 Female Retail 18.0 19.2 21.3 The mortality assumptions above are derived from the Funds measured experience of mortality rates over many years, which are generally higher than in other pension schemes, inuenced by the Groups pubs and brewing heritage.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 3.3% per annum above ination.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is eight years.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of dened benefit schemes is as follows: 2005 6 2004 5 m m Current service cost 9.5 12.5 Past service cost 0.5 Curtailments 5.5 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 4.0 13.0 Expected return on scheme assets 65.5 61.0 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 72.5 72.0 Other finance costs note 8 7.0 11.0 The net finance cost is reported within interest expense.
The current and past service cost has been included in administrative expenses, the net finance cost has been recognised within interest costs.

In accordance with the disclosure requirements of the amended standard, the Group is phasing in the five-year history of experience adjustments, commencing with the date of transition to IFRS.
A three-year history is presented below: 2006 2005 2004 m m m Dened benefit obligations 1,576.0 1,357.0 1,318.0 Fair value of scheme assets 1,238.0 1,011.0 952.0 deficit in the scheme 338.0 346.0 366.0 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 17.5 4.5 6.0 Percentage of scheme liabilities 1.1% 0.3% 0.5% Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount m 105.5 33.0 118.0 Percentage of scheme assets 8.5% 3.3% 12.4% The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 4 March 2004 in the Group statement of recognised income and expenses is 67.9m 2005: 25.6m.
The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of 366m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of these pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statements of recognised income and expense before 4 March 2004.

Transactions with other related parties Details of transactions with Directors are detailed in the remuneration report on pages 8 to 17.
38 Events after the balance sheet date On 9 March 2006, Whitbread PLC entered into an agreement to acquire the business and assets of seven Holiday Inn branded hotels from wholly owned subsidiaries of LRG Acquisition Limited for a total consideration of 34.5m.
The seven hotels are being converted to Premier Travel Inn.
On 21 April 2006 Whitbread PLC announced the completion of the Marriott sale process, with the hotel assets held by a joint venture being acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
As a result of this transaction the carrying value of the joint venture assets held for sale in the 2005 6 accounts has been adjusted see note 10.
The completion of the disposal in 2006 7 may result in a small balancing charge.
A final dividend of 19.95p per share 2005: 18.35p amounting to a dividend of 51.7m 2005: 54.6m was declared by the Directors at their meeting on 24 April 2006.
These financial statements do not reect this dividend payable.
PAGE 62 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 39 Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 3 March 2005 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 5 March 2004.
A reconciliation of equity at 5 March 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, and at 3 March 2005 was provided in the IFRS restatement document issued on 3 August 2005.
A reconciliation of profit for the year ended 3 March 2005 was also published within that document.
A copy of these documents can be found on the Companys website at www.
These are unchanged except for the IAS 12 adjustment described below and the reclassication of the revaluation reserve to retained earnings.
IAS 12 requires the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which it is expected, at the balance sheet date, to recover the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
The Company has reconsidered the eect of this requirement on various properties acquired as part of a business combination and as a result recognised an additional deferred tax liability of 7.7m at 5 March 2004.
As Whitbread has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 relating to business combinations, recognition of this amount results in an equivalent reduction in equity.

The IFRS cash ow statement is presented in a dierent format from that required under UK GAAP with cash ows split into three categories of activities operating activities, investing activities and nancing activities.
The reconciling items between the UK GAAP presentation and the IFRS presentation have no net impact on the cash ows generated.
In preparing the cash ow under IFRS, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, highly liquid interest bearing securities with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Under UK GAAP highly liquid interest bearing securities were not classied as cash equivalents.
The transition to IFRS resulted in the following significant changes in accounting policies: a IFRS 3 Business combinations Under UK GAAP the Group goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill, requiring goodwill to be measured at cost less impairment losses and tested for impairment annually.
Hence under IFRS the Group will carry goodwill on the balance sheet subsequent to initial recognition at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill will be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if the circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.
In future any negative goodwill will be written o immediately to the income statement.
The eect of the change is an increase in equity and intangible assets at 3 March 2005 of 7.3m.
The change does not aect equity at 5 March 2004. profits before tax for the year ended 3 March 2005 are increased by 7.3m.
There is no associated tax impact.
At the date of transition to IFRS goodwill was subject to a mandatory impairment review.
b IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations IFRS 5 requires that where the value of an asset will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use that the assets are classied as held for sale.
Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of book value and fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
Under UK GAAP there is no held for sale denition and no reclassication is required.
At 5 March 2004 a 0.9m provision was recorded, and charged to retained earnings, to adjust the carrying value of the assets down to their fair value less costs to sell.
Assets held for sale at 3 March 2005 have increased to 992.3m, which is mainly due to the inclusion of the carrying value of xed assets disposed of on 5 May 2005 as part of the Marriott sale.
At 5 March 2004 0.2m was recognised as held for sale, which related to a small number of restaurant properties being sold.
c IAS 19 Employee benets Under UK GAAP SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the average expected service life of current employees.
Actuarial surpluses and deficits are amortised over the expected remaining service lives of current employees.
Any dierences between the amount charged to the profit and loss account and payments made to the schemes are treated as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet.
IAS 19 requires recognition of the operating and finance costs of dened benefit plans in the income statement, with the option to recognise actuarial gains and losses in a statement of changes in equity titled Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The Group accounting policies under IFRS adopt this approach.
PAGE 64 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 39 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued At 5 March 2004 under UK GAAP there was a 51.7m pension scheme prepayment as calculated in accordance with SSAP 24.
This balance is removed under IFRS and replaced with the 366.0m scheme liability as determined in accordance with IAS 19.
This change in policy also results in the derecognition of a 9.6m deferred tax liability as calculated under SSAP 24, and the recognition of a 109.8m deferred tax asset under IAS 19 which is netted o against other deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet.
The eect on the balance sheet as at 3 March 2005 is to remove the 67.7m pension scheme prepayment asset as calculated in accordance with SSAP 24, and replace it with a scheme liability of 346.0m as determined in accordance with IAS 19.
The SSAP 24 deferred tax liability of 18.5m is derecognised and replaced with a 103.8m deferred tax asset as calculated under IAS 19, which again is netted o against other deferred tax liabilities in the balance sheet.
The eect of adopting IAS 19 on the income statement is a decrease in profit before tax of 17.5m and a reduction to the tax charge of 5.3m for the financial year ended 3 March 2005. d IFRS 2 Share-based payments Previously under UK GAAP, the Group writes-o the intrinsic value at the date of the grant over the vesting period.
The cost of shares acquired is taken directly to shareholders funds.
The scope of IFRS 2 is wider than previous UK GAAP as it relates to all share-based payment transactions, not just those made to employees, and there is also no exemption for SAYE schemes.
IFRS 2 requires that for equity-settled transactions with employees, the fair value of the employee services received should be measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date.
The charge is spread over the vesting period, this diers from UK GAAP where the charge is spread over the performance period where employees have to satisfy specic performance conditions.
The eect on profit before tax is a net charge of 3.3m made up of an IFRS 2 charge of 4.1m and a UK GAAP reversal of 0.8m for the financial year ended 3 March 2005.
There is an associated deferred tax credit of 1.4m bringing the overall impact on profit after tax to a charge of 1.9m.
e IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Previously under UK GAAP, Group dividends declared after the balance sheet date have been recognised as a liability.
Under IFRS dividends declared after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
The eect of the change is an increase in equity of 47.8m at 5 March 2004 and 54.6m at 3 March 2005.
The change does not aect profit or loss reported under IFRS for the financial year ended 3 March 2005.
f IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures and IAS 28 Investments in associates The Group will account for joint ventures and associates in line with IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and IAS 28 Investments in Associates respectively.
The Groups share of investments in joint ventures and associates has been reduced by 1.8m and 20.5m respectively at 4 March 2004 and 2.3m and 23.2m respectively at 3 March 2005 to reect the re-statement of joint venture and associate balance sheets at the date of transition to IFRS.
The adjustments primarily relate to the recognition of pension scheme liabilities in accordance with IAS 19. g IAS 12 Income taxes The Groups IAS 12 amendments are netted o and aect those deferred tax assets or liabilities which taken together comprise the net deferred tax liability at the balance sheet date.
The impact implementing IFRS has on the deferred tax liability is an increase of 23.0m and 81.0m at 5 March 2004 and at 3 March 2005 respectively.
In addition to the adjustments above made to deferred tax, further adjustments that have been made as a result of implementing IAS 12 are outlined below: The standard requires a deferred tax provision for all capital gains that have been subject to rollover relief claims.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was only provided on assets subject to such claims to the extent that the liability was expected to crystallise.
This has resulted in the creation of a deferred tax liability of 95.1m and 97.1m as at 5 March 2004 and 3 March 2005 respectively.
The creation of a deferred tax liability for revaluation gains was not permitted under UK GAAP, however, it is required under IAS 12.
Although the Group has not revalued its properties since the 1999 2000 financial year, and does not intend to revalue properties going forward, the revalued carrying amounts at the date of transition to IFRS will form the deemed costs under IFRS.
A transitional deferred tax liability is therefore required at 5 March 2004 amounting to 43.4m and 44.1m at 3 March 2005.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 65 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED AT 2 MARCH 2006 39 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the acquisition of Premier Travel Inn required fair valuing giving rise to a deferred tax liability of 60.0m and a goodwill adjustment for the same value as at 3 March 2005.
A deferred tax asset of 3.4m has been recognised in respect of discounted provisions relating to below market rent adjustments in existence at the date of transition to IFRS.
This has increased to 3.8m as at 3 March 2005.
The Group has reconsidered the eect of this requirement on various properties acquired as part of a business combination and as a result recognised an additional deferred tax liability of 7.7m at 5 March 2004 and 3 March 2005.
The above changes increase the deferred tax liability as follows: 2005 2004 m m Recognised under UK GAAP 165.4 152.6 Derecognition of SSAP 24 pension scheme asset 18.5 9.6 Deferred tax provision for rolled over capital gains 97.1 95.1 Deferred tax provision for previously revalued properties 44.1 43.4 Deferred tax provision for Premier Travel Inn 60.0 Adjustment see above 7.7 7.7 Increase in deferred tax liability 190.4 136.6 Recognition of IAS 19 dened benefit pension scheme liability 103.8 109.8 Recognition of share-based payments 1.8 0.4 Recognition of deferred tax on discounted provisions 3.8 3.4 Recognition of deferred tax asset 109.4 113.6 Net deferred tax liability increase 81.0 23.0 Recognised under IFRS 246.4 175.6 h Financial instruments: application of IAS 32 and 39 The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with eect from 4 March 2005, and as permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has not restated comparative information.
The new accounting policies as applied for the year ended 2 March 2006 are set out in note 2.
For accounting periods up to the year ended 3 March 2005 the following accounting policies were applied in respect of financial instruments in the financial statements of the Group: Derivative instruments Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group for the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Gains or losses on foreign currency forward and option contracts are recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs.
In the balance sheet, payments made to secure a hedge are included with the hedged item to which they relate.
Option premiums paid are recognised in the income statement over the life of the contract.
Premiums and discounts arising on financial liabilities are amortised over the remaining life of the instrument concerned.
Nature of the main adjustments to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been applied from 5 March 2004 the following adjustments would have been necessary in the financial statements for the year ended 3 March 2005: all derivatives would have been brought onto the balance sheet at fair value: available for sale investments would have been carried at fair value rather than at cost: and the liability component of minority owned preference shares would have been reclassied from equity to non-current liabilities.
