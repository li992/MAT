Significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the financial statements except as noted below: Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards except for certain financial instruments as defined by FRS26: Financial instruments : measurement which are stated at fair value.
The Company has not presented a separate profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Under FRS1 Cash flow statements, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Company is included in its own published consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained in FRS8 Related party disclosures and has not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation included in the profit and loss account.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheets date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
89 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 notes to the financial statements C1.
Significant accounting policies continued Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Company participates in a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS17 Retirement benefits: accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contribution payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Financial instruments The principal financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the Groups risk management policy.
Interest differentials are taken to net interest in the profit and loss account.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a SAYE Share Option Scheme and a Performance Share Plan.
For options granted on or after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options at the date of grant is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Dividends or shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
