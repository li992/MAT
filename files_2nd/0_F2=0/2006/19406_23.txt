28. profit for the year As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the pro t and loss account of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The pro t for the year attributable to equity shareholders dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was 11,342,000 2005: 13,038,000.
The Company had no employees in the year 2005: none.
29. accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
i basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the historical cost accounting rules.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own pro t and loss account.
In accordance with the exemption in FRS 1, Cash Flow Statements, the Company has not prepared a cash ow statement because one is included in its own consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8, Related Party Transactions, from the requirement to disclose such transactions on the grounds that it has presented its own consolidated financial statements.
ii adoption of new standards In these financial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the first time: FRS 21, Events after the Balance Sheet Date: FRS 23, The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure: FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Measurement: and FRS 28, Corresponding Amounts.
The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below together with an indication of the effects of their adoption.
The corresponding amounts in these financial statements are, other than those covered by the exemption permitted by FRS 25 and FRS 26, restated in accordance with the new policies.
FRS 25 and FRS 26 permit the corresponding amounts not to be restated and the Company has adopted this approach.
The financial instrument policy set out below in note 36 provides further details of the current and prior year bases and of the change booked on 1 April 2005.
The effect of changes in the other accounting policies on the current and prior year is: FRS 21 requires that final dividends payable are recognised only in the period in which they are approved in the Annual General Meeting and therefore become a liability and interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
This accounting treatment has superseded SSAP 17, Accounting for Post Balance Sheet Events which required dividends to be accrued for when proposed.
This change in policy has resulted in an increase of 674,000 in the retained pro t for the year ended 31 March 2006 2005: 943,000 and an increase in net assets of 9,374,000 2005: 8,700,000.
The adoption of FRS 23 has had no material effect on the accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2006 or the prior year.
FRS 28 has had no material effect as it imposes the same requirements for comparatives as hitherto required by the Companies Act 1985. quintain estates and development plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 march 2006 87 notes to the accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2006 29. accounting policies continued iii Turnover and cost of sales Turnover is stated net of VAT and comprises fees and commissions.
iv tangible fixed assets These assets comprise head of ce xtures, ttings and equipment and are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
v investments Investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
vi foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the pro t and loss account.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
vii leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the pro t and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
viii taxation The charge for taxation is based on the pro t for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, for all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19, Deferred Taxation.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
ix own shares held by esop trusts Transactions of the ESOP Trusts are included in the financial statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchase of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

In the comparative period, all financial assets and liabilities were carried at cost, amortised as appropriate, less, in the case of financial assets, provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Interest differentials arising from interest rate swaps were recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the period of the contract.
The following adjustments necessary to implement the revised policy have been made as at 1 April 2005 with net adjustments to net assets, after tax, taken through the current year shareholders funds.
Corresponding amounts for the year ended 31 March 2005 are presented and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and FRS 4, Capital Instruments.

In prior periods, hedging instruments were not recognised and hedged items were held at cost, amortised as appropriate, without any adjustment in respect of the hedged risk.
b Of the previous carrying value of the convertible debt, a portion has been treated as a share subscription option and has been transferred directly to reserves on 1 April 2005.
Thereafter, the finance cost of the debt is higher.
