NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Presentation of financial statements General information The principal activities of Tate & Lyle PLC are the development, manufacture and marketing of food and industrial ingredients that have been made from renewable resources.
The Group operates more than 65 production facilities in 29 countries, and in numerous partnerships and joint ventures, located predominantly in Europe, the Americas and in South East Asia.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Company has its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements are presented for the first time on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and have been prepared in accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Services Authority, and the Companies Act 1985, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Until 31 March 2005 the consolidated financial statements of the Group had been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards UK GAAP.
UK GAAP differs in certain respects from IFRS.
When preparing the Groups consolidated financial statements, management has amended certain accounting, valuation and consolidation methods applied in the UK GAAP financial statements to comply with IFRS.
To explain how the Groups reported financial performance and position are affected by these changes, restatements and explanations are included in notes 40 and 41.
With the exception of the adoption on 1 April 2005 of IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the consolidated comparative information in respect of the year to 31 March 2005 has also been restated to reflect these adjustments.
The effects of the adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 on the Groups equity as at 1 April 2005 are described in note 41.
The accounting policies summarised in note 2 have been applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in all periods presented except where noted below.
The following IFRSs, International Financial Reporting and Interpretations Committee IFRICs requirements and amendments thereto have been adopted earlier than required: December 2004 amendment to IAS19 Employee Benefits permitting the recognition of actuarial gains and losses directly in equity from 1 April 2004 : April 2005 amendment to IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement concerning cash flow hedges of forecast intra-group transactions from 1 April 2005 : June 2005 amendment to IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement concerning the fair value option from 1 April 2005.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except in respect of certain financial instruments and commodities.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the Groups presentation currency.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity and areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
The following IFRSs and IFRICs have been issued but have not been early adopted by the Group: IFRIC4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease effective from 1 April 2006 requires the determination of whether an arrangement contains a lease.
The adoption is expected to result in the recognition of additional property, plant and equipment and the related payables.
The impact on the Groups financial statements is still under review.
IFRIC7 Applying the restatement approach effective from 1 April 2006 provides guidance on hyperinflation accounting.
The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS7 Financial instruments: Disclosures effective from 1 April 2007 introduces new disclosures for financial instruments.
It replaces requirements in IAS32 Financial instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and will introduce additional disclosures in the Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007.
The parent company, Tate & Lyle PLC has not adopted IFRS as its statutory reporting basis.
Audited financial statements for the parent company, prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, are set out on pages 124 to 132.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 71 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Group accounting policies Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights and taking into account the existence of potential voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The recognised identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All inter-company transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
b Joint ventures An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies.
The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by proportionate consolidation, whereby the Groups share of the joint ventures income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows are combined on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint ventures to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The Group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets to the joint venture that is attributable to the other venturers.
The Group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the Groups purchase of assets from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an external entity.
c Associates An entity is regarded as an associate if the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
Associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups income statement includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is its presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
c Group entities From 1 April 2004, the results and financial position of all the Groups entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments for each balance sheet presented, are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates as a reasonable approximation to the rates prevailing on the transaction dates: and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Prior to 1 April 2004, exchange differences were recognised in retained earnings.
72 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 2 Group accounting policies continued On consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences that have accumulated since 1 April 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings comprise mainly manufacturing sites and administrative facilities.
Certain items of land and buildings are carried at amounts based upon valuations recognised in accordance with UK GAAP prior to the Groups adoption of IFRS.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost or revalued amount of each asset to its residual value over its useful economic life as follows: Freehold land: No depreciation Freehold buildings: 20 to 50 years Leasehold property: Period of the lease Bulk liquid storage tanks: 12 to 20 years Plant and machinery: 3 to 28 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted if appropriate.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater that its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the income statement.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
Leased assets Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding leasing commitments, net of finance charges, are included in liabilities.
Leasing payments are analysed between capital and interest components so that the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability outstanding.
Depreciation on assets held under finance leases is charged to the income statement.
All other leases are treated as operating leases with annual rentals charged to the income statement, net of any incentives granted to the lessee, over the term of the lease.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration exchanged, including directly attributable acquisition costs, and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is capitalised.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Where the acquired interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Contingent receipts represent amounts receivable under the terms of the 2004 realignment of the Sucralose business and are deducted from the related goodwill.
When such goodwill is eliminated, receipts are recognised in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business component include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 73 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Group accounting policies continued b Patents and other intellectual property Patents and other intellectual property are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Where the assets are acquired as part of a business combination, historical cost is based on their fair values as at the date of the combination.
Amortisation of the assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit.
c Other acquired intangible assets Other acquired intangible assets are intangible assets arising on consolidation of acquired businesses and include brands, recipes, customer relationships and supplier networks.
d Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly includes certain development expenditure and software costs.
Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets when the IAS38 recognition criteria are met.
Capitalised development costs are amortised from the commencement of the commercial production of the product on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit.
Research and other development expenditures are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets other than goodwill are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows.
Goodwill is allocated to units representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Groups Board of Directors for internal management purposes.
Further details are given in note 3.
Financial instruments As explained in note 1, the Group adopted IAS32 and IAS39 for the year ended 31 March 2006 onwards and elected not to restate comparative information.
The accounting policies applied to the Groups financial instruments from 1 April 2005 are set out below.
Prior to adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 Financial Instruments were accounted for under UK GAAP.
The accounting policy previously applied under UK GAAP is set out in note 41 which explains the impacts of the adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 on the Groups equity as at 1 April 2005. a Available-for-sale financial assets Equity instruments held by the Group and designated as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised directly in equity.
b Loans and receivables Non-current receivables and loans granted are carried at amortised cost less provisions for impairment.
Movements in carrying value are recognised in the income statement.
c Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
d Commodity trading instruments Commodity instruments acquired for trading purposes are carried at fair value.
Movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
e Commodity and treasury hedging instruments Under IAS39, hedging relationships are categorised by type and must meet strict criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.
i Cash flow hedges Hedges of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions, including forecast intra-group transactions that are expected to affect consolidated profit or loss, are designated as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that movements in the fair values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity until the period during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in the income statement, offsetting the value of the hedged transaction.
74 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 2 Group accounting policies continued ii Fair value hedges Hedges against the movement in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities are designated as fair value hedges.
To the extent that movements in the fair values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the income statement by offset against the hedged transaction.
iii Hedges of net investments Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are designated as net investment hedges.
To the extent that movements in the fair values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the translation reserve until the period during which a foreign operation is disposed of or partially disposed of, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss, offsetting the cumulative difference recognised on the translation of the net investment.
Hedge accounting is discontinued at the point when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
In the case of cash flow hedging relationships, the cumulative movement in the fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity up to that point is retained there until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss, unless the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, in which case the cumulative movement in fair value is transferred to profit or loss immediately.
Movements in the fair value of hedging instruments where the instrument failed to meet the IAS39 hedge accounting criteria or where the movement represents the ineffective portion of a qualifying hedging relationship are recognised in the income statement immediately as other income and expense or net finance expense, as appropriate.
f Embedded derivatives Where an embedded derivative is not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract itself is not already recognised at fair value, movements in the fair value of the embedded derivative are separated from the associated transaction and, except where the embedded derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, recognised in the income statement.
g Fair valuation Fair values are based on market values where they are available.
For unlisted securities the Group establishes fair value using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other similar instruments and discounted cash flow analysis.
Inventories Except for those items noted below, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the first in first out or weighted average cost methods, appropriate to the materials and production processes involved.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Certain items of merchandisable agricultural commodities are stated at market value, in line with regional industry accounting practices.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts which are not considered to be borrowings in nature.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury shares or indirectly within an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
These shares are used to satisfy share options granted to employees under the Groups share option schemes.
The trustee purchases the Companys shares on the open market using loans made by the Company or other loans guaranteed by the Company.
Provisions Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably measured.
If the effect is material, provisions are measured using expected future cash flows discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 75 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Group accounting policies continued Income taxes The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-taxable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Employee benefits a Pension obligations Group companies operate various pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans are the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains or losses and past service costs charged or credited to equity.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group has elected to apply the 2004 amendment to IAS19, Employee Benefits, with effect from 1 April 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity immediately.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Other post-employment obligations Some Group companies provide post-employment healthcare benefits to their retirees.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
76 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 2 Group accounting policies continued c Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, for options granted with non-market vesting conditions, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
Revenue recognition a Sales of goods and services Sales comprise the amount receivable in the ordinary course of business, net of value added and sales taxes, for goods and services provided.
Sales are recognised at the point or points at which the Group has performed its obligations in connection with the contractual terms of the sales agreement, and in exchange obtains the right to consideration.
b Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
c Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Dividend distribution A dividend distribution to the Companys equity holders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, by the Board of Directors.
Exceptional items Exceptional items comprise items of income and expense that are material in amount and unlikely to recur and which merit separate disclosure in order to provide an understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
Examples of events giving rise to the disclosure of material items of income and expense as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, impairment events, disposals of operations or individual assets, litigation claims by or against the Group and the restructuring of components of the Groups operations.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 77 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements In order to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2, management has used estimates and judgements to establish the amounts at which certain items are recorded.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are those which have the greatest impact on the financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that management believe to be reasonable.
However given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be different from the assumptions used.
The critical accounting policies are set out below: Impairment of assets Asset impairments have the potential to significantly impact income.
In order to determine whether impairments are required the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
This calculation is usually based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.
A discount factor is applied to obtain a current value value in use.
The fair value less costs to sell of an asset is used if this results in an amount in excess of value in use.
Estimated future cash flows for impairment calculations are based on managements expectations of future volumes and margins based on plans and best estimates of the productivity of the assets in their current condition.
Future cash flows therefore exclude benefits from major expansion projects requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure has not been approved at the balance sheet date.
Future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted if appropriate for circumstances specific to the asset being tested.
The weighted average cost of capital is impacted by estimates of interest rates, equity returns and market and country related risks.
The Groups weighted average cost of capital is reviewed on an annual basis.
Retirement benefits Among the range of retirement benefits provided in businesses around the Group are a number of defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded healthcare benefit scheme in the United States.
The amounts recorded in the financial statements for both of these types of arrangement are based on a number of assumptions, changes to which could have a material impact on the reported amounts.
Any net deficit or surplus arising on defined benefit plans and the liability under the healthcare plan is shown in the balance sheet.
The amount recorded is the difference between plan assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Plan assets are based on market value at that date.
Plan liabilities, including healthcare liabilities, are based on actuarial estimates of the present value of future pension or other benefits that will be payable to members.
The most sensitive assumptions involved in calculating the expected liabilities are mortality rates and the discount rate used to calculate the present value.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation.
If this assumption changed by 0.1%, the gross plan liabilities would change by approximately 18 million.
The income statement generally comprises a regular charge to operating profit and a finance charge which represents the net of expected income from plan assets and an interest charge on plan liabilities.
These calculations are based on expected outcomes at the start of the financial year.
The income statement is most sensitive to changes in expected returns from plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the interest charge on plan liabilities.
A 0.1% change in the assumption of the real discount rate would change the finance expense by approximately 0.4 million.
Full details of these assumptions, which are based on advice from the Groups actuaries, are set out in note 28.
Provisions The Group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date and a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome.
Where appropriate, future cash outflows that are expected to arise over a number of years are discounted to a present value using a relevant discount rate.
At the balance sheet date provisions included amounts for insurance claims payable by the Groups reinsurance company, legal matters, employee termination costs and amounts payable under the deferred consideration clauses of the realignment of the Sucralose business in April 2004.
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for managements best current estimates the judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may be different from those provided.
Taxation The Group operates in a large number of tax jurisdictions around the world.
Tax regulations generally are complex and in some jurisdictions agreeing tax liabilities with local tax authorities can take several years.
Consequently at the balance sheet date tax liabilities and assets are based on managements best estimate of the future amounts that will be settled.
While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected.
Deferred tax assets mainly represent past tax losses that the Group expects to recover at some time in the future and by their nature the amounts recorded are therefore dependent on managements judgement about future events.
78 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 4 Segment information Primary format business segments A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
On 2 June 2005 the Group announced a change to the basis on which divisional performance is reported to reflect its evolving strategy.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information, as set out below.

12 Earnings per share Basic Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as ESOP shares.

Potential dilutive ordinary shares arise from share options.
For these, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

Under the terms of the realignment, deferred consideration is payable to McNeil Nutritionals McNeil based on the achievement of certain minimum targets in respect of sales of Sucralose made by the Group see note 29.
Expected future payments were provided for at the time of the realignment and any changes to the Groups estimates of the deferred consideration are adjusted to goodwill.
Another feature of the realignment is that the Group receives amounts from the vendor, McNeil, based on sales of Sucralose tabletop products made by McNeil for ten years from the date of the realignment.
These receipts are treated as contingent assets, only recognised in the periods in which they are earned, and are shown as a deduction from goodwill.
On elimination of goodwill the receipts are recognised in the income statement.
86 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 14 Intangible assets continued b The carrying amounts of goodwill by business segment are as follows: As at 31 March 2006 2005 m m Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas 73 57 Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe 102 87 Sucralose 8 Sugars, Europe 4 2 179 154 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
Unless otherwise stated, impairment reviews are carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in notes 2 and 3.
Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas goodwill of 73 million includes 53 million relating to the Staley acquisition, which is treated as one cash generating unit CGU for impairment testing purposes, as the business is managed as one entity and it is therefore not appropriate to allocate goodwill to individual plants.
Cash flows used were based on the latest approved plans for five years discounted at 12%.
Goodwill in the Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe division of 102 million includes 90 million relating to the acquisition in 2000, of the minority of 34% of shares of the former Amylum business.
Although cash flows have been identified for individual plants for the purposes of assessing the recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment as described in note 15 the business is managed as a network, with a large amount of interdependency between plants and centralised decision making.
Consequently goodwill is monitored at a divisional level and allocated to a group of plant CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing.
As a result of the proposed changes to the EU Sugar Regime, described in the Chief Executives Review, management has concluded that in certain markets the business is unlikely to be able to generate sufficient returns to cover its cost of capital.
As required by IAS36 the property, plant and equipment has been reviewed first, resulting in an impairment charge of 263 million as described in note 15.
Subsequently, the goodwill has been tested for impairment and the recoverable amount has been estimated based on the assets remaining after the impairment to property, plant and equipment.
Recoverable amount was based on value in use, which was calculated based on estimated future cash flows using management internal forecasts of future margins excluding the impact of any major initiatives for the next five years.
The discount rate used was 11% and zero growth was assumed in perpetuity due to the regulated nature of the market.
As a result of this review management has concluded that the recoverable amount on a value in use basis of the group of plant CGUs is greater than the remaining net book value of goodwill and assets and consequently no impairment is required.
The remaining goodwill relates to a number of smaller acquisitions, each of which has been tested for impairment using management projections for five years and discount rates in the range of 10% to 12%.
During the year goodwill of 12 million has been recognised on the acquisition of Cesalpinia Foods, part of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe and 12 million on the acquisition of Continental Custom Ingredients, part of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas as described in note 35.
No impairment losses were identified in respect of these businesses.

As a result of the forthcoming changes to the EU sugar regime, which will reduce significantly EU subsidised exports of sugar and is explained in detail in the Chief Executives Review, the Group has carried out an impairment review of the assets in Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe and Sugars, Europe.
In addition the Citric business in the UK has continued to generate returns below its cost of capital and this business has been subject to a similar review.
Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe is a major supplier of sweeteners which operate in direct competition to sugar throughout Europe.
As a result of the proposed changes to the EU sugar regime management has concluded that in certain markets the business is unlikely to be able to generate sufficient returns to cover its cost of capital.
Consequently an impairment review has been carried out by comparing the recoverable amount of the individual cash generating units with their net book values.
For the purposes of the review, individual plants were used as the relevant cash generating units except for the plants in Belgium and France for which a combined review was performed due to the operational interdependency between the two sites.
Recoverable amount was generally based on value in use, which was calculated based on estimated future cash flows using management internal forecasts of future margins excluding the impact of any major initiatives for the next five years.
For certain cash generating units the calculation of fair value less costs to sell, based on management estimates in the absence of an active market, resulted in recoverable amounts that were higher than value in use.
Consequently for those sites the recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs to sell.
As a result of the review an impairment loss of 263 million, allocated pro-rata to the asset base of the plants impacted, has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2006.
88 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 15 Property, plant and equipment continued Sugars, Europe is also impacted by the proposed changes to the sugar regime, however managements impairment review of this business did not result in an impairment loss.
The Citric business in the UK has been impacted by margin pressure from increasing raw material and energy costs.
An impairment review has been carried out and an impairment of 9 million has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2006.
Cash flows were forecast based on management plans for five years and no growth was assumed in perpetuity.
The discount rate used was 12%.
Leased assets Included in property, plant and equipment is 1 million 2005 2 million in respect of plant and machinery held under finance leases.
Capitalised borrowing costs The aggregate amount of borrowing costs included in the cost of property, plant and equipment is 44 million 2005 41 million, of which 4 million 2005 1 million was capitalised during the year.

Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of options.
iii Exercise is dependent on earnings per share performance relative to inflation over a three-year period following grant.
iv Executives have the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual cash bonus after deduction of tax, national insurance or other social security payment and invest the amount deferred in the Companys shares.
Subject to the satisfaction of employment conditions and a performance target over the performance period, participants will receive awards of matching shares based on the number of shares which could have been acquired from the gross bonus amount deferred by the participant.
During the performance period, dividends are paid on the deferred shares but not on matching shares.
Further details are set out on page 56 of the Remuneration Report.
v Options granted in the years to 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2006 were by invitation at a 10% discount to the market price.
Options are exercisable at the end of a three-year or five-year savings contract.
The Group recognised total expenses of 5 million 2005 4 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.

If the interest rates applicable to the Groups floating rate debt rise from the levels at 31 March 2006 by an average of 1% over the year to 31 March 2007, this would reduce Group profit before tax by approximately 5 million.
The exposure of the Group to interest rate changes when borrowings re-price is as follows: Within one One to two Two to five After five year years years years Total m m m m m At 31 March 2006 Total borrowings 502 4 4 518 1 028 Effect of interest rate swaps 46 242 288 548 4 246 230 1 028 As part of its interest rate management strategy, the Group has entered into interest rate caps for a notional principal amount of 209 million 2005 203 million, capping interest rates at 4% or 5% until 2009 or 2007 respectively.
Taking into account the Groups interest rate swap and cap contracts, the effective interest rates of its borrowings are as follows: 31 March 2006 2005 2,394,000 6.5% cumulative preference shares of 1 each 2005 2,394,000 6.5% 6.5% Industrial Revenue Bonds 2002-2023 US$23,700,000 3.2% 2.3% Floating Rate Note 2007 150,000,000 3.5% 3.1% 6.5% Guaranteed Note 2012 200,000,000 4.9% 3.7% 5.0% Notes 2014 US$500,000,000 4.7% 4.4% 5.75% Guaranteed Bonds 2006 300,000,000 4.7% 4.2% Short-term loans and overdrafts Current short-term loans mature within the next 12 months and overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Both short-term loans and bank overdrafts are arranged at floating rates of interest and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Credit facilities and arrangements The Group has undrawn committed multi-currency facilities of 353 million 2005 327 million which expire in 2009.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
The facilities may only be withdrawn in the event of specified events of default.
In addition, the Group has substantial uncommitted facilities.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 101 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 26 Borrowings continued At 31 March 2006, a US subsidiary had outstanding external borrowings of US$800 million, the principal amount of which is guaranteed by another Group company by way of credit-linked deposits with a bank of US$680 million and pledged bank securities of US$120 million.
The guarantees result in these borrowings being, in substance, non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and accordingly the borrowings and deposits are offset in these financial statements.
UK GAAP comparatives IAS32 was not adopted until 1 April 2005.
Comparative information with respect to the carrying values and fair values is therefore presented below under UK GAAP.

Borrowings include the effect of cross-currency swaps used in managing the Groups currency and interest rate risk.
The book value of these swaps at 31 March 2005 was 13 million asset and the fair value was 15 million asset.
The fair values of commodity derivatives are calculated as the product of the volume and the difference between their strike or traded price and the corresponding market price.
The market price is based upon the corresponding closing price of that market.
Where there is no terminal market and or the market is illiquid, the market price is based upon management estimates, taking into consideration all relevant current market and economic factors.
The interest rate exposure of the financial assets of the Group at 31 March 2005 included 108 million on non-interest bearing assets and 390 million on floating rate assets.
The currency exposure of these assets totalling 498 million was as follows: 108 million sterling : 171 million US dollars : 56 million Euro : 23 million Canadian dollars : and 140 million other.
At 31 March 2005 the total net unrecognised gains on hedges were 5 million, which included unrecognised gains of 18 million and unrecognised losses of 13 million.
27 Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions where such differences arise.

Of the amounts of deferred tax credited to income, 2 million arises from the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses, where the entities concerned have returned to profit.
Deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised tax losses of 577 million 2005 293 million have not been recognised to the extent that they exceed taxable profits against which these assets may be recovered.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of 1.3 billion 2005 1.1 billion where the Group is both able to control dividend policy and does not anticipate dividends to be remitted in the foreseeable future.

Most of these arrangements are defined benefit pension schemes with retirement, disability, death and termination income benefits.
The retirement income benefits are generally a function of years of employment and final salary.
The principal schemes are funded and their assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The schemes are funded in line with local practice and contributions are assessed in accordance with local independent actuarial advice.
The schemes operated by the Group are subject to independent actuarial valuation at regular intervals using consistent assumptions appropriate to conditions prevailing in the relevant country.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out as at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries.
The Group also maintains defined contribution pension schemes and some fully insured pension schemes and multi-employer pension arrangements.
On 1 April 2002, the main United Kingdom scheme was closed to new members.
A defined contribution pension scheme has been established to provide pension benefits to new United Kingdom employees.
Under the projected unit method, the service cost of the closed scheme will increase as the members approach retirement.
The Groups subsidiaries in the United States provide unfunded retirement medical and life assurance benefits to their employees.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 50 million to its defined benefit plans in the year to 31 March 2007. b Principal assumptions The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2006 UK US Others benefits Inflation rate 2.8% 3.5% 2.0-2.5% 3.5% Expected rate of salary increases 4.6% 4.5% 2.0-4.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 2.8% 0.0% 0.0-1.8% n a Discount rate 4.9% 6.0% 4.6-5.3% 6.0% Expected return on plan assets 6.2% 7.8% 4.5-7.0% n a Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2005 UK US Others benefits Inflation rate 2.8% 3.5% 2.0-2.5% 3.5% Expected rate of salary increases 4.5% 4.5% 2.0-4.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 2.8% 0.0% 0.0-1.8% n a Discount rate 5.4% 6.1% 4.5-5.8% 6.1% Expected return on plan assets 6.2% 8.0% 4.5-7.0% n a The following mortality tables have been used for the principal schemes.
For the UK pension scheme the Group has used PMA92CO5MC 2.5 year age rating for male pensioners and PFA92CO5MC 4.5 year age rating for female pensioners 2005 PMA8OCO3 and PA 90 F 2 year age rating.
For the US pension schemes the Group has used GAM83M for male pensioners and GAM83F for female pensioners 2005 GAM83M and GAM83F.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of plan assets are estimated by reference to indices published by the relevant exchanges.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
The actual rate of return on the plan assets for the year was 14.6% 2005 7.2%, and amounted to 173 million 2005 74 million.
Medical cost trend rates are estimated at between 8.9% and 9.5% per annum 2005 10.0-12.0%, grading down to 5% by 2015.
If medical cost trend rates were to increase or decrease by 1%, the effects are estimated as follows: 2006 2005 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease m m m m Increase decrease in medical benefits current service and interest cost 1 1 1 1 Increase decrease in medical benefits obligation 8 7 9 8 104 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 28 Retirement benefit obligations continued c Amounts recognised in the income statement Pension benefits Medical UK US Others Total benefits Total Year to 31 March 2006 m m m m m m Current service cost 1043 17 1 18 Past service cost exceptional note 8 24 24 Past service cost other 1 1 1 Charged to operating profit 10 5 3 18 23 5 Interest cost 43 15 4 62 6 68 Expected return on plan assets 45 15 5 65 65 Charged credited to finance expense 2 1 3 6 3 8 5 2 15 17 2 Pension benefits Medical UK US Others Total benefits Total Year to 31 March 2005 m m m m m m Current service cost 9 5 4 18 1 19 Past service cost 1 1 1 Charged to operating profit 10 5 4 19 1 20 Interest cost 43 14 4 61 5 66 Expected return on plan assets 44 15 4 63 63 Charged credited to finance expense 1 1 2 5 3 944 17 6 23 Current service and past service costs are presented in staff costs note 9 : expected return on plan assets and interest cost are presented in finance expense note 10.

108 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 32 Net debt The adoption of IFRS and of IAS32 and IAS39 in particular has altered the Groups net debt profile based on the definitions previously reported under UK GAAP.
Following adoption of IFRS, cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and borrowings now reflect the effects of various balance sheet reclassifications as well as the inclusion of the Groups share of joint ventures net debt.
Furthermore, derivative instruments used to manage the currency and interest rate risk of the Groups net debt profile which were presented as part of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and borrowings are now presented within the classifications derivative financial assets and derivative financial liabilities.
The components of the Groups net debt profile are as follows: 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 Notes m m Non-current borrowings 26 537 788 1 Current borrowings and overdrafts 26 491 68 2 Debt-related derivative instruments 18 12 Current asset investments 1 Cash and cash equivalents 31 158 384 Net debt 858 471 1.
Current borrowings include 101 million 31 March 2005 not applicable in respect of securitised receivables.
Derivative financial instruments presented within assets and liabilities in the balance sheet of 80 million comprise net debt-related instruments of 12 million and net 2. non-debt-related instruments of 68 million.
Movements in the Groups net debt profile are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Balance at 31 March 471 420 Impact of IAS32 39 adoption note 41 58 Balance at 1 April 529 420 Decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents in the period 214 213 Cash inflow from increase in borrowings 78 258 Borrowings arising on acquisitions 6 Cash inflow from decrease in current asset investments 13 Increase in net debt resulting from cash flows 298 58 Exchange differences 31 7 Increase in net debt in the year 329 51 Balance at 31 March 858 471 33 Contingent liabilities 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Guarantees of loans and overdrafts of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and former subsidiaries 2 20 Trade guarantees 18 18 Guarantees given by the Group may not exceed 2 million 2005 22 million.
Other trade guarantees have been given in the normal course of business by the Group at both 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005.
These are excluded from the figures given above and are in respect of Revenue and Customs and the Rural Payments Agency for Agricultural Produce bonds, ECGD recourse agreements, letters of credit and tender and performance bonds.
The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
All such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis of current information and legal advice and after taking into account the Groups insurance arrangements.
Whilst there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at the balance sheet date will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.

The Cesalpinia Foods group, located in Italy, produces food ingredients, specialising in solutions for dairy products, soups, sauces and dressings.
The fair values currently established for the acquisition are provisional due to the proximity of the date of acquisition to the Groups reporting date.
The acquisition has contributed 12 million to sales and 1 million to operating profit in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition of Cesalpinia Foods had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have been 3,747 million and Group loss attributable to equity holders of the Company would have been 28 million.

The CCI group, based in the United States, produces food ingredients, specialising in dairy stabilisers, emulsifiers, beverage flavours and vitamin and mineral fortifications.
The acquisition has contributed 7 million to sales and nil million to operating profit in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition of CCI had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have been 3,757 million and Group loss attributable to equity holders of the Company would have been 27 million.

France Melasse During the year the Group increased its shareholding in France Melasse SA by 4 million.
Net assets of 2 million were acquired, giving rise to 2 million goodwill on consolidation.
Sucralose In April 2004, the Group completed the realignment of its Sucralose activities with McNeil Nutritionals McNeil, a Johnson & Johnson company, achieved through the separation of that business into its constituent Ingredient and Tabletop parts.
The Group acquired the Sucralose Ingredients business and manufacturing assets from McNeil for an initial consideration of 72 million.
In addition, there are contingent payments treated as deferred consideration, and other receipts treated as contingent assets note 14, that reflect continued participation in the success of each partys own ongoing Sucralose activities.

Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 115 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 40 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards As described in note 1, these Group financial statements are the first such statements prepared under IFRS.
The Groups transition date was 1 April 2004.
At this date, certain changes were made to the Groups accounting policies under UK GAAP in order to bring them in line with IFRS, resulting in a number of adjustments to equity to reflect the effects of retrospective application of those new policies.
In accordance with IFRS1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards the Group applied certain optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions to the principle of retrospective application of IFRS as follows: The Group has applied IFRS3 Business Combinations prospectively with effect from the transition date.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment were carried under UK GAAP at amounts based upon valuations.
The Group has applied the exemption which permits a first-time adopter to use a previous GAAP revaluation of an item of property, plant and equipment as deemed cost.
Consequently, there is no adjustment to the previous carrying value under UK GAAP.
As permitted by IFRS1 the Group has recognised all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the transition date for all employee benefit plans falling within the scope of IAS19 Employee Benefits.
This means that the net deficit on the Groups employee benefit plans is included within net assets at 1 April 2004.
The Group has applied the IFRS1 exemption from the requirement for retrospective application of IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates in respect of cumulative translation differences.
This means that the Group has elected not to classify any retained earnings arising prior to 1 April 2004 within cumulative translation differences, which are, therefore, deemed to be zero at the transition date.
The Group has applied the IFRS1 exemption from the requirement to restate its comparative information for the effects of adopting IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS4 Insurance Contracts.
The Group did not restate comparative information at 1 April 2004 or for the year to 31 March 2005 for these standards.
As permitted under IFRS1 and IFRS2 Share-based Payment, the Group has made no adjustment in either the income statement or balance sheet for share option grants that occurred prior to 7 November 2002.
Key changes in accounting policies The following notes highlight the main differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that had a material effect on the financial statements of the Group.
a Share-based payment Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised a charge in respect of employee share options based on the difference between the exercise price of the option and the market value of a Tate & Lyle share at the grant date.
Accordingly, only grants made under the Tate & Lyle 2003 Performance Share Plan attracted a charge under UK GAAP, based on their intrinsic value.
Under IFRS2 the Group recognises a charge reflecting the fair value of all employee share options granted since 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The UK GAAP charge for the year to 31 March 2005 totalled 2 million, reflecting expense for two years of option grants.
The impact of IFRS on profit before taxation for the year to 31 March 2005 is an additional charge of 2 million.
In the year to 31 March 2006, the IFRS charge increased to reflect expense covering three years of option grants.
Net assets increased by 3 million at 31 March 2005 reflecting the deferred taxation impact.
b Employee benefits Tate & Lyle operates a number of pension and post-employment healthcare schemes and has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for these schemes in accordance with SSAP24, which required that the expected cost be charged to the profit and loss account so as to accrue cost over the service lives of employees on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Under IAS19, the net surplus or deficit for each defined benefit scheme is calculated based on the present value of the discounted obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.
The Group has elected to adopt early the amendment to IAS19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004, which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be immediately charged or credited to equity through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The charge to the income statement under IAS19 comprises the current service cost, interest cost on scheme liabilities, expected return on scheme assets, past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments.
The impact on profit before taxation for the year to 31 March 2005 is a credit of 4 million.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by 117 million.
The impact on net assets reflects the reversal of prepayments and liabilities previously reported under UK GAAP and recognition of assets and liabilities measured in accordance with IFRS, including those of joint ventures, adjusted for the impact of deferred taxation.
116 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 40 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued c Intangible assets Research and development Under UK GAAP, the Group expensed all research and development costs as incurred.
Under IFRS, the Group is required to capitalise development costs where this expenditure meets the recognition criteria set out in IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Research costs continue to be expensed as incurred.
The capitalisation under IFRS of development costs expensed during the 2005 financial year under UK GAAP increased profit before taxation under IFRS by 1 million in the year to 31 March 2005.
The charge in the year to 31 March 2005 under IFRS for the amortisation of development costs capitalised in previous periods reduces profit before taxation by 1 million compared to UK GAAP.
Overall, the impact on profit before tax in the year to 31 March 2005 is nil million.
The impact on net assets under IFRS, reflecting the capitalisation of costs previously expensed as incurred under UK GAAP, after adjusting for the impact of deferred taxation, is an increase of 5 million at 31 March 2005.
Reclassification of capitalised software costs Under UK GAAP, software assets were included as part of property, plant and equipment, whereas under IFRS, unless they are integral to another asset, they are included as part of intangible assets.
In the balance sheet, a reclassification of 4 million from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets was reflected under IFRS at 31 March 2005.
There was no impact on either profit before taxation or total net assets under IFRS.
The treatment of goodwill under IFRS is discussed in the following note.
d Business combinations IFRS3 Business Combinations introduces significant changes to the accounting for acquisitions compared to UK GAAP.
The international standard requires recognition of all intangible assets that meet the IAS38 recognition criteria.
Any goodwill arising from business combinations is not amortised under IAS38, but is subject to impairment tests annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment.
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The requirement to cease amortising goodwill has the impact of increasing profit before taxation by 9 million in the year to 31 March 2005.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 increased by 9 million.
IFRS3 requires the Group to record inventories acquired in a business combination at an amount equivalent to the selling price of those inventories, less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the subsequent selling effort of the Group.
UK GAAP requires acquired inventories to be recorded at cost.
In the case of the Sucralose realignment, this leads to the Groups acquired inventory being valued at an amount 4 million higher under IFRS than under UK GAAP, resulting in an increased charge under IFRS during the year to 31 March 2005.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by 4 million.
e Accounting for joint ventures Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for joint ventures using the gross equity method, showing its share of joint venture turnover as part of total turnover, and its share of operating profit separately on the face of the profit and loss account.
Under IFRS, the Group has elected to account for joint ventures using proportionate consolidation, whereby its share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses is combined line by line with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
While this change does not materially alter total net assets, it has a significant impact on the classification of assets and liabilities within the Groups balance sheet.
Profit before taxation remains unchanged for all periods presented.
f Taxation There is no difference in accounting for current taxation between UK GAAP and IFRS.
In respect of deferred taxation, under UK GAAP, the Group recognised deferred taxation only on timing differences that arose from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they were recognised in the financial statements.
Under IAS12 Income Taxes, deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Under UK GAAP, the Group elected to discount deferred tax as permitted by FRS19.
Discounting of deferred tax is not permitted under IFRS.
The impact on the taxation charge for the year to 31 March 2005 is a debit of 2 million reflecting the reversal of the discounting effect recognised under UK GAAP.
An increase during the year under UK GAAP of the goodwill on the Sucralose realignment of 4 million relating to the unwinding of discounted deferred taxation on the realignment has been reversed.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by 33 million 1 April 2004 30 million, due to the reversal of the discounting effect recognised under UK GAAP as well as the recognition of deferred taxation in respect of the unremitted earnings of certain overseas investments.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 117 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 40 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued g Other Events after the balance sheet date Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised a provision for the dividend declared within its financial statements.
IFRS specifically states that dividends approved by the relevant authority after the reporting date do not meet the definition of a present obligation and should not therefore be recognised.
The impact of this is to increase net assets at 31 March 2005 by 65 million 1 April 2004 62 million.
Other adjustments Other adjustments, relating to sundry reclassifications and remeasurements, increase net assets by 6 million at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004 5 million.
These other adjustments contain certain minor amendments and balance sheet reclassifications compared to the unaudited appendix contained in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Cash flow The adoption of IFRS had no material impact on the consolidated cash flow statement, but led to the reclassification of certain items between categories.
Cash and cash equivalents presented in accordance with IFRS include cash and cash equivalents of joint ventures, accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method, of 30 million at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004 17 million and exclude certain current asset investments of 1 million at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004 14 million.
Financial instruments As noted above, the Group has applied the IFRS1 exemption from the requirement to restate its comparative information for the effects of adopting IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS4 Insurance Contracts.
Therefore, the Group adopted these standards with effect from 1 April 2005.

The effects of the changes in accounting policies required on the Groups balance sheet at 1 April 2005 are summarised below.
i Under UK GAAP the Group reported other non-current assets and current asset investments of 29 million and 1 million respectively.
These comprised: equity investments, now reclassified as available-for-sale financial assets: and loans and non-current receivables, now reclassified as trade and other receivables.
Available-for-sale financial assets are made up of non-current recievables previously carried at 15 million and current asset investments of 1 million.
A fair value adjustment resulted in an increase of 1 million, which also increases other reserves by the same amount.
Trade and other receivables are made up of other non-current assets carried at 10 million.
In addition to the reclassifications described above, a further 4 million previously reported as other non-current assets has been reclassified as derivative financial instruments.
ii Certain of the Groups derivative financial instruments were not carried at fair value under UK GAAP.
IFRS also requires separate presentation of derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet.
Reclassifications from other financial assets and liabilities and accrued interest balances have been made, along with re-measurement adjustments, as reflected in the restated consolidated balance sheet.
iii The Groups Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe business operates a securitisation programme under which it receives cash from selling trade receivables.
Under UK GAAP, the amounts received under this facility of 45 million were linked in presentation to the original amounts receivable.
Under IAS39, the amounts received are shown as borrowings.
Trade and other receivables are reduced for reclassification of derivative financial instruments of 14 million.
iv Cash and cash equivalents have been adjusted for the reclassification of currency swap contracts of 9 million.
v Cumulative preference shares of 2 million have been reclassified as non-current borrowings.
vi Other reserves are adjusted by 1 million for unrealised fair value adjustments arising on available-for-sale financial assets as explained in note i : a further reserve for deferred net gains on cash flow hedges of 11 million has been recorded in other reserves, net of attributable deferred taxation of 4 million.
vii Non-current and current trade and other payables are adjusted for reclassification of derivative financial instruments of 5 million and 35 million respectively, including 11 million relating to commodity trading contracts, as explained in note ii.
viii Non-current borrowings are adjusted for reclassification of derivative financial instruments of 13 million, as explained in note ii, and for cumulative preference shares of 2 million, as explained in note v. ix Current borrowings are adjusted for reclassification of derivative financial instruments of 21 million including 11 million relating to reclassified interest accruals, as explained in note ii, and for securitised receivables of 45 million, as explained in note iii.
x Retained earnings are increased by 1 million net as a result of re-measurement differences arising on financial instruments at 1 April 2005.
Under UK GAAP, trading instruments were marked-to-market using externally derived market prices.
Gains or losses were recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
For hedging instruments, the Group applied a form of hedge accounting which enabled changes in the market value of financial instruments to be matched in the profit and loss account with recognition of the underlying hedged exposure.
