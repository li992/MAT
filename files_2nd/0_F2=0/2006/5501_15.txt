62 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 7 Exceptional items As described in note 1, the Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its income statement.
This format enables enhanced disclosures relating to the Groups pre-exceptional performance and exceptional items.
The Group has determined the following pre-tax items to be exceptional: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 30 September 1 October 2006 2005 m m Costs in respect of conditional bid approaches 1.8 Restructuring costs 6.7 Increase in leasehold property provisions 5.4 Corporate reorganisation 1 7.5 Disposal of Vent Master businesses 0.6 Pre-tax exceptional items 1.8 29.0 Management note that exceptional items as defined or presented in these financial statements may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
2006 During the second half of 2006, the Group incurred costs of 1.8m, principally professional fees, considering and responding to the conditional approaches from The Manitowoc Company Inc and The Middleby Corporation.
2005 Restructuring During 2005 the Group completed a restructuring programme at a number of its European operations.
There were three elements to the programme: the cessation of manufacturing at the Groups Guyon factory in France: the consolidation of manufacturing for the Groups European Beverage business into the UK from Germany: and the reshaping of other UK businesses, including exiting from minor unprofitable product lines.
Associated costs included redundancy, fixed asset and inventory write-downs, vacant property costs and operating losses, arising from the decision to cease manufacturing.
Increase in leasehold property provisions During 2005 a review of the Groups surplus leasehold properties was carried out.
A number of these properties were leased several years ago on what are now unattractive terms.
The conclusion of the review was that whilst the Group was actively pursuing all options for these properties, an additional provision of 5.4m was required against these leases: this was charged through the 2005 income statement.
Corporate reorganisation As a result of the significant progress made over recent years and reflecting the Groups prospects a capital restructuring programme was completed during 2005.
This allowed the reinstatement of dividends and led to the termination of the Companys SEC reporting obligations.
The programme has simplified the Groups debt financing, reduced interest and compliance costs and freed up management time to focus on further business growth.
A total exceptional cost of 17.5m was charged during 2005 in respect of the Groups capital restructuring programme 3 including 2.1m of professional fees charged within operating profit, 12.6m of early settlement interest on the 10 8% Senior Subordinated Notes and 2.8m of non-cash write off of deferred finance costs.
The cash cost of the total transaction was 13.7m.
Disposal of Vent Master businesses In March 2005, the Group completed the sale of its Vent Master businesses to the Halton Group.
Vent Master was formerly included in the Groups Foodservice Equipment segment.
The Group received cash consideration of $6.0m 3.1m and incurred cash costs of 0.4m and other costs of 0.2m.
The net assets disposed of totalled 1.9m, including 0.1m of cash and cash equivalents.
As a result of the disposal, Group net assets increased by 0.6m.

Taxation relating to other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
ii For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2005, the tax relief on exceptional items includes a deferred tax benefit of 9.3m and a current tax charge of 0.1m.
The Groups tax charge for the period can be reconciled to the profit before tax in the income statement using the US Federal tax rate as follows: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 30 September 1 October 2006 2005 m m Income tax rate in region where majority of profits earned 35.0% 35.0% Profit loss on ordinary activities before taxation 62.2 15.1 Tax on profit loss at US Federal rate 21.8 5.3 Permanent differences 1.4 2.2 Additional deferred tax assets recognised 3.1 23.7 US State and local taxes effect 1.7 1.0 Foreign tax effect 0.2 0.9 Other 0.7 4.1 Effect of adjustments in respect of prior years 0.2 0.1 Tax expense benefit for the period 22.9 10.3 The reconciliation is performed to the US Federal tax rate as the majority of the Groups profits are earned in that jurisdiction.
In addition to the net income tax expense benefit recognised in profit or loss, a deferred tax expense of 1.2m 2005: tax benefit of 1.4m has been recognised in equity during the period.
65 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 11 Taxation continued b Analysis of deferred tax assets: Deferred tax assets recognised on the balance sheet are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Revenue losses 10.6 31.1 Warranties 10.4 10.2 US tax credits 6.5 5.8 Interest payments 3.9 3.7 Accrued compensation 3.6 2.8 Inventory and obsolescence 3.5 3.2 Pension and other deferred employee benefits 1.1 5.4 Other deferred tax assets 16.2 14.1 55.8 76.3 Other deferred tax liabilities 6.7 8.8 49.1 67.5 In certain cases, the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets due to the unpredictability of future taxable profits of the specific entities to which temporary differences, including revenue losses, relate.
Deferred tax assets not recognised on the balance sheet are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Revenue losses 24.9 24.5 Other 14.6 17.
9 Total potential deferred tax assets not recognised 39.5 42.4 In addition to the above, the Group has surplus UK Advance Corporation Tax carried forward of 12.6m 2005: 12.6m.
Based on projected taxable profits and other specific requirements, this asset is not recognised.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 352.3m 2005: 265.6m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group has the following revenue losses available for offset against future profits: 2006 2005 m m United Kingdom losses 90.4 95.5 United States losses 12.2 72.9 Other territories 12.4 4.4 115.0 172.8 The Groups losses in the US and other territories expire in stages through to 2010 if not used.
Losses in the UK do not expire.

Under current UK tax law, no withholding tax is required to be deducted from dividends paid by Enodis plc.
Subject to certain exceptions for traders in securities and insurance companies, a corporate shareholder resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes will generally not be subject to corporation tax on dividends received from Enodis plc.
Individual shareholders resident in the United Kingdom for taxation purposes are generally liable to income tax on the aggregate amount of any 1 dividend received from Enodis plc with a tax credit equal to 10% of the gross dividend or 9th of the cash dividend received.
The tax credit can be set against the individual shareholders total liability to income tax on the cash dividend.
Non-United Kingdom resident shareholders may be subject to tax on dividends received from Enodis plc under any law to which they are subject outside the United Kingdom.

The Groups adjusted earnings per share are based on profit loss before exceptional items see notes 1 and 7 and deferred taxation see note 11.

Accordingly, the adjusted opening cost for goodwill under IFRS was 182.3m.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs from which the Group is expected to benefit.
The carrying amount of goodwill for the Groups CGUs are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Scotsman Ice 57.4 60.6 Delfield 29.4 31.1 Frimont Castelmac 24.5 26.0 Kysor Panel Systems 24.3 25.6 Scotsman Beverage Systems 9.9 10.5 Jackson 13.0 13.7 Merrychef 12.6 12.6 Convotherm 6.2 4.7 Frau Group 2.6 Goodwill carrying value 179.9 184.8 The Group annually tests goodwill for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from its most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following seven years based on a growth rate of 3%, as well as recognising a terminal value based on a constant cash flow into perpetuity.
The growth rates applied beyond the most recent financial budgets do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the markets in which the Group operates.
The projected cash flows are discounted based on the Groups current estimated weighted average cost of capital of 10%.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time.
Based on current projections, management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.

The Group does not have any internally generated intangible assets.
i During the year, the Group reassessed the value of its purchased patent technology and concluded that, following advances in the Groups similar in-house technologies, that there will be insufficient sales of products using this particular technology to support its value.
Estimated future cash flows for the patent over the next five years have been discounted at a risk adjusted discount rate of 12% which resulted in a net present value less than the carrying value.
Therefore an impairment charge of 1.8m has been charged to the profit and loss account within the Foodservice North America segment.

As at 30 September 2006, adjusting to the Groups accounting policies, our share of Welbilt Thailand total assets was 1.8m 2005: 2.4m and total liabilities was 0.5m 2005: 1.1m.
For the 52 weeks ending on 30 September 2006, our share of Welbilt Thailand revenues was 2.7m 2005: 3.0m and operating profit was nil 2005: nil.
During the year, management reviewed the performance of Welbilt Thailand and concluded that the net present value of future trading performance discounted at a risk adjusted rate of 12% did not fully support the carrying value.
As a consequence, a charge of 0.5m 2005: nil has been charged to profit and loss and is reported in the Foodservice Europe Asia segment.
As the Group does not control Welbilt Thailand, the Group applies equity accounting for its investment interest.

These investments can only be used for this purpose.
Both the cash and the gilts are taken into account in the calculation of net debt, as are the corresponding liabilities arising under the Notes.
The Trustee has been given irrevocable instructions to call the Notes in April 2007 and therefore the defeasance trust assets are disclosed as current assets.
iii On transition to IAS39, the Group has designated its investments in Rabbi Trusts to be held at fair value through profit and loss.
Fair value is measured at the market price as at the balance sheet date.
The fair value on transition to IAS39 was 4.5m, compared to a carrying value under UK GAAP of 4.2m.
iv Other loans and receivables relate to a loan repayable by 2021 which accrues interest at 6.5%.
v During the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2006, the Group disposed of its interest in C. Czarnikow Limited for 1.4m, recognising a gain on sale of 0.4m in Corporate costs.

For the 52 weeks ending 30 September 2006, the Groups average credit period on sales of goods and services debtor days was 45 days 2005: 45 days.
The standard credit terms for the Groups trade receivables are typically 30 days.
In certain instances longer periods may be negotiated up to 180 days.
From time to time, the Group charges interest on balances that are outstanding beyond its standard credit terms at interest rates up to 10%.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from trade receivables of 3.7m 2005: 3.5m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience and known exposures.

The Facility is unsecured and has US$225m maturing in September 2009 with the remaining US$175m maturing in October 2010.
Drawings under the Facility bear interest at between 0.75% and 1.50% above LIBOR as determined by reference to certain agreed financial ratios.
The premium that the Group pays above LIBOR is determined under the Facility on a quarterly basis.
Current drawings bear interest at LIBOR 0.85%.
72 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 21 Total borrowings continued The Facility is a multi-currency facility which can be used for general corporate purposes and for issuing letters of credit.
The Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants including, among other things, covenants to maintain ratios of EBITDA to total interest cost and maximum ratios of net debt to EBITDA.
The Facility also includes covenants relating to the making of acquisitions, disposals, certain restricted payments, mergers and liens.
The Facility contains customary events of default including without limitation, failure to make payments under the Facility, breach of financial or general covenants, misrepresentations, cross-default in respect of other indebtedness in excess of 5m, insolvency, bankruptcy and any material adverse change as defined in the agreement.
The Group also has letters of credit drawn under the Facility totalling 40.5m 2005: 41.8m.
After taking account of these letters of credit and existing drawings, the Group had 91.9m 2005: 62.5m of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility.
3 The Groups borrowings under the Senior Subordinated Notes the Notes, which pay interest at 10 8%, were subject to legal defeasance during 2005.
On 27 July 2005 the Group irrevocably transferred the remaining 19.9m current value 20.6m of liabilities under the Notes into a trust administered by the Bank of New York the Trustee together with UK Government Gilts and cash sufficient to meet all remaining future liabilities arising on the Notes including an early redemption fee payable in April 2007.
In certain circumstances, it is possible for the assets and liabilities of the trust to be returned to Enodis plc.
These circumstances, which are considered to be remote, are: that a Court, Government or similar authority issues an order preventing the Trustee from applying the funds to settlement of the debt obligations: circumstances in which the transfer is not effective due to insufficient funds being initially deposited: and if any amounts remain unclaimed by April 2009.
Accordingly, the Notes and associated gilts and related cash are not derecognised from the Groups balance sheets.
The Groups other loans 8.2m consist primarily of industrial revenue bonds issued from various governments or local bodies.
These bonds are either at fixed rates of interest or at rates of interest set periodically by reference to market rates and are secured over certain properties owned by the Group.
The bonds incurred rates of interest of between 0.0% and 8.7% during the period.
22 Financial instruments a Impact of adopting IAS32 and IAS39: The main adjustments for the Group from adopting IAS32 and IAS39, effective from 2 October 2005, relate to recognising borrowings at amortised cost previously face value, cross currency swaps at fair value previously contracted value and recognising certain derivative instruments that were previously off balance sheet, for example certain foreign exchange hedges and commodity contracts for difference.
The effect on the Groups shareholders funds and net debt from adopting IAS32 and IAS39 on 2 October 2005 was: m Shareholders funds increase decrease Decrease in fair value of net investment hedges cross currency swaps 1.6 Increase in fair value of pension asset Rabbi Trusts 0.3 Decrease in other financial liabilities 0.2 Decrease in deferred tax assets 0.1 1.2 Net debt increase decrease Decrease in fair value of net investment hedges cross currency swaps 1.6 Increase in carrying value of borrowings 0.1 1.7 A restated opening balance sheet for 2 October 2005 is presented in note 35.
73 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 22 Financial instruments continued b Group financial and treasury risk management policies The Group is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group monitors and manages these risks as an integral part of the Groups overall risk management programme, which recognises the unpredictability of the markets in which it operates and seeks to reduce their potentially adverse effects on the Groups results, where economically and commercially possible.
i Foreign exchange risk management: The Group sells its products in over 100 countries and has manufacturing operations in eight countries.
As a result, the Group faces transactional currency exposure when the Groups operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency.
Foreign exchange transaction exposures are identified and generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries within the Groups policies and guidelines.
The central treasury function enters into foreign exchange hedging transactions on behalf of subsidiaries where this is beneficial to the Group.
The Group has significant capital employed in overseas operations.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group has a policy to hedge this risk, where appropriate, to limit the effect of foreign exchange rate movements.
Accordingly the Group has loans in the same currencies as the capital employed in the Groups main overseas operations.
From time to time, the Group uses cross currency swap instruments to also convert the currency of the Groups borrowings to such functional currencies.
ii Commodity risk management: The Group is subject to market risk in respect of commodities mainly base metals since the Groups ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which it operates.
In some instances the Group may not be able to pass increased costs onto its customers.
The Group enters into arrangements to facilitate an adequate supply of materials, as well as to lock into predeterminable pricing levels.
These supply contracts are typically for a period of 12 months to 36 months.
Some of the Groups purchase contracts fix the price of items bought, while other contracts allow for price variations.
Certain of the Groups steel supply contracts allow for variations based on the price of certain metals such as nickel, copper and aluminium.
To reduce exposures to fluctuations in the price of these metals the Group may fix the price with its suppliers, or in some instances enter into external contracts for difference that have the effect of fixing the overall price paid.
The Groups policy is to apply hedge accounting see below to these relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39, practical to do so and its application reduces earnings volatility.
However, in certain instances transactions that may be effective hedges in economic terms may not always qualify for hedge accounting under IAS39.
Consequently, in the case of the Groups nickel hedges, the fair value of any outstanding contracts for difference are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group applies hedge accounting to its copper and aluminium contracts for difference.
iii Interest rate risk management: The Group finances its operation through a mix of retained profits and borrowings.
To reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the Groups borrowings, the Groups policy is to have fixed rate debt equal to at least 50% of its borrowings.
Accordingly, the Group may contract with major financial institutions for interest rate swap agreements, where the Group agrees to exchange the difference between a fixed interest rate and a variable interest rate, as applied to a notional principal amount.
iv Liquidity risk management: The Groups policy is to hold cash and cash equivalents and maintain undrawn credit facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations as well as any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
v Credit risk management: The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial assets, but it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given the Groups policy of selecting only counterparties with high credit ratings.
The exposure to credit loss of liquid assets is equivalent to the carrying value on the balance sheet.
The maximum credit exposure of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the Groups trade and other receivables are limited to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
The Group therefore believes that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of its normal provision for doubtful receivables.
In the normal course of business, the Group has entered into arrangements in respect of performance bonds, letters of credit and other guarantee arrangements.
The Group treats these arrangements as executory contracts until such time as the Group is required to perform under the prescribed arrangements, however these arrangements still subject the Group to potential credit risk.
Additionally, the Group has restrictions in respect of repatriating retained earnings from its operations in China, where approvals from local regulatory agencies are required.
The current amount of retained earnings subject to such approvals is currently not material.
The maximum credit risk at 30 September 2006 on recognised financial assets is 193.1m 2005: 180.2m.
74 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 22 Financial instruments continued c Hedge accounting: As described above, the Groups risk management policies include hedging foreign exchange risks, interest rate risks and commodity price risk using a range of hedging instruments.
Where possible the Group applies hedge accounting, as summarised below: i Net investment hedges: From time to time the Group uses cross currency swap instruments to align borrowings to the underlying net investment held in foreign currencies as well as same currency loans.
To the extent that these hedges are effective, changes in the fair value of these derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges are included within equity reserves until earnings are affected by the hedged item.
Ineffective portions of such hedges are recognised immediately in profit and loss.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, or when it is no longer probable that the investments will remain.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in current period earnings.
Gains and losses related to discontinued hedges that were previously included in equity reserves will remain in equity reserves until the disposal of the underlying investment.
As at 30 September 2006 the Group had no cross currency swap instruments outstanding.
ii Cash flow hedges: The Groups interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and certain commodity contracts for difference are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Upon the designation of these derivatives as cash flow hedges, any effective gains and losses arising are deferred in equity reserves.
Any ineffective portions are recognised in profit and loss immediately.
The effective gains and losses deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit and loss.
The following table summarises the fair value of the Groups outstanding derivatives.
As part of the adoption of IAS39 on 2 October 2006, these have been designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges: Financial asset liability 2006 m Interest rate swaps 0.4 Commodity contracts for difference 0.1 0.5 The Groups commodity contracts for difference have maturity dates of less than one year, while the Groups interest rate swaps mature at various dates out to November 2007.
The Group had short-term foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2006 which had a fair value of 0.1m and were recognised in profit and loss.
d Financial instrument profiles and summary of interest rates: The Groups financial assets are either available on demand or have maturity dates due within one year except for the Groups investments in Rabbi Trusts, which are held to meet the underlying pension obligations, the bulk of which are non-current in nature.
Interest rate swaps, as detailed in note 22c i and ii above are included in the fair value.
i Maturity profile: The maturity profile based on the contractual lives of the Groups financial liabilities, are as follows: 2006 2005 Borrowings Other Total Borrowings Other Total m m m m m m Within less than one year, or on demand 3.0 23.1 26.1 2.3 1.2 3.5 More than one year but not more than two years 0.5 0.5 15.4 15.4 More than two years but not more than three years 0.3 0.3 More than three years but not more than four years 0.1 0.1 22.9 2.6 25.5 More than four years but not more than five years 81.7 0.2 81.9 More than five years 5.9 5.9 98.9 7.0 105.9 Gross financial liabilities 84.7 30.1 114.8 124.1 26.2 150.3 In the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities Other includes obligations under finance leases, Senior Subordinated Notes and other loans see note 21.

Where interest rate swaps are taken out, the payment dates of such swaps are matched to the interest payment dates of the Groups revolving credit facility.
The Groups interest rate swaps are also denominated in the same currency as the related borrowings.
As at 30 September 2006, the Group had gross borrowings of 114.8m: 73.1m of these borrowings were fixed principally through interest rate swaps 48.2m, which mature by November 2007 and Senior Subordinated Notes 20.6m, which are due for redemption in April 2007.
The remaining 4.3m relates to other minor fixed rate borrowings ie other bonds.
In total fixed borrowings represented 64% of the Groups total borrowings, 36% 41.7m remains floating or non-interest bearing.
A hypothetical 100-basis point increase in the interest rates associated with the Groups floating rate borrowings during 2006 would have increased the Groups interest expense by approximately 0.6m.
The floating rate cash and cash equivalents comprise certain bank accounts that earn interest.
The non-interest bearing cash and cash equivalents relate to uncleared receipts and cash in current accounts.
The non-interest bearing investments mainly comprise Rabbi Trust investments that are held in unit trusts.

The fair value of the Senior Subordinated Notes has been calculated as the present value of the future cash flows, using a UK Gilt discount rate of 4.5%.
The fair value of the Defeasance trust investments is the mid-price at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and current borrowings approximates the carrying amount because of the short-term maturity of these investments.
The fair value of the non-current borrowings approximates the carrying value due to the debt being subject to floating rates or short-term fixed rates.
77 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 23 Acquisitions On 31 January 2006, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of the Frau Group Frau for a net total consideration of 110.0m 6.9m to be satisfied in cash, subject only to adjustment for final net working capital and certain performance criteria.
Frau, based in Spain, consists of a distribution business concentrating on ice machines and combi-ovens and also a service and installation business trading under the name of Teuros.
This transaction has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

The amount of revenue and profit before tax since the acquisition date that is included in the Groups results for the 52 weeks to 30 September 2006 was 8.1m and 0.1m respectively.
If the acquisition of Frau had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the Groups revenues and profit attributable to equity holders would have been 771.7m and 39.2m respectively.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the distribution network and access to new customers arising from the future distribution of the Groups products into the Spanish market.

The ESOP trust, which was established in 1994, purchased shares in Enodis plc to meet some of the future obligations under employee option schemes.
Shares are distributed to specified employees upon their exercise of certain options and payment by them of the exercise price.
The Group finances the ESOP trust by way of an interest free loan of 2.1m.
The ESOP trust has waived the right to receive dividends on all shares held.
Costs are borne by Enodis plc and are written off in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency translation reserve the reserve represents the currency realignment that arises on the translation of interests in the opening net assets of overseas subsidiary entities and associated undertakings, long-term foreign currency borrowings used to finance overseas investments, and on the translation of the income statement for the period to the closing foreign exchange rate.
Hedging reserve effective from 2 October 2005, the Group applies hedge accounting, as defined in IAS39 see note 22.
Gains or losses on certain derivative instruments are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Gains and losses are released to profit and loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts earnings.
Other reserves include the Groups reserve for share options where a charge for the option has been recognised but the option has yet to be exercised.
27 Share options The Group has three share option schemes in place for certain employees, using new shares of Enodis plc.
The individual schemes which comprise the Groups long-term incentive programmes have outstanding grants as follows: the Sharesave Scheme 1992, the Executive Share Scheme 1995 and the Executive Share Scheme 2001.
Under the executive option scheme rules, options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of Enodis plcs shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is three years.
Awards under the Executive Share Scheme 1995 are subject to earnings per share thresholds being met.
Awards under the Executive Share Scheme 2001 are subject to prescribed Total Shareholder Return TSR thresholds being met see the Directors remuneration report on page 40 for further information on TSR.
Additionally under that scheme, no options may be exercised unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance.
If options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
In most cases, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The Group recognised a total charge of 1.6m 2005: 1.8m relating to equity settled share options during the year.

Following the Groups transition to IFRS on 3 October 2004, all grants of share options subsequent to 7 November 2002 are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
During the current financial year, options were granted on 3 January and 28 September 2006, with a fair value per option of 0.28 and 0.38 respectively.
During the previous financial year options were granted on 25 November 2004 and 17 February 2005.
The fair values of the options granted on those dates were 0.28 and 0.32 respectively.
These fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model, as well as incorporating a discount for the schemes market based performance conditions of approximately 30%.
A discussion of the Groups market based performance conditions is included in the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the options vesting period of three years.
Inputs into the Black-Scholes pricing model were as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price 1.31 1.03 Weighted average exercise price 1.31 1.03 Weighted average expected volatility 27.0% 27.7% Expected life years 6.5 6.5 Risk free interest rate 4.2% 4.9% Expected dividend yield 1.6% Discount for effects of market based performance conditions 30% 30% Expected volatility has been determined by reference to the historic volatility of Enodis plcs share price over dates ranging from one year to three years.
The periods of historical volatility that are used are considered as suitable estimates for the future volatility over the estimated life of the option.
In determining the expected life of the share options management gave consideration to the three year vesting period and the contractual life of ten years from the date of grant.
The mid-point of this range was used, which management believes accommodates the effects of the potential for certain option holders to exercise their options at an earlier date.
Management assesses at the end of each reporting period its estimates in relation to forfeitures.
Over recent years the Groups forfeiture rate has been low.
The Group also has an obligation to pay a cash amount of 0.4m to Mr D S McCulloch should he exercise a grant of options made in August 2003.
The Group has recognised a liability for this amount as at 30 September 2006.
28 Pension and other post-retirement obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution type.
The Groups key pension arrangements include: a A number of the Groups UK employees are members of a defined benefit arrangement with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
b A number of the Groups US employees participate in a 401 k plan, which is a defined contribution arrangement.
Additionally, the Group has two post retirement medical plans in the US.
c Some of the Groups US employees also participate in a defined benefit arrangement with frozen accrued benefits.
In this arrangement, benefits under defined benefit plans for hourly paid employees are based on a fixed multiple of the accrued length of service and for salaried employees are based on a percentage of earnings during the period of their employment.
d The Group has a number of other defined benefit arrangements in North America, the UK and continental Europe.
81 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Pension and other post-retirement obligations continued The Group also has a defined contribution and a defined benefit plan where the assets are held under Rabbi Trusts.
The Group accounts for pensions and other post-retirement obligations under IAS19 R Employee Benefits.
The Groups pension costs, balance sheet positions and additional pension related note disclosures have been determined by independent, qualified actuaries.
The balance sheet position for the Groups pension and post retirement medical obligations is summarised below: As at As at 30 September 1 October 2006 2005 m m Defined benefit schemes fair value of plan assets 112.9 108.9 Defined benefit schemes fair value of plan liabilities 122.9 124.1 10.0 15.2 Rabbi Trust defined contribution scheme liabilities 2.4 2.4 12.4 17.6 Disclosed as: Pension and other post-retirement assets 9.3 5.3 Pension and other post-retirement liabilities 21.7 22.9 12.4 17.6 The benefits associated with the Groups defined benefit plans are generally based on a formula recognising length of service and final average earnings.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 30 September 1 October 2006 2005 % % Discount rate 4.45.8 4.06.0 Expected rate of increase in salaries 4.04.3 4.35.0 Expected rate of increase in pension payments where appropriate 2.8 2.8 Expected rate of increase in pensions in deferment where appropriate 2.8 2.8 Medical cost inflation 5.011.0 5.012.0 Price inflation 2.02.8 2.02.8 The figures for the Groups UK Scheme have been based on a full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2004.
For the Groups pension and other post retirement obligations in the US, the figures have been based on full actuarial valuations as at 1 January 2006.
All valuations are updated for IAS19 purposes at each year end.
The assets in the Groups defined benefit Schemes and the expected rates of return were: Long term Long term rate of return rate of return expected at Value at expected at Value at 30 September 30 September 1 October 1 October 2006 2006 2005 2005 % p. a m % p. a m Equities 7.37.8 37.5 7.07.8 56.5 Bonds 4.55.0 74.3 4.34.5 51.7 Other 3.04.5 1.1 2.84.3 0.7 Total 112.9 108.9 The Group defined benefit schemes assets do not include any of the Groups own shares, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by the Group.

Enodis, et al.
In the case, the bankruptcy trustee sought to hold Enodis Corporation liable as the alter ego of its former subsidiary Consolidated Industries Corporation Consolidated, for the debts and other liabilities of Consolidated.
Enodis Corporation sold Consolidated to an unrelated party in 1998.
Shortly after the sale, Consolidated commenced bankruptcy proceedings.
In addition to the alter ego claim, the trustee asserted a variety of bankruptcy and equitable claims seeking to recover up to $37m paid by Consolidated to Enodis Group between 1988 and 1998.
As previously discussed in our 2004 Annual Report, on 7 January 2003, the United States District Court entered a partial summary judgement for $8.6m against Enodis Corporation in relation to the complaint by the trustee that the purchase price paid to Enodis for the share capital of Consolidated was a fraudulent transfer under US bankruptcy law.
On 28 July 2004, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion dismissing all claims against all defendants other than Enodis Corporation, and held that the trustee was not entitled to assert the alter ego claims against Enodis Corporation.
However, the Court also held that the trustee was entitled to recover $30m paid by Consolidated, plus prejudgement interest, for a total of approximately $43m.
This judgement is in addition to the summary judgement issued by the United States District Court in 2003.
Enodis Corporation appealed the adverse portion of the decision of the Bankruptcy Court and planned to appeal the previous adverse decision of the District Court when it was appropriate to do so.
On 31 October 2006 the District Court upheld the rulings of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the dismissal of all claims against the defendants other than Enodis, the denial of the trustees alter ego claim against Enodis and the judgement against Enodis.
Enodis will now appeal the judgements to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit as previously planned.
The Directors, having reconfirmed advice from external legal counsel after the District Court issued its decision, still believe the adverse portions of the decisions of the District Court to be in error, and further believe it is probable that Enodis appeals will be successful.
The Group is also involved in other Consolidated lawsuits alleging total damage claims of $6.2m.
These claims are currently pending and we continue to defend them vigorously.
Other parties in cases pending against Consolidated have threatened to sue Enodis Corporation as Consolidateds alter ego.
Currently, however, no party other than the trustee is actively pursuing this theory against Enodis Corporation.

86 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 34 IFRS to UK GAAP reconciliation This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The Groups comparative information presented for 2005 was initially reported under UK GAAP and has been restated.
Details of this restatement, and the Groups IFRS accounting policies are set out in the Groups IFRS Restatement of Financial Information for 2005 announced on 26 January 2006 and available on the Groups website www.
Other than the adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 see note 22, there have been no new material variations between IFRS and UK GAAP applicable to the Group.
The following exemptions were applied by the Group on its transition to IFRS, in accordance with IFRS1.
IFRS1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirement to apply certain Standards retrospectively.
The Group has taken the following exemptions: Comparative information on financial instruments is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and the Group has adopted IAS32 and IAS39 from 2 October 2005.
IFRS3 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries or of interests in the joint venture that occurred before 3 October 2004.
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to pension and other post-retirement benefits as at 3 October 2004.
Subsequently, the Group recognises actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they arise.
These gains and losses are recognised in equity reserves, through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, in accordance with the amendment to IAS19 Employee Benefits issued on 16 December 2004.
Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at 3 October 2004.
IFRS2 Share-based Payment has not been applied to any share options that were granted on or before 7 November 2002.
The significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that impact the Group are described below: Goodwill amortisation and impairment: Under UK GAAP, the policy followed prior to the adoption of FRS10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets FRS10 which was effective for accounting periods ended on or after 23 December 1998 and was adopted on a prospective basis was to write off goodwill against equity reserves in the year of acquisition.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the amount of related goodwill previously charged to equity reserves.
FRS10 requires goodwill to be capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Under UK GAAP, the Group adopted a 20 year estimated useful life with respect to goodwill amortisation.
Under IFRS, in accordance with available transitional exemptions, goodwill arising on previously acquired businesses subsequent to 23 December 1998 has been capitalised.
In the case of acquisitions that arose up to or before 23 December 1998, goodwill was written off directly to equity reserves.
Prior to the Groups transition to IFRS on 3 October 2004, goodwill previously written off to equity reserves was charged to the income statement when the related business was sold.
Following the Groups transition to IFRS, goodwill remaining in equity reserves is no longer charged to the income statement, but is held within the Groups retained earnings when the related business is sold.
Additionally, goodwill capitalised on the Groups IFRS balance sheet is now deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is not subject to an annual amortisation charge.
Instead, capitalised goodwill balances are now reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
87 Enodis plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 34 IFRS to UK GAAP reconciliation continued Pensions and other post employment benefits: Under UK GAAP, pension and other post employment benefit obligations were accounted for in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP24.
Under SSAP24, pension and other post employment benefit costs were charged to the income statement based on a Projected Unit Funding or Attained Age basis, so as to spread pension and other post employment benefit costs, as well as any related plan surpluses or deficits, at a substantially level percentage of payroll costs over the participating employees estimated service lives.
Under IFRS, the Group accounts for pension and other post retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS19R Employee Benefits as amended IAS19.
IAS19 requires the net deficit of the Groups defined benefit and other post employment benefit obligations to be brought onto the Groups balance sheet.
Under IAS19, the costs of providing pensions and other post employment benefits are calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and are spread over the participating employees estimated service lives.
The Groups IFRS pension and other post employment benefit obligations are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at rates reflecting the yields of high quality corporate bonds.
Plan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses in the period that they arise.
Accordingly, differences relating to the accounting for pension and other post employment benefit obligations between UK GAAP and IFRS arise from the requirement to use different methods and assumptions for valuing plan assets and a different method of charging plan surpluses or deficits.
Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Share options: The Group has a number of share-based incentive option arrangements.
Under UK GAAP, where options are granted at the market price on the date of grant, an accounting entry arises when share options are exercised.
This entry results in equity shareholders funds increasing by the product of the number of options exercised multiplied by the original option price.
Under IFRS, all grants of share options subsequent to 7 November 2002 are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model, incorporating an adjustment for related market based performance conditions.
The fair value is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the options vesting period.
Deferred taxation: The basis for recognising deferred tax items is different under UK GAAP and IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided on timing differences between the accounting and taxable profit an income statement approach.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on all temporary differences between book carrying values and the respective tax base of assets and liabilities a balance sheet approach.
This difference in approach in determining taxable differences has not given rise to a significant GAAP adjustment for the Group on transitioning to IFRS.
The main adjustments relating to deferred taxation have arisen due to the tax effect of other IFRS adjustments made.
Gain loss on sale of businesses: As discussed above, goodwill previously written off to equity reserves prior to the adoption of FRS10 is included in determining the gain or loss on sale of a business under UK GAAP.
Following the Groups transition to IFRS, goodwill remaining in equity reserves is not charged to profit loss on disposal.
Proposed dividends: Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends are recognised as a liability in the period to which they relate.
Under IFRS, dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved.
