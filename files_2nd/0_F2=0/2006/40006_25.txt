SEGRO Notes to the financial statements Annual Report 2006 73.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation and consolidation Basis of preparation Slough Estates plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in England.
These financial statements are presented in sterling since that is the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated.
The consolidated and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC Interpretations, and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
In addition, the Group has also followed best practice recommendations issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 230 of the Companies Act not to present a separate income statement for the parent company.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The key estimates and assumptions relate to the property valuations applied by the Group's property valuers, the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Group's retirement pension benefit obligations, and in the determination of the valuation of available-for-sale investments.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements, prepared up to 31 December 2006, comprise the financial statements of Slough Estates plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures and associates.
The Company holds investments in these undertakings at cost.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company.
They are consolidated under the acquisition method from the date of control, and fide-recognised when control ceases.
Their financial statements are adjusted to align to Group accounting policies, and intra-group balances and unrealised results on intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
An associate is an entity which the Group can significantly influence but not control.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity, or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Group's share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Presentation of Group income statement The Group income statement has been presented by analysing the results into three columns: Adjusted Income and Expense, Adjustments and IFRS Income and Expense.
In addition, the results of the property joint ventures and associates have been included immediately after net property rental income and profit on sale of trading properties.
The adjustments column represents items of income and expense and related taxation and minority interest, that have been recommended by the Best Practices Committee of EPRA as requiring adjustment in arriving at the EPRA adjusted measure of earnings per share, together with items classified as exceptional items.
Exceptional items are significant items, separately disclosed for their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of performance, and primarily consist of significant premiums received on the early surrender of leases, significant gains on the sale of assets and the UK Real Estate Investment Trust REIT conversion charge.
Details of amounts included within the adjustments column are set out in Note 13.
The results of the property joint ventures and associates have been brought further up the Group income statement from the normal position set out in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, so as to reflect the property income of the Group together within the Group income statements.
The presentation, as set out above, has been adopted so as to explain more clearly the different aspects of the Groups financial performance.
Goodwill Goodwill arises on acquiring a business undertaking, when the fair value of the acquisition cost exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired.
It is carried in the balance sheet at cost, but reviewed for impairment annually, with any impairment immediately recorded in the income statement.
If the acquisition cost is lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired, this excess is booked in the Group income statement in the year of acquisition.

Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency and exchange Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Group income statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in the revenue reserve, and recognised in the Group income statement when the operation is sold.
Property portfolio Investment property These are freehold and leasehold properties held to earn rental income or gain capital appreciation.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
The properties are first measured at cost including transaction costs, and then revalued to fair value at each reporting date by professional valuers.
Additions include costs of a capital nature, capitalised interest if under development, and costs relating to managing developments e. g. internal staff costs.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the Group income statement, and then reclassified from distributable revenue reserves into undistributable revaluation reserves until realisation on the sale of the property.
As the Group uses the fair value model as per IAS 40, no depreciation is provided.
Existing investment properties being redeveloped to earn future rental income continue to be treated as investment properties.
Those being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties but not classified as such before, are treated as development properties.
When the Group redevelops an investment property with a view to sell, it is revalued at fair value and transferred to trading properties, with any gain or loss taken to the Group income statement.
The gain or loss arising on the sale of a property is the difference between sales proceeds and the brought forward carrying amount plus additions in the period, and is recognised in the Group income statement.
Development properties and owner occupied properties These comprise properties acquired for development, as well as completed properties occupied by Group entities, and are initially measured at cost including interest.
Only owner-occupied properties are depreciated.
Properties are fair-valued on the same basis as investment properties with revaluation movements being booked in the revaluation reserve through the Statement of recognised income and expense.
However, where a fall reduces the value to below cost, the deficit is taken to the Group income statement.
Subsequent revaluation gains are taken to the Group income statement, but only to the extent of cumulative net deficits charged to the Group income statement.
On completion, development properties are reclassified at fair value to investment properties.
If sold, a gain or loss is recognised in the Group income statement equal to the difference between sales proceeds, and the carrying amount at the beginning of the period plus additions in the period.
Any revaluation reserve surplus is transferred to revenue reserves.
Owner-occupied properties are depreciated over their estimated useful lives usually 30 years.
Trading properties These are properties developed and held for sale, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and any capitalised interest.
For pre-sold developments, profits are recognised by reference to work completed using the percentage of completion method.
The amount due from customers for contract work is booked as a receivable, comprising costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses.
If the Group reclassifies properties from trading to investment, they are transferred at fair value, with the resulting fair value gain taken to the Group income statement.
Property purchases and sales Property purchases and sales are recognised on the date of unconditional exchange, or, where exchange is conditional, on the date that the conditions have been satisfied.
SEGRO Notes to the financial statements Annual Report 2006 75.
Significant accounting policies continued Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee, are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Group company as borrowing lessee Under finance leases, the minimum lease obligation, or if lower, the assets fair value, is capitalised at the commencement of the lease.
The rental obligation is recorded as a borrowing at a similar amount.
Each lease payment is allocated between liability repayment and finance charges in a way so as to achieve a constant effective interest rate on the balance outstanding.
Under operating leases, the asset does not appear in the Groups balance sheet, and lease payments are charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group company as lessor Under finance leases, the asset leased out is not shown in the Groups balance sheet, but the present value of the minimum lease payments is booked as a receivable.
Lease income is recognised over the lease term using the net investment method before tax, which reflects a constant effective interest rate on the outstanding balance.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Impairment The Groups assets, excluding investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to assess impairment.
Where indication of impairment exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated, and if found to be lower than its carrying value, it is written down to the recoverable amount.
The impairment loss is taken to the Group income statement.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net selling price and its value-in-use i. e. the net present value of its future cash flows, discounted at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the borrowing costs and risks for the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed if estimates for the recoverable amount change, but only to the extent that its carrying amount after reversal does not exceed the net asset value that would arise had there been no impairment loss.
Revenue Revenue includes rent, income from service charges, proceeds from the sale of trading properties and sales of electricity, water and steam, and in 2005 revenue from gas assets in Australia.
Rental income This includes net income from managed operations.
Rentals from properties let as operating leases are recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are amortised on a straight line basis.
For properties let as finance leases, minimum lease receipts are apportioned between finance income and principal repayment, but receipts that were not fixed at lease inception e. g. rent review rises, are booked as income when earned.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the relevant services provided at the reporting date.
Proceeds from sale of trading properties A trading property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer on the date of unconditional exchange, or, for conditional exchanges, when all the conditions have been satisfied.
Sales of electricity, water and steam and sales from gas assets Sales of utility services are recognised when these services are delivered to the customer.
Borrowings, borrowing costs and derivatives Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the Group income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
com Notes to the financial statements 76.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives especially interest rate swaps in managing interest rate risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the Group income statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged.
None of the Groups interest rate derivatives qualify as a hedge.
However, there are USD and Euro forward currency sales that have been elected as effective net investment hedges.
Other assets, liabilities and exceptional items Available-for-sale AFS investments These are non-derivative financial assets, that are not held for trading, but are designated as available for sale.
They primarily include investments in Charterhouse USA, Candover and certain warrants in USA corporate tenants.
The investments are held at fair value, with gains and losses taken to equity, and then recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement, calculated as the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in income.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement are not reversed through income.
Plant and equipment These include power station assets, oil and gas plant & equipment, vehicles, group office improvements and furniture and fixtures.
They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost, since cost is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits held with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts.
Provisions A provision is recognised where there is an obligation from past events requiring settlement by an outflow of economic benefits.
Where material, expected outflows are discounted at rates reflecting prevailing interest rates and risks.
A provision for an onerous contract is recognised where the unavoidable cost of meeting contractual obligations exceeds its benefits.
Dilapidations are provided for if an obligation exists at the reporting date which can be reliably estimated.
Employee benefits Pensions Defined benefit schemes The schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the balance sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the income statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through equity in the Statement of recognised income and expense.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future.
Pensions Defined contribution schemes Contributions to such schemes are expensed as incurred.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value at grant date.
They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that performance will not be met.
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes model.
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans or other share based payment arrangements are treated as treasury shares and deducted from equity, and no profit or loss is recognised on their sale, issue or cancellation.
SEGRO Notes to the financial statements Annual Report 2006 77.
Significant accounting policies continued Tax Current tax The current tax charge is based on results for the year, adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowable.
It is calculated using rates that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The conversion charge applicable to the Group's UK properties covered by the REIT regime has been provided as current tax as the Group was committed to this liability at 31 December 2006.
Deferred tax This is the tax expected to be paid or recovered on differences between the reported value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
The Group uses the balance sheet liability method, under which tax liabilities are usually recognised for all taxable temporary differences, but tax assets are recognised only to the extent taxable profits are expected to be available against which to utilise temporary differences.
The carrying amount of tax assets is reviewed each reporting date and reduced if full recoverability is not expected.
Tax is calculated at rates expected to apply in the period the liability settles or the asset is realised, and is booked to the income statement.
Where it relates to items accounted for in equity, however, the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when they are levied by the same tax authority and the Group is entitled to settle net.
Indexation relief on land is allowed as a reduction of the deferred tax liability, but not on the buildings, unless the properties are in the process of being sold.
From 1 January 2007, no deferred tax is recognised on UK properties covered by the REIT regime.
All deferred tax liabilities relating to the properties in the REIT have been released to the income statement on 31 December 2006.

As a result, no UK corporation tax should be due on future income or capital gains in respect of investment properties within the REIT.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, no net UK tax is expected to be payable.

Included in the above analysis are unamortised borrowing costs of 17.3 million 2005 18.6 million for Group, and 15.9 million 2005 17.3 million for Company.
The 8.25 pence convertible redeemable preference shares were redeemed during the year by 12 June 2006.

Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages these in the manner outlined below.
Further details on risk management policy and exposure are included in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 28.
Derivative financial instruments, currency borrowings and cross currency swaps are used to reduce exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations.
There are no material unrecognised gains or losses on hedging instruments.
com Notes to the financial statements 100.
Financial instruments and fair values continued Credit risk and liquidity risk management Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to short-term liquid funds with high credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are only transacted via ISDA agreements with counterparties with good investment grade credit ratings.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk, and Directors are of the opinion that there is no material credit or liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk management At 31 December 2006, 83 per cent 2005 87 per cent of Group debt is at fixed rate, primarily in Sterling Eurobonds and USD Private Placements, and is held at amortised cost.
Interest rate swaps, collars and forward rate agreements are also used to convert variable debt to fixed.
Derivatives are only held for risk management, and not for trading.
They are not accounted for as hedges: their fair value movements are immediately booked in the income statement.
The Groups weighted average interest cost was 5.84 per cent 2005 5.81 per cent, and a one percentage movement in interest rates in the same direction across all Group currencies would impact pre-tax profit by - 4.1 million 2005 - 2.9 million.
There is no material interest rate exposure.
A section of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not directly subject to interest rate risk.
These include trade investments and equity warrants included under available-for-sale investments.
Foreign currency risk management The impact of international transactions or of translating international profits has been minimal, so these are not hedged.
The Group is, however, exposed to exchange movements on converting net currency assets.
To manage this, the policy is that between 75 per cent 90 per cent of currency assets are financed by borrowings in the same currencies or currency swaps.
Net assets exposed at year end were 223.5 million 2005 460.9 million.
A 10 per cent sterling movement in the same direction across the Groups currencies would affect assets by - 22.3 million 2005 - 46.0 million or 0.6 per cent 2005 1.44 per cent.
The Group is also exposed to its net investment in international undertakings, which it hedges by foreign currency loans and currency swaps.
US$586.1 million and a155.7million 2005 US$371.6 million and a54.2 million of UK domiciled foreign currency loans and currency swaps are designated as hedges against part of the Groups investment in subsidiaries in Continental Europe and USA.
The carrying amount of the loans and currency swaps at 31 December 2006 was 404.0 million 2005 253.2 million.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of all of these losses as it is expected that future profits will be available.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was nil 2005 nil.
No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the distribution of these profits and this is unlikely in the foreseeable future.

Retirement benefit schemes Background The Group has two defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Slough Estates 1957 Pension Scheme the Slough scheme and the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme.
Their assets are held by trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
Contributions to the schemes, assessed according to the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method of calculation, are charged to the income statement so as to spread the pensions cost over employees working lives with the Group.
The Bilton scheme was closed to new members from 2003, and the Slough scheme from October 2005.
Valuation of the Slough and Bilton schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 for Slough and 5 April 2004 for Bilton and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2006.
Assets of both schemes are stated at their market value at 31 December 2006.
The Company has an unfunded or unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS for one employee, the Chief Executive.
This arrangement is a defined benefit in nature.
The calculation of the value of this unapproved benefit promise uses assumptions which are consistent with those used for the Slough scheme.
There are no assets supporting this UURBS.
The Group has an UURBS through Slough Estates USA Incorporated for one employee.
This is a US dollar denominated defined benefit arrangement.
The calculation of the value of this unapproved benefit promise uses assumptions which are consistent with the Slough scheme and consistent with a US dollar denominated liability.
In the Netherlands the Group has two schemes.
One is an insured arrangement with a notional investment portfolio and therefore the amount of assets can only be estimated from the local reserve.
However, no contributions have been paid for 2006 and as a consequence there are no assets as at 31 December 2006.
A deficit of 547,000 at 31 December 2005 has been absorbed through the SORIE in 2006.
A premium of 30,000 is estimated to be payable in 2007 as well as an accrual of 30,000 for 2006.
The second scheme arises from the Mainland acquisition in 2005 and a charge of 63,000 has been absorbed through the SORIE in 2006.
The Group has a number of defined contribution schemes in the UK and overseas which were all expensed to the income statement.
Additionally, the Group has paid supplementary ex-gratia pensions of 0.2 million 2005 0.2 million that were paid out of profits.

Asset class returns are based on a forward looking building block approach.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yields on government bonds.
Returns on property are assumed to be 1 per cent per annum lower than those on equities.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
