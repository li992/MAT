northumbrian Water Group plc 95 Annual report and financial statements 2005 06 Shareholder information electronic communications summary financial statements Due to the relatively small number of our shareholders, there are no savings to be achieved by producing summary financial statements as well as the full annual report and financial statements.
We have introduced an electronic communications facility so that shareholders can choose to receive an email notification when the annual report is available to view or download from our website, instead of receiving a printed copy of the annual report.
To register, email the words Northumbrian Water Group shareholder to ecomms@capitaregistrars.
com and include your full name, address and Investor Code in the body of the email.
Drip scrip The Company receives occasional requests from shareholders wishing to receive their dividends in the form of shares instead of cash.
There are costs involved in providing this service, and at present it would not be cost effective.
This issue is kept under regular review.
shareDeal You can make use of a low cost share dealing service provided by Capita Registrars to buy or sell shares in NWG.
