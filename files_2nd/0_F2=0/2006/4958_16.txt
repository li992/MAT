64 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information Drax Group plc the Company is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985.
The Company and its subsidiaries together the Group operate in the electricity generation industry within the UK.
The address of the Companys registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, PO Box 3, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PQ, United Kingdom.
The operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 3 of the Companys separate financial statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities under IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures 1 IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29 IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and treasury share transactions 2 IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements Notes: 1 May not be adopted prior to endorsement, expected in June 2007.

The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments required when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
A Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to the reporting date each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group underwent a financial restructuring the Refinancing and Listing effective on 15 December 2005 which resulted in the creation of a new holding company, Drax Group plc.
Pursuant to the schemes of arrangement under which the Refinancing and Listing was implemented, the then existing debt of the Group was settled, partially through the issue of new debt and partially through the issue of ordinary shares in Drax Group plc.
Also on 15 December 2005, Drax Group plc was introduced to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and its ordinary shares commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange.
Under IFRS 3 Business combinations, the insertion of Drax Group plc as the new holding company was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, whereby Drax Group Limited being the previous Group holding company, the legal subsidiary, acquired Drax Group plc, the legal parent company.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 65 B Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Fixed assets and depreciation Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
The carrying values of fixed assets are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event that is, an event which may have resulted in an impairment by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on the directors reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is, therefore, subjective.
Pensions The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme.
The Group accounts for this scheme in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits with the cost of providing benefits determined using the projected unit credit method, and actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected returns on scheme assets, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
Deferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation, as required under IAS 12 Income taxes, at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Derivatives The Group applies IAS 32 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and IAS 39.
IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity at future dates.
The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
C Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions with or between wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Revenues from sales of Renewables Obligation Certificates ROCs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT.
Revenue is recognised at the point there is a binding agreement to sell.
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving rise to revenue.
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as giving rise to revenue.
The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.
If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.
D Segmental reporting Turnover comprises primarily sales of electricity generated by the Group to the electricity wholesale market in Great Britain.
As such, the Group has only one business segment and one geographical segment.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued E Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, and the initial estimate of costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write-down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition by the Group.
The estimated useful lives are: Years Freehold buildings, plant and machinery 440 Decommissioning asset 35 Plant spare parts 35 Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment calculated in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
Subsequent costs relating to major inspections and overhauls of the Power Station are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria of IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment are met: namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
F Impairment of tangible assets At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may have suffered an impairment loss.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset value-in-use or fair value less selling costs, if higher.
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
The discount rate applied is a pre-tax rate based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
G Decommissioning costs Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, if and when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
An amount equivalent to the initial provision is capitalised within tangible fixed assets and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
H Inventories Operating stocks of fuel and consumables are valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.
The Group is able to claim ROCs from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets OFGEM as a result of burning renewable fuels.
A market exists for sale of ROCs and the Group recognises income in the income statement at the point where there is a binding agreement to sell ROCs to a third party which transfers the risks and rewards of ownership.
The attributable incremental cost of generating ROCs above that of burning coal is included within inventory in respect of ROCs earned but not yet sold and is recognised in the income statement only as sales of ROCs are recorded.
The inventory value is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
I Emissions allowances The Group recognises its free emissions allowances received under the National Allocation Plan at nil cost.
Any additional allowances purchased in the market are recorded at cost.
The Group also recognises a liability in respect of its obligations to deliver emissions allowances.
The charge to the income statement and the related liability is measured based on the current estimates of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the net obligation, taking into account generation, free allowances allocated under the National Allocation Plan, market purchases and forward contracts already in place.
J Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 67 Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, and is charged in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the statement of recognised income and expense, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the statement of recognised income and expense.
K Pension and other post-retirement benefits The Group provides pensions through an approved industry defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The Group has taken advantage of the option within IAS 19 Employee benefits actuarial gains and losses, group plans and disclosures, to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur outside the income statement in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The current service cost and finance cost of the pension charge is deducted in arriving at operating profit.
The retirement benefits obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the net deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, gross of deferred tax.
For the defined contribution scheme, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due to be paid.
L Share-based payment Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
M Foreign currencies The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company and its principal subsidiaries.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of individual entities at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
N Financial instruments The Group applies IAS 32 and IAS 39.
IAS 39 requires that all financial assets and liabilities be measured at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reported through the income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are considered effective hedges.
IAS 32 prescribes certain disclosures on the use and impact of financial instruments designed to help the users of accounts understand the significance of the financial instruments to an entitys financial position, performance and cash flows, as well as the factors that affect amounts, timing and risks associated with future cash flows.
Financial liability and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Debt instruments The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at fair value of the consideration paid or received.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Commodity contracts Where possible, the Group takes the own use exemption permitted by IAS 39 for commodity contracts entered into and held for the purpose of the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements.
Commodity contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption are dealt with as derivatives and are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are considered to be effective hedges.
Treasury derivatives The Group uses a number of derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations.
Treasury-related derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that derivatives are considered to be effective hedges.
Income statement movements under interest rate hedges are accounted for as adjustments to finance cost income for the period.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued N Financial instruments continued Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The share premium account records the difference between the nominal value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents excludes debt service reserve and escrow account balances as these balances were restricted and could only be used for the purposes of debt service, and payment of certain Refinancing and Listing fees and expenses respectively.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, counterparty risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a management committee and central treasury function which identify evaluate and hedge financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal and other fuels and the price of CO2 emissions allowances.
Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of making sales of power when profitable compared with marginal costs of fuel and CO 2 emissions allowances.
The Group purchases coal under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources.
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and international sources.
Counterparty risk As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of coal and other goods and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers.
The Group purchases a significant portion of its coal requirement under contracts with UK Coal Mining Limited UK Coal.
There is a risk that if UK Coal falls into financial difficulty and or fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing coal from other suppliers.
Should UK Coal fall into administration, the Group could be subject to temporary loss of deliveries, higher coal prices and accelerated payments.
The Group enters into fixed price contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies.
These policies set out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its outstanding bank debt.
In particular, it is exposed to changes in the LIBOR interest rate of sterling denominated debt, as substantially all of its debt is both denominated in sterling and has a variable LIBOR rate.
The Group mitigates this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities.
Information about the Groups instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included in note 16.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency exchange contracts are principally entered into to hedge substantially all of the Groups fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in euros.

Other exceptional operating income and expenses Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Other exceptional operating income: Distributions under the TXU Claim 19.0 310.9 Reversal of impairment of tangible fixed assets 19.0 Total other exceptional operating income 19.0 329.9 Other exceptional operating expenses: LTIP expenses arising on cash and share-based payment transactions note 22 37.6 Refinancing and Listing fees and expenses 29.0 Total other exceptional operating expenses 66.6 Distributions under the TXU Claim The Group received 19.0 million under the TXU Claim in July 2006, bringing the total received to date to 329.9 million.
All amounts are net of VAT and costs and all proceeds have been used to prepay debt secured against the claim.
At the time of approving the financial statements the Group had approximately 5 million excluding VAT outstanding under the TXU Claim.
The directors have reasonable expectations that the Group will receive repayment of this amount broadly in full during 2007.
However, due to the contingent nature of insolvency proceedings, there remains uncertainty over the timing and amount of further distributions to be determined by the TXU Supervisors, and consequently these further amounts have not been recognised in the financial statements at 31 December 2006.
Reversal of impairment of tangible fixed assets In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, the Group assessed at each reporting date whether there was any indication that impairment losses recognised following the loss of the TXU Contract and its related income streams in 2002 should be reversed.
As a result of an assessment performed during the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group recorded a reversal of a tangible fixed asset impairment of 19.0 million 13.3 million net of tax.
This represented a reversal of the total impairment loss recognised in respect of tangible fixed assets at 31 December 2002 after adjusting for depreciation.
Refinancing and Listing fees and expenses The total costs of the Refinancing and Listing amounted to 44.7 million.
Of these costs, 29.0 million 20.3 million net of tax were included within other exceptional operating expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The remaining 15.7 million were deducted from debt and are being amortised to interest payable over the duration of the Groups new debt facilities.

Fees payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP and their associates for non-audit services to the Company are not required to be disclosed because the consolidated financial statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
Finance costs Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Interest payable and similar charges: Interest payable on bank borrowings 32.7 91.1 Amounts payable on termination of interest rate swaps note 18 23.1 Amortisation of deferred financing costs 4.4 0.2 Total interest payable and similar charges 37.1 114.4 Interest receivable: Interest income 13.4 5.8 Credit in respect of previously recognised unrealised losses on interest rate swaps terminated during the year note 18 17.7 Total interest receivable 13.4 23.5 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 71 8.
Taxation Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Tax charged credited comprises: Current tax 108.2 5.5 Deferred tax 62.5 24.3 170.7 18.8 Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Tax on items charged credited to equity: Deferred tax recognised on actuarial gains losses on defined benefit pension schemes 2.6 2.5 Deferred tax recognised on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 1.7 Deferred tax recognised on fair value gains losses on cash flow hedges 140.5 32.9 143.1 37.1 The tax differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% for both years.
The differences are explained below: Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Profit before tax 634.2 263.6 Profit before tax multiplied by rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% for both years 190.3 79.1 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior periods 1.2 6.2 LTIP tax deduction 9.4 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.5 2.9 Tax effect of funding arrangements 20.9 0.8 Other 0.4 0.1 Tax losses utilised 84.3 Total taxation continuing operations 170.7 18.8 Under the current financing structure, Drax Holdings Limited Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of the Company, is partially funded by a Eurobond payable to another group company, with a tax deduction being claimed for all of the corresponding interest charged in the Holdings income statement.
Were HM Revenue & Customs to successfully challenge the deductions claimed in respect of the Eurobond coupons for open years to 31 December 2006, it is estimated that the additional tax liability would be up to 40 million, together with interest and penalties.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 72 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9.
Dividends Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year based on the number of shares in issue at the record date : Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 4 pence 2005: nil per share 16.3 Special interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 80 pence 2005: nil per share 325.7 342.0 Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Amounts not recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 9.1 pence 2005: nil per share 33.6 Proposed special interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 32.9 pence 2005: nil per share 121.4 155.0 At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board is recommending to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 9.1 pence per share equivalent to 33.6 million payable on or before 16 May 2007.
The Board is also proposing, subject to the approval by shareholders of a resolution to effect a share consolidation to be considered at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2007, to pay a further interim dividend payable as a special dividend of 32.9 pence per share equivalent to 121.4 million, also payable on or before 16 May 2007.
The final dividend of 9.1 pence per share and the special dividend of 32.9 pence per share have not been included as liabilities as at 31 December 2006.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year is adjusted to take account of outstanding share options in relation to the Groups Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and contingently issuable shares under the Groups Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP.
Both the SAYE and the ESIP commenced in 2006 note 22.
The calculation of weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding assumes that the ordinary shares in Drax Group plc issued to the existing shareholders of Drax Group Limited the previous holding company on Refinancing and Listing were in issue either at 1 January 2005 to the extent that the related Drax Group Limited shares were in issue at 1 January 2005, or from the date of issue of Drax Group Limited shares to the extent that the related Drax Group Limited shares were issued after 1 January 2005.
In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per share, calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding also assumes that the share consolidation which became effective on 9 October 2006 note 21 had taken place on 1 January 2005.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below.
Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings 463.5 282.4 Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share millions 368.9 261.2 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares under share options 0.1 Effect of dilutive contingently issuable shares Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share millions 369.0 261.2 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 73 11.
Inventories As at 31 December 2006 2005 m m Raw materials and consumables 76.6 56.7 Renewables Obligation Certificates 0.3 11.1 76.9 67.8 The Groups inventory consumption was 372.2 million in 2005 and 430.0 million in 2006.
Trade and other receivables As at 31 December 2006 2005 m m Amounts falling due within one year: Trade debtors 164.1 128.4 Prepayments and other debtors 7.3 64.5 171.4 192.9 Included within prepayments and other debtors as at 31 December 2005 is 56.8 million including VAT that was received on 19 January 2006 in respect of the TXU Claim.
Trade debtors generally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had amounts receivable from nine 2005: six significant counterparties, and a number of smaller counterparties, all of which generally pay within 15 days of receipt of invoice.
Management do not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, do not believe that a further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts.

The particular elements of the restructuring relating to the Groups debt are illustrated below: As at 15 December 2005 Principal Interest m m Previous debt facilities: A1 Debt prepayment 388.2 12.8 B Debt prepayment 82.4 28.1 A2 Debt cash consideration 112.0 A2 A3 Debt interest payment 22.2 Interest rate swap termination payment 23.1 582.6 86.2 New debt facilities: Term loan 500.0 Bridge loan 77.0 577.0 Outstanding principal and interest in relation to A1 and B Debt was repaid in full.
In addition, interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of 400 million, principally related to A1 Debt, were terminated.
A2 A3 Debt holders contributed their A2 A3 Debt in exchange for cash and ordinary shares of 10 pence each in Drax Group plc.
In total, A2 Debt holders received cash consideration of 112.0 million and A2 A3 Debt holders received 124,164,221 ordinary shares of 10 pence each in Drax Group plc.
Outstanding interest on A2 A3 Debt was repaid in full.
The total cash outflows related to the Refinancing and Listing were partially funded by a new Term loan of 500.0 million and a Bridge loan of 77.0 million as described below.
On 11 May 2006, the Group entered into a new credit facility agreement providing a further 100.0 million Term loan on similar terms and with a similar repayment profile to the existing term borrowings.
The facility was drawn down in full on 3 July 2006 and partially used to make a payment of 22.5 million into the employee pension scheme to reduce the actuarial deficit.

Financial liabilities borrowings continued Analysis of borrowings Borrowings at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 consisted of bank loans held by the Companys subsidiary Drax Finance Limited as follows: As at 31 December 2006 Borrowings Deferred before deferred finance costs Net finance costs note 5 borrowings m m m Term loans 485.0 11.7 473.3 Bridge loan 2.9 2.9 Total borrowings 487.9 11.7 476.2 Less current portion of debt 20.0 0.2 19.8 Non-current borrowings 467.9 11.5 456.4 As at 31 December 2005 Borrowings Deferred before deferred finance costs Net finance costs note 5 borrowings m m m Term loan 500.0 15.5 484.5 Bridge loan 77.0 77.0 Total borrowings 577.0 15.5 561.5 Less current portion of debt 105.1 3.7 101.4 Non-current borrowings 471.9 11.8 460.1 The Term loans are subject to a fixed amortisation profile ending on 31 December 2010 and debt service payments are made semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December.
Payment profiles for repayment of debt set out above are based on the fixed minimum repayment profile.
Repayments above the fixed minimum repayment profile are permitted subject to the amount of cash available for debt service.
57.5 million of the Term loan was repaid on 30 June 2006 and 57.5 million of the Term loan was repaid on 29 December 2006, in line with the target repayment profile as a result of the levels of cash available for debt service.
The Bridge loan has a first priority over the TXU Claim and the proceeds thereof, which are its primary source of repayment.
The Bridge loan has no fixed amortisation profile, with the timing of repayments determined by receipts under the TXU Claim.
Following distributions under the TXU Claim in January and July 2006, 55.1 million of the Bridge loan was repaid on 23 January 2006 and a further 19.0 million was repaid on 25 July 2006.
Any outstanding principal balance falls due for payment on 31 December 2008.
Ultimately, the Groups ability to make repayments of the Term loan is entirely dependent on the successful operation of the business.
The ability of the Group to make repayments of the Bridge loan is dependent on: i the timing and quantum of recoveries under the TXU Claim: and ii the extent that such recoveries are insufficient to pay amounts under the Bridge loan when due, the successful operation of the business.
The Groups debt is guaranteed and secured directly by each of the principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company, as set out in note 3 to the Companys separate financial statements.
Drax Group plc is not a guarantor of the Groups debt, but has granted a charge over the shares in its subsidiary, Drax Finance Limited.
Letter of Credit facility and Revolving Credit facility In addition to its borrowings, the Group has access to a Letter of Credit facility which provides credit support of up to 200 million to the Groups trading activities.
The Letter of Credit facility, which has a final maturity date of 15 December 2012, provides a mechanism whereby it may be extended for a further 12 months at any time after 15 December 2007, but no later than one year before the final maturity date.
The Group guarantees the obligations of a number of banks in respect of the letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group.
As at 31 December 2006 the Groups contingent liability in respect of these guarantees amounted to 153.6 million 2005: 77.4 million.
In addition, the Group has access to an undrawn 100 million Revolving Credit facility, which may be used to issue letters of credit or for working capital, with a final maturity date of 15 December 2010.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 77 17.
Other non-current liabilities As at 31 December 2006 2005 m m Retentions 0.7 0.7 The retention liabilities relate to amounts held back from certain suppliers pending satisfaction of contractually agreed performance criteria.
The Group estimates that substantially all retention liabilities will fall due for payment in more than one year but in not more than two years.
Derivatives and financial lnstruments The Group issues or holds financial instruments for two purposes: financial instruments relating to the financing and risks of the Groups operations: and financial instruments relating to the financing and risks of the Groups debt portfolio.
The Groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, items that arise directly from its operations and derivative contracts.
The Group also enters into short-term and medium-term forward sales contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of coal and CO emissions allowances.
2 The following table sets out the fair value of financial instruments at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005: As at 31 December 2006 As at 31 December 2005 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Commodity contracts 346.1 3.1 7.2 222.4 Interest rate swaps 4.8 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 0.2 3.7 0.8 0.2 Total 351.1 6.8 8.0 222.6 Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts 89.1 0.3 49.6 Interest rate swaps 4.8 Current portion 257.2 6.8 7.
7 173.0 Commodity contracts The Group enters into short-term and medium-term forward electricity sales contracts to hedge generation output.
The Group also purchases coal and CO2 emissions allowances under contracts from a range of domestic and international suppliers.
Due to the nature of some of these contracts and the way they are managed, the own use exemption within IAS 39 has only been applied to a limited number of them.
For the purposes of IAS 39, from 1 July 2005, the Group has put in place appropriate hedge accounting documentation to enable it to achieve hedge accounting for a large proportion of its commodity contracts.
As a result, mark-to-market movements on contracts which are now considered to be effective hedges are recognised through the hedge reserve.
For the period from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2005, mark-to-market movements on these contracts were reflected directly in the income statement, as appropriate hedge documentation had not been put in place.
The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments is calculated by reference to forward market prices which are available at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Interest rate swaps The Group enters into interest rate swap arrangements to hedge variable interest costs on the Groups debt.
As required under the terms of the Groups new debt facility agreements effective 15 December 2005, interest rate swap contracts with notional principal amounts of 250 million were entered into on 5 January 2006.
At 1 January 2005, the notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts related to the Groups previous debt facilities was 400 million.
As described in note 16, the Group terminated these interest rate swap contracts on Refinancing and Listing on 15 December 2005, resulting in a credit adjustment to release the previously recognised unrealised losses of 17.7 million and a termination payment of 23.1 million, both of which were included in finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2005 note 7.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18.
Derivatives and financial instruments continued Forward foreign currency exchange contracts Foreign currency exchange contracts are principally entered into to hedge the Groups requirement to purchase coal from international sources in US dollars, and to purchase CO2 emissions allowances in euros.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives The Group has also reviewed all contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives.
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and, therefore, do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
The amounts recorded in the income statement in respect of derivatives which are marked-to-market are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Unrealised gains losses on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 90.8 117.0 Credited to interest receivable in respect of derivative contracts terminated during the year 17.7 90.8 99.3 The amounts recorded in the hedge reserve in respect of derivatives which are marked-to-market are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Unrealised gains losses on derivative contracts note 25 468.2 109.7 Net fair values of derivative financial instruments The net fair values of derivative financial instruments were: As at 31 December 2006 2005 m m Contracts with positive fair values Commodity contracts 343.0 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 0.6 Interest rate swaps 4.8 347.8 0.6 Contracts with negative fair values Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 3.5 Commodity contracts 215.2 3.5 215.2 The carrying amounts of cash at bank and in hand, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables approximate their fair value.
As a result of their terms, the carrying amounts of the Term and Bridge loans approximate their fair value.
Provisions Re-instatement m At 1 January 2005 0.1 Additional provision in the year 1.9 At 31 December 2005 2.0 Unwinding of discount 0.2 At 31 December 2006 2.2 The provision for re-instatement represents the estimated decommissioning, demolition and site remediation costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, on a discounted basis.
An amount equivalent to the initial provision is capitalised within tangible fixed assets and is being depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 79 The provision is estimated using the assumption that the re-instatement will take place between 2039 and 2045.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology at current prices.
The discount rate applied is the pre-tax rate based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30% 2005: 30%.
The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below: Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Deferred tax liability at 1 January 185.3 246.7 Charged credited to income statement 62.5 24.3 Deferred tax on actuarial gains losses on defined benefit pension schemes 2.6 2.5 Deferred tax recognised on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 1.7 Deferred tax recognised on fair value gains losses on cash flow hedges 140.5 32.9 Deferred tax liability at 31 December 390.9 185.3 The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

Two ordinary shares were allotted and fully paid on incorporation.
Issued on Refinancing and Listing There were 94,254,480 shares of Drax Group Limited, the previous holding company, in issue as at 31 December 2004, with a nominal value of 943 and a related share premium of 0.5 million.
Ordinary shares in Drax Group plc were issued upon Refinancing and Listing as described below.
Under IFRS 3, the insertion of Drax Group plc as the new holding company was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, whereby Drax Group Limited, the legal subsidiary, acquired Drax Group plc, the legal parent company.
Pursuant to the schemes of arrangement under which the Refinancing and Listing was implemented, the existing shareholders of Drax Group Limited received three ordinary shares of 10 pence each in Drax Group plc in exchange for each share in Drax Group Limited.
This resulted in the issue of 282,763,440 ordinary shares in Drax Group plc.
Under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, Drax Group plc qualified for merger relief to avoid recording a share premium on the shares issued to the existing shareholders of Drax Group Limited.
Accordingly, Drax Group plc recorded these shares within share capital at their nominal value of 28.3 million, with a corresponding debit to share premium of 0.5 million and the merger reserve of 27.8 million to reflect the reverse acquisition adjustment note 27.
As described in note 16, A2 A3 Debt holders contributed their A2 A3 Debt in exchange for cash and ordinary shares of 10 pence each in Drax Group plc.
The Group settled the remaining nominal value of A2 A3 Debt, after deduction of the A2 cash consideration, of 433.1 million in exchange for issuing the 124,164,221 ordinary shares in Drax Group plc.
The directors determined that the nominal value of A2 A3 Debt approximated its fair value by reference to the terms of the debt, principally the ability to prepay at nominal value.
The nominal value of shares issued of 12.4 million was therefore lower than the fair value of the asset acquired of 433.1 million.
Under Section 130 of the Companies Act 1985, the shares were treated as issued fully paid up and the difference of 420.7 million recorded as share premium note 27.
Issued under employee share schemes On 23 May 2006, the Company issued 157,734 ordinary shares of 10 pence each at par to a trust on behalf of qualifying employees under the Groups Share Incentive Plan note 22.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 81 Effect of share consolidation The Company undertook a share consolidation in connection with the interim special dividend paid on 25 October 2006 note 9.
On 27 September 2006, 13 ordinary shares of 10 pence each were issued to Deutsche Bank AG in their capacity as market maker at market value.
The purpose of this issue was to make the share consolidation calculation exact.
Following approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 6 October 2006, the share consolidation under which shareholders 1 received 29 new ordinary shares of 11 29 pence each for every 32 existing ordinary shares of 10 pence each, became effective on 9 October 2006.
The Company has only one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income.
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
Redeemable shares On 20 October 2005, the Company authorised and issued 499,980 redeemable shares of 10 pence each to Drax Group Limited.
These shares were fully paid up prior to 31 December 2005 and subsequently redeemed in full on 22 December 2006.
As the shares did not entitle the holder to any dividend or residual interest in the Company and were manditorily redeemable, they were accounted for as debt in accordance with IAS 32.
Share-based payments Share-based incentive plans During 2006, the Group introduced two all-employee share plans, the Share Incentive Plan SIP and the Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and an Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP, to provide long-term incentives for executive directors, senior managers and all other employees.
Under the SIP, the Company issued a total of 157,734 ordinary shares to a trust on behalf of qualifying employees, equating to 254 shares with a cash value of approximately 2,000 per employee based on the Companys share price at the time of the awards in May 2006.
The fair value of the SIP awards determined at the grant date of 1.3 million was charged to the income statement in full in 2006, on the basis that employees obtained certain rights in relation to shares issued to the trust on their behalf.
In July 2006, participation in the SAYE was offered to all qualifying employees.
Options were granted for employees to acquire shares at a price of 6.36 representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules, exercisable at the end of the three and five year savings contracts.
The fair value of the 899,396 options granted in connection with the SAYE of 0.5 million is being charged to the income statement over the life of the respective plans.
Under the ESIP, annual awards of performance shares are made at nil consideration to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 100% of salary 200% in exceptional circumstances.
Shares vest according to whether Draxs TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years.
The first conditional ESIP awards over 390,213 ordinary shares were granted in September 2006, with performance measured over the three years to 30 June 2009 and potential vesting in September 2009.
The fair value of the ESIP awards determined at the grant date of 1.9 million, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting, is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period.
No shares have been issued or repurchased to date with respect to the SAYE or ESIP.
Given that these share-based incentive plans have commenced only recently, the level of forfeitures is not significant.
Additional information in relation to the Groups share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.
Drax Group Limited Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP had at its disposal a cash pool of 5.1 million the payment of which was dependent upon certain parts of the Groups previous debt being repaid and 4,323,600 non-voting shares in Drax Group Limited, the previous holding company.
Initial Awards under the LTIP were made to employees selected by the Remuneration Committee in May 2004, comprising a total of 549,923 non-voting shares purchased at a price of 13.65 pence per share by such employees and cash units giving a proportionate entitlement to sums payable from time to time out of the 5.1 million cash pool.
The remaining 3,773,677 non-voting shares were subsequently issued to the LTIP trustee.
Performance Awards under the LTIP were made to employees selected by the Remuneration Committee in January, June and October 2005, comprising share units giving a proportionate entitlement to the non-voting shares held by the LTIP trustee subject to the satisfaction of associated performance criteria and cash units giving a proportionate entitlement to sums payable from time-to-time out of the 5.1 million cash pool.
Under the terms of the LTIP, the Refinancing and Listing on 15 December 2005 caused all cash and share-based awards under the LTIP to fully vest.
All Performance Awards vested in the beneficiaries, giving them a proportionate right according to their respective holdings of share units, to the non-voting shares held by the LTIP trustee.
Existing shareholders in Drax Group Limited, including LTIP shareholders, received three ordinary shares of 10 pence each in Drax Group plc in exchange for each ordinary share in Drax Group Limited.
Full repayment of eligible debt resulted in the total 5.1 million payable under the LTIP cash pool becoming due to beneficiaries, according to their respective holdings of cash units.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 82 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Share-based payments continued The LTIP expense arising on share-based payment transactions for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 25.2 million was determined from the Groups estimate of the market value of the shares included in the first Performance Award made in January 2005.
The valuation relates to all of the 3,773,677 shares held by the LTIP trustee, as all such shares vested on Refinancing and Listing.
Although subsequent Performance Awards were made later in 2005, these awards served only to alter the proportionate rights of holdings in LTIP units of participants.
This amount was charged to the income statement in full in 2005.
There was no expense arising from shares subject to Initial Awards in 2004, as the Group determined that the fair value of its equity was nil at that time.
The remaining expense arising from cash-based payment transactions of 4.7 million 0.4 million having been charged in 2004 was also charged to the income statement in 2005, following vesting of the awards.
The total charge with respect to the LTIP, including Employer National Insurance contributions on cash and share-based transactions, of 37.6 million 26.3 million net of tax was included within exceptional other operating expenses in the 2005 income statement note 5.
Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to the LTIP and other share-based payments are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m LTIP expenses arising on share-based payment transactions 25.2 LTIP expenses arising on cash-based payment transactions 4.7 Social security costs arising on share and cashbased payment transactions 7.7 Total LTIP expenses arising on cash and share-based payment transactions 37.6 SIP 1.3 SAYE 0.1 ESIP 0.3 1.7 37.6 Share option pricing For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payments charge for the SAYE, a Black Scholes model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows: As at 31 December 2006 2005 Dividend yield 14.7% Risk-free interest rate 4.8% Volatility 27.2% Expected life of the options three and five years The weighted average fair values of share options granted during the period were: As at 31 December 2006 2005 pence pence SAYE Three year savings plan 73 Five year savings plan 50 Shares held under trust Shares in the Company held under trust during the year were as follows: Nominal Market Shares Shares value at value at held at Shares Shares held at 31 December 31 December Dividends 1 January acquired transferred 31 December 2006 2006 waived 2006 during year during year 2006 000 000 SIP 142,830 2,760 140,070 15 1,143 The amounts included in the table have been adjusted to reflect the share consolidation which became effective on 9 October 2006 note 21.
