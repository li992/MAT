Reserves Prior Year Restatements Prioryear comparatives have been restated for the followingitems: a To correct the method of calculating the elimination of intra-group profit carried in inventory, the effect of which is to reduce the amount of overhead expense included in inventory valuation.
This is a correctionof an errorand has a  taxation effect.
b To correct the classification of certain indirect production overhead expenses from Administration expenses to Cost of goods sold.
c A change in accounting policy for the recognition of the death-in-service benefits liability in the UK pension plan.
Under IFRS alternative treatments are permissible however management believes that it is more appropriate to apply the projected unit credit method rather than the value at risk approach previously adopted as this better reflects the Groups obligations and costs.
The effect of adopting this policy has been to increase the retirement benefit obligation and consequential deferred taxation under IFRS and eliminate the reconcilingitem between IFRS and US GAAP.
The effects of the above matters on the Group Income Statement, Earnings per share, Group Balance Sheet and Group Statement of Recognised Incomeand Expense are as follows: Earnings per share Including Discontinued Continuing Group IncomeStatement Operations Operations Trading Attributable profit i Taxation profit ii Basic Diluted Basic Diluted $ million cents per ordinaryshare 2006 Under previous accountingpolicy....... 572 156 746 79.3 79.0 42.0 41.8 Death inservice liability.... 1 1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Under new accounting policy................. 571 156 745 79.2 78.9 41.9 41.7 2005 As previouslyreported..... 526 129 339 36.1 35.9 32.8 32.6 Correctionof eliminationof intragroupprofit........ 9 3 6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 As restated.............. 517 126 333 35.5 35.3 32.2 32.0 2004 As previouslyreported..... 460 80 250 26.7 26.5 23.7 23.6 Correctionof eliminationof intragroupprofit........ 8 3 5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 As restated.............. 452 77 245 26.2 26.0 23.2 23.1 i The effect of the reclassification of indirect production overheads resulted in the following within trading profit: cost of goods sold increased by $37m in 2005 2004 $39m and  decreased by $37m in 2005 2004 $39m.
