54 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 4 Other operating income 2006 2005 as restated 000 000 Other operating income comprises the following items: Gains on disposal of significant investments 15,355 12,484 Gains losses on disposal of subsidiaries and contracts 3,026 3,616 Exceptional gains 18,381 8,868 Gains on disposal of other investments 5,729 1,163 Other income 2,196 1,016 7,925 2,179 26,306 11,047 2006 The gains on disposal of significant investments in 2006 comprises gains realised on i the sale of the Group's investment in New Star Asset Management Group PLC which was sold on 11 November 2005: and ii contingent deferred consideration received in respect of the sale, in January 2005, of the Group's investment in Lombard International Assurance SA.
The gain includes the transfer of 8.6 million from the available for sale reserve.
The gains on disposal of subsidiaries and contracts comprises of a gain of 2,946,000 on the sale of the Groups UK private client business, and net deferred proceeds received in the current year in respect of disposals completed in previous years.
The Board considers that these two categories of gains are outwith the course of the Groups normal business and sufciently material that they should be disclosed separately to enable a proper understanding of the financial statements, and has therefore chosen to disclose these items as exceptional gains.
Gains on disposal of other investments includes 3,807,000 of deferred consideration received from the sale, in October 2003, of Asset Value Investors Limited.
These proceeds form an element of a wider transaction, the substance of which was to retain an interest in an ongoing revenue stream until 30 September 2006.
2005 The Group disposed of its investment in the ordinary shares of Lombard International Assurance SA Lombard, a Luxembourg registered life company, on 11 January 2005 to Friends Provident plc.
The Groups holding represented approximately 15% of the equity of Lombard, the original cost of which was 1,163,000.
The gain on disposal recognised to date, net of expenses, is 12,484,000.
Further consideration will be received in April 2006 and April 2007, dependent on Lombard achieving or exceeding certain performance targets for both new business profits and growth in embedded value for the two financial years to 31 December 2006.
The further consideration will be paid in cash or Friends Provident ordinary shares, at Friends Providents option.
No tax arose on the disposal of this asset as it was held in a jurisdiction in which no tax was charged on the capital gain.
The loss on disposal of subsidiaries of 3,616,000 represents the loss realised on disposal of the Groups Isle of Man and Guernsey life assurance subsidiaries.
This loss is reduced by 2,796,000 of contingent deferred proceeds received in the current year in respect of disposals completed in previous years.
The Group also received 1,163,000 of deferred proceeds in respect of the sale of Asset Value Investors Limited which was sold in 2004.
These proceeds form an element of a wider transaction, the substance of which was to retain an interest in an ongoing revenue stream until 30 September 2006, and are therefore not considered to be exceptional.

60 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 13 Earnings per share The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profits and numbers of shares.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share gures are calculated by adjusting the net profit to exclude exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of exceptional and non-cash items.

In addition a deferred tax provision of 23.8 million has been made in respect of timing differences in relation to the intangible assets.
Goodwill has arisen on business combinations which the Group, in accordance with its business strategy and practice, has integrated with its continuing business activities.
The Group has determined that it has two business segments or cash generating units CGUs for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets: i the investment management division and ii the property asset management division.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the most appropriate CGU.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to each segment is as follows: Group Company 2006 2005 2006 2005 000 000 000 000 Investment management 539,918 454,960 5,088 4,916 Property asset management 13,647 13,362 553,565 468,322 5,088 4,916 The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use cash ow projections based on the Group's latest approved budget which covers the 2006 7 financial year.
The long term cash ow projections extrapolate the 2006 7 budget gures over ten years with assumptions made on revenue, market growth and increases in overheads to cover ination and increased levels of business.
Revenue is assumed to increase at a rate based on the Groups recent experience of new business inows.
Equity assets under management AUM are assumed to increase by 6% per annum and xed income AUM by 3% per annum to reect general market performance and or reinvestment of income by clients.
Increases in operating costs have been factored in at existing rates to cover assumed new business volumes and an allowance of 3% per annum has been made for general ination of costs.
To arrive at a net present value the cash ows are discounted using the Group's weighted average cost of capital which has been calculated at 10.5% at 30 September 2006.
The value-in-use is estimated by calculating a terminal value and adding this to the net present value of the cash ows.
This overall value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets in order to assess whether any impairment exists.
The Board considers the terminal value fairly reects the long term nature of the business and there is no reason to believe that the business will not continue in the long term.
The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions underpinning the cash ow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted in estimating the final value-in-use.
The review also covers management contracts in respect of open ended funds which are considered to have indefinite lives and are therefore not subject to amortisation.
These assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets revealed a surplus of value-in-use over book value for both CGUs and therefore no impairment charge is required.

The acquisition was effected by the transfer of certain legal entities to Aberdeen and the novation of certain client mandates.
On 30 September 2005 Aberdeen paid 133.4 million in respect of the London xed interest business, and the OEIC business and the equities and multi-asset business.
On 1 December 2005, the Philadelphia xed income business was acquired for a cash consideration of 73 million and the further elements of the UK businesses were acquired for a consideration of 50.4 million.
The deferred consideration in respect of the equities & multi-asset business was nalised during the year which resulted in a payment of 24.6 million being made.
This was 10.4 million less than the provisional estimate and was based on the value of run-rate management fees on assets retained within this business.
Provisional fair values were assigned to the assets acquired at 30 September 2005.
They were nalised during 2006 resulting in the adjustments shown in the table below.
These adjustments reect a re-allocation of value between goodwill and intangible assets plus the recognition of deferred tax of 23.8 million in respect of the intangible assets.
An independent rm of valuation specialists was engaged to carry out a valuation exercise of the goodwill and intangible assets acquired.
The value of goodwill in the acquisition takes account of the value of the assembled workforce in place and the value of new business ows.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 the goodwill has been adjusted from the date of acquisition and the 2005 comparatives have been restated.
The table opposite shows the provisional fair values of the assets acquired at 30 September 2005 and the subsequent fair value adjustments together with the fair value of the assets acquired on 1 December 2005.

Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 77 Notes to the Accounts continued 29 Financial instruments continued Foreign net investment The majority of the Group's subsidiaries use sterling as their reporting currencies.
The foreign currency net monetary assets of subsidiaries which adopt a different reporting currency are as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 US dollar 14,267 2,932 Singapore dollar 14,458 1,767 Australian dollar 1,400 1,367 Nordic currencies 12,970 1,240 Other 3,111 2,465 Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Group's life assurance subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which avail clients of a number of benets from these pooled arrangements.
From the Group's perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to these assets invested also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, our clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
While by necessity this Group subsidiary company has some insurance risks, these risks are completely reinsured, thereby negating any ultimate insurance risk to the Group's equity holders.
The unit linked assets are matched by the associated insurance contract liabilities disclosed in note 19.
The assets are all unit linked and held for the sole benefit of the policyholders within Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.

These accounting policies have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2005, and in the preparation of an opening IFRS Balance Sheet at 1 October 2004 the Group's date of transition to IFRS.
In preparing its opening IFRS Balance Sheet, the Group has adjusted the amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its previous basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Group's financial position, financial performance and cash ows is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.
The Group issued its IFRS transition statement on 28 March 2006 in which it outlined the impact of the changes in accounting treatment under IFRS on the financial results of the Group previously reported under UK GAAP.
At the time the Groups interpretation of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements resulted in the consolidation of certain companies where the Groups private equity business were deemed to have controlling interest.
The Group has reviewed its interpretation of the standard and has concluded that there is no requirement under IAS 27 to consolidate these companies.
The following tables therefore differ from those issued in the transition statement as they exclude the adjustments previously included in respect of IAS 27.
The impact on equity at the date of transition was 1.8 million and the impact on profit after tax at 30 September 2005 was an increase of 1.1 million.
The analysis below sets out the most significant adjustments arising from the transition to IFRS.
IFRS 2: Share-based Payment The Group recognises a charge to the income statement for the fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees after 7 November 2002.
The charge is calculated using a binomial lattice valuation model and is charged over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reect actual and expected levels of vesting, which are dependent on forfeit rates and the satisfaction of performance conditions.
Under UK GAAP there was no charge to the income statement for share options granted to employees.
There is no change in respect of shares issued under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The UK GAAP policy of charging to profit or loss the fair value of LTIP awards, adjusted to reect actual and expected levels of vesting and spread over the relevant performance and vesting periods, will continue under IFRS.
The impact of the charge for share options is to increase balance sheet equity at 1 October 2004 by 0.1 million.
The effect for the year to 30 September 2005 is to increase the post tax charge in the income statement by 0.1 million.
84 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 37 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued IFRS 3: Business Combinations In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the Group has elected to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the date of transition.
This results in i the value of goodwill and intangible assets recognised on previous acquisitions being frozen at their respective carrying values in the consolidated balance sheet at 1 October 2004: and ii the reversal of any amortisation charged in the year to 30 September 2005.
IFRS 3 requires intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination to be separately identied.
A review of the businesses acquired from Deutsche Bank in late 2005 has therefore been undertaken for this purpose.
This acquisition was completed in two stages, on 30 September and 1 December 2005.
A valuation exercise has been carried out which has identied 135.6 million of fair value in respect of client contracts and relationships which fall to be treated as intangible assets.
Of this amount, 85.8 million relates to the xed income business and equities and multi-assets business, which will be amortised on a straight line basis over 10 years.
The remaining 49.8 million relates to the open end funds which are considered to have an indefinite life.
This item will not be amortised but will be subject to an annual impairment review.
From 1 October 2004 goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review, and more frequently if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The impact of this change is to increase the balance sheet equity at 30 September 2005 by 19.5 million and to reduce the post tax charge in the income statement by 19.5 million.
The intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of the DeAM xed income business has no impact on the income statement for the year to 30 September.
However, the amortisation of these assets will result in a charge to the income statement of 8.5million for the year to 30 September 2006 and an annual charge of 8.5 million in subsequent years.
IAS 10: Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
The Group recognises dividends declared after the balance sheet date in the reporting period in which they are declared, as they represent non-adjusting events after the balance sheet date under IFRS.
This change results in an increase in balance sheet equity at 1 October 2004 of 4.7 million.
The effect for the year to 30 September 2005 is to decrease the dividend recorded in the year by 6.1 million and to increase balance sheet equity at 30 September 2005 by 10.8 million.
IAS 19: Employee Benets The Group recognises the net liability on dened benefit schemes in the balance sheet and takes all actuarial gains and losses to the statement of recognised income and expense, in accordance with the methods of recognition permitted by the amendment to IAS 19, issued in December 2004.
Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for dened benefit schemes in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
In addition, adjustments to staff costs have been made in accordance with IAS 19 to reect the short-term employee benets accrued holiday entitlement not recognised under UK GAAP.
These changes reduce balance sheet equity at 1 October 2004 by 14.0 million.
The effect for the year to 30 September 2005 is to increase the post tax charge in the income statement by 0.4 million and to reduce balance sheet equity by 19.3 million.
A net charge of 4.8 million has been recognised directly in equity.
IAS 38: Intangible Assets Under UK GAAP capitalised software and licence costs were included within property, plant and equipment.
In compliance with IAS 38, these have been reclassied as other intangible assets.
The net book value of amounts reclassied were 3.2 million at 1 October 2004 and 1.7 million at 30 September 2005.
The change has no effect on the balance sheet equity at 1 October 2004 or at 30 September 2005 and nor is there any effect on the income statement for the year to 30 September 2005.
IAS 18: Revenue Under IAS 18, when the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction should be recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The guidance issued in the appendix to IAS 18 on the application of this principle states that revenues earned on investment management contracts, and related incremental costs associated with securing such contracts, should be recognised over the life of the contract.
Under UK GAAP, and in accordance with industry practice, the Group recognised initial income on the sale of shares in open ended investment companies, and any related initial commissions payable to intermediaries, on completion of the sale contract.
This is no longer permitted under the current interpretation of IAS 18 and such revenue and costs are therefore spread over the estimated average life of the contract.
These changes reduce balance sheet equity at 1 October 2004 by 0.8 million.
The effect on the year to 30 September 2005 is to increase the post tax profit in the income statement by 0.1 million and to reduce balance sheet equity by 0.7 million.

These standards were adopted prospectively from 1 October 2005.
