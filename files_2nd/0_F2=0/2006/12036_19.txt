60 Persimmon Plc Notes to the Financial Statements 12 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust and the Employee Benefit Trust see note 22, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares from the start of the accounting period.
The Company has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options and awards granted to directors and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Earnings before Weighted Weighted reorganisation average average costs Earnings number of Earnings number of 2006 2006 ordinary shares 2005 ordinary shares m m 2006 m 2005 For basic earnings per share 407.3 396.4 296,155,856 344.8 291,120,186 Options and awards 1,762,783 1,116,307 For diluted earnings per share 407.3 396.4 297,918,639 344.8 292,236,493 Reorganisation costs net of related tax credit of 4.5m.

50m of this brought forward amount represents the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the brand intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Management used a discount factor of 7%.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
The remainder of goodwill is allocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts are determined by performing a value in use calculation, using a discount factor of 7%, covering a period of 30 years being the minimum period that management expects to benefit from the acquired strategic land holdings and based on current market conditions.
It is tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
Acquired know how is amortised over its estimated useful life, which is 10 years from the date of its inception.

20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and liabilities Details of the Groups use of financial instruments is included in the Financial Review on page 27.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are as disclosed below.
The Groups financial assets comprise cash at bank, trade receivables and other receivables.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise bank and other borrowings, finance lease obligations, land payables, trade payables and other payables.
Derivative financial instruments The funding activities of the Group expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group utilises both interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to variability in liabilities.
These are entered into exclusively in relation to the US Dollar and Euro denominated senior loan notes, which are retranslated to their fair value at each period end.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Interest rate risk Financial assets Interest on bank balances is calculated on a daily basis, at a rate linked to base rate.
No interest is received on trade or other receivables.

Floating rate financial liabilities are linked to base rate in relation to bank overdrafts and to LIBOR for other loans.
Credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at both 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
The Group has no substantial exposure to any individual third party.
The maximum loss that would be suffered if another party failed to perform is 4.6m 2005: 1.0m.
The assets are secured upon property, therefore management consider the debt to be low risk.

Certain land payables are secured upon land.
No other collateral is held against financial assets of the Group.
Currency risk All US and EU senior loan notes were swapped into Sterling on issue.
The Group has no other significant foreign currency dealings.
After taking account of currency swaps the Group had no exposure to currency fluctuations as at 31 December 2006 2005: nil.
Fair values Financial assets The carrying amount of financial assets equates to their fair value.
Financial liabilities The fair value of the senior loan notes and their related hedging instruments is determined by discounting risk-adjusted expected future cash flows with application of current market foreign exchange rates.
The carrying amount of the remaining financial liabilities equates to their fair value.

Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share option schemes, the details of which are provided below.
In accordance with IFRS 2, only costs relating to options issued after 7 November 2002 have been charged to the income statement.
The Save As You Earn Scheme is an HMRC approved scheme open to all employees.
Options can normally be exercised three years after the date of grant.
Options have been issued to senior management including the executive Directors under the Groups various executive share option schemes.
The long term incentive plan LTIP is also an executive share scheme.
Vesting of options granted under the LTIP is dependant on the Groups return on capital employed and its total shareholder return versus a comparator group of house building companies.
These conditions have been factored into the option value applied.
During 2006 awards were granted to executive Directors under the Groups Synergy Incentive Plan.
Vesting of awards is dependent on a performance condition, details of which are set out on page 45.
