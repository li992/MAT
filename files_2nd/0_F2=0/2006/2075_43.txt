Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the BHP Billiton Group and so most currency exposure relates to transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The BHP Billiton Group has potential currency exposures in respect of items denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation comprising: transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues translational exposure in respect of investments in overseas operations translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items The potential currency exposures are discussed below.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Operating expenditure and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These risks are managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
When required under this strategy, foreign exchange hedging contracts are entered into in foreign exchange markets.
Operating and capital costs are hedged using forward exchange and currency option contracts.
The Group generally hedges the non-US dollar currency exposure of major capital expenditure projects.
Forward contracts taken out under this policy are separately disclosed below as Relating to capital expenditure hedging.
In addition, the Group enters into arrangements to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows and non-US dollar exposures in marketing contracts.
Forward contracts taken out under this policy are separately disclosed below as Relating to operating activities.

There are certain operations that have Australian dollars and UK pounds sterling as a functional currency.
Foreign currency gains or losses arising on translation of the net assets of these operations are shown as a movement in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Where market conditions make it beneficial, the Group will borrow in currencies which would create translational exposure and will swap the liability into an appropriate currency.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement, with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for restoration and rehabilitation that are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The foreign currency risk is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.

The BHP Billiton Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The BHP Billiton Groups policy on counterparty credit exposures ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
The BHP Billiton Groups liquidity risk for derivatives arises from the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the BHP Billiton Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.

Commodity price risk is managed pursuant to the Portfolio Risk Management strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
Strategic price hedges are taken out from time to time.

Embedded derivatives Derivatives embedded in host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts or have intrinsic value at inception and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Contracts are assessed for embedded derivatives when the group becomes a party to them, including at the date of a business combination.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value at each period end.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Host contracts which incorporate embedded derivatives are entered into during the normal course of operations and are standard business practices in these industries.
