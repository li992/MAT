The Groups equity-settled share-based payments comprise the Restricted Share Plan RSP, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Share Incentive Plan SIP, various Sharesave Plans and two recruitment schemes relating to the Chief Executive, the Recruitment Award Agreement RAA and the Co-Investment Share Plan CISP.
The RSP was used for the last time in June 2003.
The Company expenses an estimate of how many shares are likely to vest based on the market price at the date of grant, taking account of expected performance against the net asset value per share growth target and the three year service period.
Under the SIP the Company gives eligible employees free shares of up to 3,000 a year.
They can also purchase partnership shares for up to 1,500 a year that are matched 2 for 1 by the Company.
The free and matching shares are purchased at fair value in the market and expensed at the time of allocation.
At the 2003 AGM the shareholders approved the LTIP whereby the Company may award employees a combination of performance shares and options.
Both components have the same performance targets based on net asset value per share growth and a three-year service period.
Performance shares are valued at the market value at the date of the award.
The options are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends according to the table below: Long-Term Incentive Plan: 2006 awards 31 May 2005 5 December 2005 Share price at grant date 877p 994p Exercise price 877p 994p Option life in years maximum 10 57 Risk free rate 4.3% 4.4% Expected volatility 30% 20% Expected dividend yield 2.0% 2.0% Value per option 243p 241p For both LTIP components the Company estimates the number of shares or options likely to vest and expenses that value over the relevant period.
Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price over a four year period and adjusting where there are known factors that may affect future volatility.
Vesting estimates take account of the Companys high staff retention rate.
Movements in shares and options are given in note 20.
Under the Sharesave Plans eligible employees can save up to 250 a month over a three or five year period and use the savings to exercise an option granted at the outset at a 20% discount to the then prevailing share price.
The fair value of the various options is expensed over the service period, based on a Black-Scholes model, assuming, for the grants during the current year, a risk-free rate ranging from 4.3% to 4.4%, expected volatility ranging from 20% to 30% and an expected dividend yield of 2.0%.
The values per option for these schemes range from 276 pence to 316 pence.
There are no performance measures.
An estimated 5% of the three year options and 7% of the five-year options are assumed to lapse as employees leave the Company prior to the minimum service period.
Awards under the RAA which vested on 12 November 2005, and CISP are valued at the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and expensed over one year for the RAA, three years for the CISP.
88 The British Land Company PLC 9 Pensions The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme the scheme is the principal pension scheme in the Group.
It is a defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and not contracted out of SERPS.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company.
It is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
Existing entitlements will be retained by the members, with freedom to transfer to a new Defined Contribution Scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary and paid by the Company.
In certain circumstances it may be necessary to pay higher contributions when recruiting senior executives.
The Group has five other small pension schemes.
The total pension cost charged for the year was 12m 2005: 4m.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2003 and updated to 31 March 2004 and to 31 March 2005 and to 31 March 2006 by consulting actuaries, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow.
The employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 38.5% pa of basic salaries.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2006 2005 2004 2003 % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 4.9 5.3 5.5 5.5 Salary inflation 5.2 5.1 5.1 4.8 Pensions increase 3.0 2.9 2.9 2.5 Price inflation 3.0 2.9 2.9 2.6 The mortality rates adopted are from the medium cohort projection of the PA92 year-of-birth tables reduced by 25% to reflect the nature of the membership.
This means, for example, that members currently aged 60 are expected to draw their pension for 29 years males and 32 years females whereas members currently aged 45 who retire at age 60 are expected to draw their pension for 30 years males and 33 years females.
