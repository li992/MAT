Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
There is no inter-segment trading.
Management fees are in consideration of subsidiaries use of intellectual property and Group services including, but not limited to, business development services, purchasing, information technology, sales and marketing, finance and treasury, human resources and legal services.
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses.

The United Kingdom segment does not include the Groups non-trading head office and holding companies that are based in the UK.
These are shown as unallocated.

12 Goodwill m Cost At 1 January 2005 96.0 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 15.3 Exchange differences 10.8 At 31 December 2005 122.1 At 1 January 2006 122.1 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 104.0 Exchange differences 14.0 At 31 December 2006 212.1 Net book value At 1 January 2006 122.1 At 31 December 2006 212.1 Cash-generating units, comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying out impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of these cash-generating units.
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 115.0 118.8 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 1.8 2.2 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 7.3 1.1 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the United Kingdom business segment 88.0 212.1 122.1 Specific groups of cash-generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is significant are as follows: Goodwill Intangible assets 2006 2005 m m m m USA 108.8 108.8 114.7 UK 88.0 11.2 99.2 The recoverable amount of each of the groups of cash-generating units above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value of future cash flows attributable to the group.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of cash-generating units: future cash flows are based on budgets for 2007 approved by the Board.
Thereafter a prudent growth rate, not exceeding 3% has been applied to revenues for the first five years with 0% growth thereafter.
a terminal value is included in the assessment reflecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets.
a pre-tax discount rate has been applied to future cash flows for each group of cash-generating units, based on an underlying post-tax discount rate of 12%, grossed up by the applicable tax rate in each country.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to changes in the expected level of long term profitability and the discount rate applied to the future cash flows.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates is subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Forseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of a significant nature so as to result in a cash-generating units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
A fall of more than 12% in the future cash flows would be required to result in the carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Groups joint ventures.

The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at 31 October 2006 against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 12.

These amounts are blocked and not available for use by the business.
Non-cash changes comprise new finance leases, changes due to business acquisitions and movements between categories.
23 Financial instruments The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments are determined at Group level.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
Credit risk A diversified customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts minimizes the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
Cash assets, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Interest rate risk The Groups debt is held at variable interest rates because further early repayment of the debt is probable.
Finance leases are generally held at fixed interest rates.
Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis.
Foreign currency risk The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency.
The majority of the Groups net assets are in pounds sterling, US dollars and euros.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks.
At 31 December 2006 there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding 2005: none.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

It is estimated that a one percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pounds sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2006 2005: 0.3 million.
It is estimated that a one percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pounds sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2006 2005: 0.2 million.

Summary of methods and assumptions Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

On 13 March 2006, the Group signed a new five year 100 million revolving credit facility agreement.
On 19 April 2006 this was amended to include a 50 million four year term loan to help finance the acquisitions of the UK business.
Foreign currency exposure as at 31 December 2006 To mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas, the Group borrows, where appropriate, in the local currencies arising from its net investments.

In addition, no awards will be released unless the Companys TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date of grant.
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis.
As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments are currently anticipated: In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years.
As such it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations.
Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2009 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash flow performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.
As mentioned above, awards under the CIP in respect of the bonus paid for the year ended 31 December 2006 will be made subsequent to the publication of this report.
However, the maximum number of awards granted will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the time of grant and the monetary value will not exceed 50% of basic salary.
Full details of the levels of award and performance conditions will be disclosed in the Committees Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2007.
25 Acquisitions The principal acquisition in the year was that of the 58% interest in the Regus UK business not already owned.

b The valuation of property, plant and equipment was based on a market valuation approach, unless market values were not available in which case a depreciated replacement cost method was used.
c Leasehold interest valuations were based on the difference between contract rent and market rent over the lease term discounted to net present value at a weighted average cost of 12%.
The Groups 42% shareholding in the UK associate has been revalued in the course of accounting for the acquisition.
A revaluation of 10.0 million, representing 42% of the fair value adjustments of 23.7 million, has been applied to the Groups existing shareholding in the UK associate with a corresponding revaluation reserve of 10.0 million being created in equity.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reflects the anticipated future benefits Regus can obtain from operating the businesses more efficiently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding services.

31 Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculate an estimated fair value based on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where managements judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For significant business combinations management also obtain third party valuations to provide additional guidance over the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections, which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value.
Deferred tax assets We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast to make a profit in the forthcoming year.
Deferred tax assets are generally not recognised for the period in excess of 12 months from the year-end.
Onerous lease provisions We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous i. e. the Group does not expect to recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point.
The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate.
Dilapidations Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date of signing the lease.
The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exit the property so the Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date.
However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
Consequently provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments that can be measured with certainty at 31 December 2006.
