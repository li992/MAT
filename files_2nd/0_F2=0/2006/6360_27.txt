101 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued a Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The company has applied the optional transitional exemptions in FRS 20 Share-based payment and implemented its requirements for grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The fair value of share-based payments granted in the form of options is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes valuation technique, adjusted for future dividend receipts and for any market-related performance conditions.
The company grants share options over its own shares to the employees of subsidiary companies.
The company does not receive goods or services in exchange for these options.
These are accounted for as a written call option on the entitys own shares under FRS 25 and do not result in an accounting entry upon grant.
When the share options are subsequently exercised the resulting entries are either to increase share capital and share premium for new shares issued or to record a reduction in the treasury shares owned by the employee benefit trust.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are declared.
Dividends proposed but not declared are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Financial guarantees The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group.
The company treats such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Own shares held by employee benefit trusts Transactions of the group-sponsored employee benefit trusts are included in the parent company financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the company are debited directly to equity.

Fair values are determined by reference to market values, where available, or calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the company to cash flow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is detailed in note g. f Creditors 2006 2005 m m Amounts falling due within one year: Trade creditors 0.5 1.1 Amounts owed to group undertakings 493.6 736.4 Other taxation and social security costs 1.2 0.5 Other creditors 4.2 2.9 Accruals and deferred income 4.0 8.7 Derivative financial instruments at fair value 1.0 7.6 Total creditors amounts falling due within one year 504.5 757.2 Amounts falling due after more than one year: Derivative financial instruments at fair value 0.3 g Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date are presented below: Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 6.3 1.0 0.9 7.2 Interest rate swaps 2.3 0.7 0.4 0.4 8.6 1.7 1.3 7.6 Less: Non-current portion 1.4 0.3 Current portion 7.2 1.7 1.0 7.6 Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, based upon market prices where available or otherwise on discounted cash flow valuations.

The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company therefore hedges a substantial proportion of the groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts so as to hedge group translation risk not hedged by way of loans.
Gains and losses on such forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The notional value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2006 was 342.4m.
All these contracts had matured by 28 February 2007, at which point they were replaced with new forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note e exposes the company to cash flow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum period of five years.
At 31 December 2006 the nominal value of such contracts was 196.7m in respect of US dollar and 141.5m in respect of euro, their weighted average interest rate was 4.9% US dollar and 3.4% euro, and their weighted average period to maturity was three years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
For short-term transactions under one year, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agency.
For long-term transactions, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
h Provisions for liabilities and charges Onerous contracts m At 1 January 2006 5.1 Additional provisions in the year 0.1 Utilisation of provisions 1.4 At 31 December 2006 3.8 The onerous contracts provision comprises a provision against future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall and for long-term idle properties.
The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows relating to rent, rates, service charges and costs of marketing the properties.

The majority of the shares under option are attributable to employees of the company, however the company bears the full cost of share-based payment charges applicable to subsidiary undertakings.
Therefore all disclosures relevant to the company are presented within note 40 to the consolidated financial statements.
o Contingent liabilities To help secure cost effective finance facilities for its subsidiaries, the company issues guarantees to some of its finance providers.
At 31 December 2006 guarantees totalling 315.4m were in place in support of such facilities.
The company is included in a group registration for UK VAT purposes and is therefore jointly and severally liable for all other UK group companies unpaid debts in this connection.
The liability of the UK group registration at 31 December 2006 totalled 18.8m.
