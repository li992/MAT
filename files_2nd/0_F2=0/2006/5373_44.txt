The principal funds are three UK pension schemes, one dened contribution, two dened benefit.
The Group also operates a further dened benefit scheme in the Republic of Ireland and a French retirement indemnity plan.
In all cases, the assets of the schemes are held by independent custodians and are kept entirely separate from the assets of the Group.
No loans have been made by any scheme to any Group company and no shareholdings of the schemes have been used as security for any loans to any Group company.
i Dened contribution plan Flexiplan The pension charge for Flexiplan represents contributions due from the employer.
During the year it amounted to 4.6m 2005: 4.5m with 0.4m 2005: 0.3m outstanding at the year end.
ii Dened benefit plans The Group operates a number of dened benefit schemes for qualifying employees in the UK, Republic of Ireland and France, the largest scheme being the Emap Earnings Related Pension Plan EERPP in the UK.
Under the scheme rules, participants are entitled to retirement benets varying between 0% and 67% of final salary on the attainment of retirement age.
All schemes in the UK are closed to new participants.
In January 2006 the Group accelerated funding of 15m into the EERPP which, in addition to the accelerated funding already provided in the year of 4m 2005: 4m, fully funded the scheme on an IAS 19 Employee Benets basis at that time.
Since that date, a small deficit has re-emerged due to changes in actuarial assumptions about expected rates of return on the schemes assets.
Following the acquisition of SRH, the Group accelerated its funding to the largest acquired scheme and is currently considering further funding options.
The pension charge for the year for all schemes for continuing operations was 0.8m 2005: 1.1m and for discontinued was 0.3m 2005: 0.4m.
All calculations have been made by a qualied independent actuary updated to 31 March 2006.
The last full actuarial valuations for the Groups principal schemes were carried out at the following dates: EERPP 5 April 2003 SRH 1 October 2003 The next full actuarial valuations for the Groups UK schemes will be completed in the 2007 financial year, at which time all assumptions, including mortality assumptions, will be updated.
