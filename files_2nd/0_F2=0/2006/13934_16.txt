ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Notes to U.
NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED There are two new standards and one amendment to an existing standard which have effective dates after the the Accounts date of these financial statements, which are relevant to the Group but which have not yet been implemented continued by the Group: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, IFRS 8 Operating Segments and amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures.
These standards change disclosure requirements, but otherwise do not impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 will be implemented in 2007 and IFRS 8 in 2009.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Group makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
TESTING GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT The Group tests annually whether goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life have any impairment.
Details of the tests and the carrying value of the assets are shown in note 29.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows.
If actual cash flows are lower than estimated there is a risk that future impairments would be necessary.
PENSION LIABILITIES The present value of pension liabilities see note 11 depend on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of the pension liabilities.
C. INCOME TAX The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions for which the tax liability asset is uncertain.
The Group recognises asset liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the tax treatment.
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions.
RESULTS EXCLUDING EXCEPTIONALS Under the IFRS presentation, the share of profits of joint ventures associates is shown after interest, tax and minority interests on one line in the income statement.
In addition, turnover from joint ventures associates is excluded from revenue.
To provide a better understanding of the impact of joint ventures associates particularly given the significance of BBH the table below shows proforma revenue and profit figures excluding exceptionals but including the S&N share of the results of joint ventures associates on each line: 2006 2005 m m Revenue 4,155 3,926 Operating profit 535 479 Net finance costs 93 82 Net interest on pension liability 10 5 Profit before tax 452 392 Tax 100 87 Minorities 21 19 Attributable to ordinary shareholders 331 286 The revenue and profit figures excluding exceptionals of joint ventures associates included in the table above comprise: 2006 2005 m m Revenue 827 666 Operating profit 180 126 Net finance costs 18 14 Net interest on pension liability Profit before tax 162 112 Tax 45 28 Minorities 21 19 Attributable to ordinary shareholders 96 65 34 Financial Statements Scottish & Newcastle plc 2006 4.

PENSIONS The Group funds a number of pension schemes which are administered through independent trusts.
The main Group schemes are UK defined benefits schemes and are based on final salary pensions or career average pensions for employees starting before April 2003 and on career average pensions for employees starting on or after April 2003.
The principal assumptions used in valuing the schemes were: 2006 2005 % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.1 3.8 Rate of increase in pensions 2.9 2.6 Discount rate 5.2 4.9 Inflation rate 2.9 2.6 A review of the mortality experience of the main schemes pensioners was carried out in 2006.
The mortality assumptions at the year-end have been based on updated standard tables adjusted for scheme experience.
The updated tables resulted in an increase in assumed life expectancy and a corresponding increase in the schemes liabilities.

EMPLOYEE SHARE INCENTIVE PLANS Notes to During the year there were five classes of employee share incentive plans outstanding: i.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE.
Under the scheme participants enter into a savings contract the Accounts for a period of three or five years and options are granted, exercisable using the amount saved under the continued contract at the time it terminates.
Options under the scheme can be granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market price at the time of the grant and are not subject to performance conditions.
Options issued prior to 7 November 2002 are not expensed.
Executive Share Option Plan Options are granted at the market price at the date of grant normally exercisable between three and ten years after the date of grant.
Performance conditions are based on EPS performance.
Performance Share Plan PSP Conditional rights to acquire shares at the end of a retention period normally three years.
Performance conditions are based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the total return index of FTSE 100 companies measured over a three-year period.
Restricted Share Plan RSP Selected employees are given rights to acquire shares at the end of a retention period normally two or three years at a nil price.
Rights can only be exercised if the employee is still employed by the Group at the end of the retention period.
The cost of these benefits is not material and so is not included in the table below.
v. Share Incentive Plan Under the Share Incentive Plan, shares may be appropriated to participants up to a maximum initial market value in any tax year of 3,000.
These shares are held by the Trustees of the Plan and can be transferred tax free to participants after a period of five years.
If the employee is not employed by the Group at the end of three years the shares may be forfeited.
There is also a savings and matching element to the Plan: participants can contribute up to 1,500 per annum to buy shares and will receive a further two free shares from the Company for every three shares they buy.
The table below summarises outstanding options and rights which were issued after 7 November 2002: SAYE Executive Weighted Weighted average average Number exercise Number exercise of shares price of shares price 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m p p m m p p Outstanding at beginning of year 4 3 356 351 8 9 391 391 Granted 1 1 411 366 Exercised 2 378 Forfeited 2 353 1 391 Outstanding at end of year 3 4 374 356 6 8 393 391 Exercisable at end of year m 6 Weighted average share price at date of exercise 512 Range of exercise prices pence 340 340 359 359 -411 -366 -456 -456 Weighted average remaining contractual life years 2 2 6 7 PSP SIP Weighted Weighted average average Number exercise Number exercise of shares price of shares price 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m p p m m p p Outstanding at beginning of year 10 6 Granted 5 5 1 Exercised Forfeited 1 1 Outstanding at end of year 14 10 1 Exercisable at end of year m Range of exercise prices pence Nil Nil Nil Nil Weighted average remaining contractual life years 2 2 3 Financial Statements Scottish & Newcastle plc 2006 39 12.
EMPLOYEE SHARE INCENTIVE PLANS CONTINUED Notes to The fair value of the SAYE, PSP and RSP rights are estimated at the date of grant using a Black Scholes model.
The effect of expected early exercise has been incorporated into the model by using an expected life that is the Accounts shorter than the contractual life.
The main assumptions used during the year were: continued 2006 2005 Dividend yield % 3.8 4.5 Expected volatility % 18 17 Historic volatility % 18 17 Risk free interest rate % 4.5 4.5 Expected life of rights SAYE 3 3 PSP RSP 1-3 2-3 SIP 3 1 Historic volatility was based on the last 12 months.
The TSR performance requirements for the PSP were built into the model.
The cost of the Share Incentive Plan was based on the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
The charge against profits for equity-settled share based payment transactions was 7m 2005 5m.
The weighted average fair value at measurement date of options and rights issued during the year was 143p 2005 61p.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in the employee share trusts which have been treated as cancelled.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Notes to TREASURY POLICY AND STRUCTURE Treasury policies are reviewed annually by the Board and are managed by the Group Treasury Department the Accounts which provides a service to operating divisions.
continued The policies have as their key objective the management of financial risk through investment, borrowing and foreign exchange activities in relation only to the underlying business needs of the Group.
The Group Treasury Department reports formally on a monthly basis to a Treasury Committee under the chairmanship of the Group Finance Director and quarterly to the Board Committee on Treasury which includes two Non-Executive Directors.
It is subject to regular compliance audits by the Group Review and Audit Department and an annual review by the Groups external auditors.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mix of bank and capital market borrowings that provide sufficient resources to meet its financing requirements over the medium-term.
Net debt at the year-end is at a level with which we are comfortable.
The credit rating of the Group is currently BBB from Standard & Poors.
It is the Groups intent to strengthen its credit ratios to achieve a higher credit rating.
Borrowings and interest rate swaps The following table sets out the maturity profile for borrowings and interest rate swap liabilities.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Notes to Loans 2006 2005 the Accounts m Interest m Interest continued US Private Placement 2009-2015 US dollars fixed 565 4.8-5.6% 653 4.8-5.6% Floating unsecured loans 2008-2018 Sterling 10 80 Medium-term unsecured loans 2007-2012 Sterling fixed 126 5.6% 279 5.6% floating 10 Euros floating 208 215 Japanese yen fixed 22 0.2-0.9% floating 5 HK dollars floating 37 42 Czech crowns floating 8 5 Other loans Euros fixed 60 6.6% 64 6.6% floating 11 19 Total other loans 1,025 1,394 Bank loans 2007-2016 Sterling floating 141 Euros fixed 55 4.4-5.5% 70 4.4-5.5% floating 643 280 US dollars floating 6 43 Swiss francs floating 8 9 Total bank loans 712 543 Floating rate loans have underlying reference rates determined by the three-month benchmark rate for the appropriate currency e. g. Libor.
Certain of the Groups borrowings have normal financial covenants.
If these covenants were breached the borrowings would become payable immediately.
Borrowings of 8m 2005 11m are secured on property, plant and equipment.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups reported profits, net assets and gearing are all affected by movements in foreign exchange rates, particularly the Euro.
It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies for a range of forward periods, but not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
In addition, currency assets are hedged by way of currency borrowings where practicable to protect total equity.
The overall level of debt of the Group is not sufficient to allow the Group to fully hedge its Euro assets.
As a consequence of this, the Group has entered into a series of cross currency interest rate swaps for hedging the net investment in foreign operations, which effectively create 1.2bn of Euro borrowings offset by 0.8bn of Sterling deposits.
The net investment hedge for Euros at December 2006 was equivalent to 2.6bn.
At present, the Group effectively is a borrower of Euros.
Where debt has been issued in a currency other than Euros, cross currency interest rate swaps for hedging of the debt issuance back to Euros have been entered into.
The Group also has a significant investment in India which is hedged by Indian rupee currency swaps.
The Group also has exposure to assets denominated in Russian rouble as a result of the ownership of 50% of Baltic Beverages Holding BBH.
Modest levels of hedging have been undertaken by BBH.
Further hedging is continually kept under review.
Interest rate risk Interest rate exposure is managed within limits agreed by the Board which stipulate that borrowings, where the rate of interest is fixed for a period in excess of 12 months, should account for no less than 30% and no more than 70% of borrowings.
To achieve this the Group enters into fixed rate loans, interest rate swaps and other derivatives.
At December 2006 the fair value of these derivatives was 4 m and these will impact cash flows and profits up to 2014.
After taking account of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2006, 54% of net Euro borrowings were at rates fixed for periods in excess of 12 months and 46% were at variable rates.
The fixed rate borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% and a weighted average maturity rate of 3.3 years.
Credit risk Credit risk encompasses all forms of counterparty exposure.
Policy objectives in order of priority are security, liquidity and return.
Deposits and other counterparty exposures are only acceptable with financial institutions with an A1 shortterm rating or an A long-term rating for exposures beyond one year or with wholly owned subsidiaries of such institutions approved as acceptable by the Treasury Committee.
The maximum risk with any counterparty or counterparty group is 50m on an S&N Group basis with the exception of AAA Money Market Funds where the maximum risk can be 150m.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of trade receivables and trade loans, however, given the spread of the Groups customers, credit risk is believed to be limited.
Where practical, security is taken on property owned by trade loan counterparties.
Financial Statements Scottish & Newcastle plc 2006 47 25.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Notes to Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will have insufficient debt facilities to meet future obligations.
Policy the Accounts objectives with regards to liquidity are to ensure a suitable mix of bank and capital market facilities to meet continued two years planned debt requirements plus a contingency, and also for the average life of these facilities to have a minimum maturity of three years.

The Group has entered into interest rate swaps, with a notional amount of 580m, where the Group is paying a fixed rate of interest maturing between 2010 and 2014.
Under these swaps the bank has the option to terminate or vary the rate of interest on the swap.
The weighted average maturity as disclosed above assumes that these swaps run to final maturity.
The earliest date at which the bank can exercise their option is 2007.
In addition, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 200m where the Group is paying a capped rate of interest until 2009 and then a fixed rate until maturity in 2012.
Cash and deposits are placed on short-term maturities up to a maximum of three months at relevant market rates for the maturity concerned.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF BRANDS AND GOODWILL Notes to Goodwill and brand values have been allocated across cash generating units and the recoverable amounts of these units have been estimated and compared to the carrying amounts.
In all cases the recoverable amounts the Accounts were in excess of the carrying amounts.
continued The table below shows, for the units with material goodwill brand values, the key information used in the process.
The assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
These estimates take account of inter alia economic forecasts, S&N marketing plans, political factors and estimates of competitors strategy.
In all cases the recoverable amount was based on value in use.
The impairment review on France produced a recoverable amount that was in excess of the carrying value by 228m.
If the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced from 3.5% to 2.8% or if the discount rate assumption was increased from 7.9% to 8.4% the recoverable amount would be in line with the carrying value.
