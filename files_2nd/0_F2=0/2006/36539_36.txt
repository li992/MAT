Notes to the accounts continued 8.
TAx continued F. UK REIT STATUS continued To qualify as a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the group, the groups qualifying activity and its balance of business which are set out in the UK REIT legislation in the Finance Act 2006.
G. FRENCH SIIC STATUS Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the French properties with the exception of 9 place Vendme are within the SIIC tax exempt regime.
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc, which will then pay UK dividends to its shareholders.
Hammerson plc will be taxed in the UK on dividends received from France, subject to available UK tax losses.
If all the properties were realised at the 31 December 2006 values, a total of 324 million of dividends would arise 2005: 207 million, and deferred tax is provided for the potential UK tax thereon.
Dividend obligations will arise after property disposals but there will be a period of approximately four years after a sale before dividends are required to be received in the UK.
Under the SIIC qualifying conditions, Hammerson plc must continue to be listed in France and at least 80% of assets must be employed in property investment.
If the conditions are breached before 2014, the original conversion charge would be recalculated at full rates giving an additional 74 million tax cost.
H. COMMENTARy Unless tax exemptions apply, UK corporation tax and deferred tax is calculated at a rate of 30% 2005: 30% and foreign tax is calculated using appropriate local rates.
Current tax in the year, before the UK REIT entry charge, was reduced by the French tax exemption, capital allowances and tax relief for capitalised interest.
Current tax in the future should generally be low because of UK REIT and French SIIC status and carried forward UK tax losses.
The principal taxable property is 9 place Vendme.
