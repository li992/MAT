94 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 9 Net pension liability The Company participates in both a funded defined benefit scheme and funded defined contribution scheme.
The total pension charge in the profit and loss account for the UK defined contribution scheme was 0.1m 2005: nil.
With reference to the defined benefit scheme, the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, Kingfisher plc is one of a member of Group companies that participate in the scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities.
The valuation of the scheme used for FRS 17 has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the Groups UK scheme at 31 March 2004 and has been updated to 28 January 2006.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out at 28 January 2006, using the projected unit method of funding.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2006 2005 Annual percentage rate %% Discount rate 4.7 5.3 Salary escalation 4.3 4.3 Rate of pension increases 2.7 2.7 Price inflation 2.7 2.7 The assets in the scheme at 28 January 2006 and the expected future rates of return on them were: 2006 2005 2004 millions % millions % millions % Equities 18.6 7.6 15.3 7.8 17.0 8.0 Bonds 13.0 4.2 7.9 4.7 7.6 5.0 Property 2.8 5.9 2.4 6.2 1.0 6.5 Other principally cash 0.7 3.7 1.0 3.7 1.7 3.7 Total market value of assets 35.1 6.1 26.6 6.6 27.3 6.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 41.0 35.6 96.9 Deficit in the scheme 5.9 9.0 69.6 Related deferred tax asset 1.8 2.7 20.9 Net pension liability 4.1 6.3 48.7 The amounts recognised in the profit and loss account are as follows: millions 2006 2005 Amounts charged credited to operating profit Current service cost 0.9 1.1 Gain on settlements 63.4 Total operating charge credit 0.9 62.3 Amounts credited charged to other finance income Expected return on pension scheme assets 1.7 1.8 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 1.8 1.9 Net return 0.1 0.1 Total charged credited to profit and loss account 1.0 62.2 Movements in the scheme deficit on the balance sheet were as follows: millions 2006 2005 Deficit in scheme at start of year before tax 9.0 69.6 Current service cost 0.9 1.1 Employer contributions 5.3 1.2 Gain on settlements 63.4 Net return 0.1 0.1 Actuarial loss gain recognised in profit and loss reserve 1.2 2.8 Deficit in scheme at end of year before tax 5.9 9.0 The assets and liabilities in the scheme at 29 January 2005 no longer include those balances related to Kesa Electricals.
Under the terms of the Kesa Electricals demerger, the assets and liabilities associated with Kesa Electricals employees were transferred to a new Kesa Electricals scheme, those employees having ceased to participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme from 31 March 2004.
On 16 December 2004, the related settlement of these benefits was effected, giving rise to a payment by the Pension Scheme of 137.6m to the new Kesa Electricals scheme, and also giving rise to a settlement gain in the prior year of 63.4m as above.

The final dividend accrued for the year ended 29 January 2005 of 159.7m was reversed in the opening balance sheet as at 29 January 2005. b Share-based payment FRS 20 Share-based Payments requires that an expense for equity instruments granted is recognised in the income statement based on their fair value at the date of grant, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense, which is primarily in relation to employee option and performance share schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme.
Formerly, the income statement charge, if any, was based on the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the date of issue with a corresponding increase in accruals.
The Company elected to apply FRS 20 only to relevant share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002.
The impact of adopting the new policy on the year ended 29 January 2005 has been to reduce profit after tax by 1.4m.
The cumulative effect of this prior year adjustment on the balance sheet as at 30 January 2005 is an increase in deferred tax asset of 0.8m, a decrease in other creditors of 6.6m and an increase in profit and loss reserve of 7.4m.
c Pensions Under former UK GAAP, the Company applied the provisions of SSAP 24 which are significantly different to FRS 17.
Details of the new accounting policy can be found in note 1.
The Companys opening restated balance sheet at 1 February 2004 reflects the assets and liabilities of the Companys allocation of the Groups UK defined benefit scheme totalling a net liability after deferred taxation of 48.7m.
The incremental charge arising from the adoption of FRS 17 on the Companys profit and loss account in the year ended 29 January 2005 was 0.2m, being the total of 0.1m to operating profit and 0.1m to net financing charges.
The actuarial loss of 2.8m arising in the year ended 29 January 2005 has been recorded in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
The net pension deficit after deferred taxation under FRS 17 at 29 January 2005 was 6.3m.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 101 15 Adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 The adoption of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement with effect from 30 January 2005 results in a change in the Companys accounting policy for financial instruments.
The impact of these standards on the Companys opening balance sheet is shown below.
The principal impact of FRS 25 and FRS 26 on the Companys financial statements relates to the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Financial assets and financial liabilities that arise on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are held on the balance sheet at fair value with the changes in value reflected through the income statement.
The accounting treatment of derivatives related to the Company that qualifys for hedge accounting is explained below.
Fair value hedges The Company uses interest rate and cross-currency swaps to hedge the exposure to interest rates and currency movements of its issued debt.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26, derivative financial instruments held for hedging were accounted for using hedge accounting and were not recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
Under FRS 26, derivative financial instruments that meet the fair value hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value movements recognised in the income statement.
For an effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.
To the extent that the designated hedge relationship is fully effective, the amounts in the income statement offset each other.
As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated hedging relationship impacts the financing line in the income statement.
On the adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26, there is no material impact for the Company of other financial assets and liabilities that are not part of a designated hedge relationship.
The adjustments to the opening balance sheet at 30 January 2005 are as follows: Balance Effect of Restated sheet at adoption of balance 30 January FRS 25 and sheet at 2005 FRS 26 30 January millions 2005 Debtors Amounts falling due after more than one year 7.9 23.9 31.8 Creditors Amounts falling due within one year 3,512.3 10.4 3,522.7 Amounts falling due after more than one year 738.9 22.0 760.9 Impact on net assets 8.5 Profit and loss account 969.4 8.5 960.9 Impact on equity shareholders funds 8.5
