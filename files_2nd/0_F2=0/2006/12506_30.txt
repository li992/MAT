Confirmation of the CGUs carrying value is determined based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
Given that the products are closely related and share similar risks and rates of return, consistent Group discount rates are used for all CGUs.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
All projections are based on information approved by management in respect of the following five years cash flows.
Assumptions are based upon events in prior periods as adjusted for expected developments in the following year with reference to market conditions.
All turnover and costs are taken into account and an estimate of capital expenditure required to maintain these cash flows is also made.
As at 31 December 2006 the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows was 8.5% 2005: 7.75%.
Goodwill of 217.9m has arisen on the acquisition of Campbells.
This represents future sales growth as well as commercial and cost synergies to be achieved by the integration of administrative and marketing functions, savings due to increased scale, own label contracts and the providing of opportunities for category extension and new product launches.
There were no impairments resulting from the reviews performed in 2005 or 2006.
13.5m of goodwill attributable to Cauldron has been re-classified to other intangible assets see note 15, less 4.1m taken to deferred tax, and a further 0.3m has been taken to goodwill for final fair value adjustments to the opening balance sheet.
Goodwill for Marlow has increased by 0.6m as a result of the final fair value exercise.
