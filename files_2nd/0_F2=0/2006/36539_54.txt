LxB Holdings Limited is the parent company of a group involved in property investment and development.
The fair values of investment properties, intangible assets and deferred tax liabilities were determined by the Directors.
The goodwill arising on this acquisition is principally attributable to provisions made for deferred tax resulting from the difference between how deferred tax is calculated for accounting purposes and the way it is valued during purchase negotiations.
In the opinion of the Directors, the carrying amount of this goodwill cannot be justified by future cashflows and consequently it has been impaired.
The impairment has been included in the income statement see note 2.
