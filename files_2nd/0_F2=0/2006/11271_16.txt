The CGUs have been defined as the operating business to which the goodwill relates.
The carrying value of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2006 2005 m m Solway Foods 30.1 30.1 Fletchers 17.2 17.2 Green Isle 15.2 15.2 Park Cakes 2.9 2.9 65.4 65.4 The group tests for impairment of goodwill on a semi annual basis.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using the groups weighted average cost of capital.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The rate used to discount the forecast post-tax cash flows for all CGUs is the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.0% 2004 05: 6.6%.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows.

The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
20 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
21 Credit risk The groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trading investments.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful trade receivables, estimated by the groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The groups top five customers, all leading UK retailers, represent 77% of the groups turnover.
These customers have favourable credit ratings and consequently reduce the credit risk for the groups overall trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The amounts written off in respect of credit risk were less than 0.1m in both the current and the prior year.

The carrying amounts of short term borrowings approximate to book value.
At the year end the group had available 190.0m 2004 05: 180.0m of undrawn committed facilities on the revolving credit facility and 18.8m bank overdrafts 2004 05: 18.7m, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
62 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Northern Foods plc N040009 Report 27-88 13 6 06 1:48 pm Page 63 23 Financial liabilities borrowings continued Currency exposure The group operates primarily in the UK with a functional currency of sterling.
The functional currency of the overseas companies is euros, giving rise to foreign currency exposure.
The average and closing rates used in the accounts to translate euros to sterling were 1.466 1 and 1.433 1 respectively 2004 05: 1.467 1 and 1.457 1 respectively.
24 Financing Bank overdrafts All bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured and repayable on demand, and are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest rate on bank overdrafts is 1.0% above the Bank of England base rate.
Revolving credit facility 2010 The group entered into a new five year syndicated revolving credit facility of 460.0m in July 2005, replacing an existing facility of 450.0m.
At the year end the amounts due under the facility were 270.0m 2004 05: 270.0m.
The amount drawn down is repayable in periods of up to one year but is capable of being immediately refinanced as part of the committed revolving credit facility.
The rate of interest fluctuates in line with market rates.
Convertible subordinated bonds 2008 The convertible subordinated bonds 2008 were issued on 19 February 1993 in registered form in amounts of 1,000 or multiples thereof or in bearer form in denominations of 1,000 and 50,000 and, unless previously redeemed, purchased or converted, would be redeemed at their principal amount by 8 August 2008.
Interest was payable at the rate of 6.75% per annum on 8 February and 8 August in each year.
The bonds were originally convertible into ordinary shares of the company at 326p per ordinary share but, following the demerger of the Dairy business in March 1998, the conversion price was adjusted to 225p in accordance with the trust deed.
The company has had the option since 31 August 1998 to redeem the bonds in multiples of 10m at their principal price and on 31 January 2006 the convertible bonds were repaid in full.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between the liability component and an equity component.
The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a market rate of interest for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The residual amount, net of deferred tax, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, was classified as equity.
The value of the convertible bonds recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 2006 2005 m m Nominal value of convertible bonds issued, net of issue costs 88.8 88.8 Equity component 18.7 18.7 Liability component at the date of issue 70.1 70.1 Interest charged since issue date 95.0 88.1 Interest paid since issue date 79.5 74.4 Liability component at repayment date end of the period 85.6 83.8 Repayment of bonds 85.6 Liability component at end of the period 83.8 As part of the restructuring of the groups borrowing facilities, the convertible bonds were repaid in full on 31 January 2006 using the proceeds of the issue of the Senior guaranteed loan notes.
No bonds were converted prior to the repayment.
At the date of repayment the directors estimated the fair value of the liability component of the convertible bonds to be approximately 94.4m.
Whilst there was no adverse cash impact, a one off charge of 8.8m was taken to the income statement, calculated as follows: 2006 m Cash settlement of bonds 91.3 Bond liability at date of repayment 85.6 Transfer to equity reserve 3.1 One off restructuring item fair value loss on early redemption of convertible bonds 8.8 Northern Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 63 N040009 Report 27-88 13 6 06 1:48 pm Page 64 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financing continued Senior loan notes 2012-2017 During the year the company issued 142.7m of senior guaranteed loan notes into the US Private Placement debt market, raising 142.0m after issue costs.
Notes were issued in both US dollars USD $155.0m and pounds sterling 54.3m.
The notes are fixed rate and unsecured.
The proceeds of the issue were applied to repay the 6.75% convertible bonds and to reduce short term bank debt.
The issue, which was in five tranches, was as follows: Tranche Maturity Amount m Rate Series A December 2012 $35.0 5.63% Series B December 2015 $82.5 5.77% Series C December 2017 $37.5 5.87% Series D December 2012 28.5 5.47% Series E December 2015 25.8 5.47% All US dollar cash flows have been hedged using cross currency swaps.
Northern Foods will receive each 20 December and 20 June the bond interest payment dates fixed USD sufficient to fully cover interest due to holders of the USD denominated bonds, in exchange for payment of fixed pounds sterling on the same date.
The weighted average interest rate payable in pounds sterling by the company is approximately 5.5%.
Additionally, the swap contracts provide for an exchange of the principal amounts at maturity at the same rate of exchange as the initial principal was translated 1 USD 1.752.
Loan notes Loan notes due within one year total 0.2m 2004 05: 0.5m.
This comprises 0.2m 2004 05: 0.4m which bear interest at 1.0% below the base rate, and can be redeemed at amounts of 20,000 or multiples thereof at their nominal principal amount semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December each year.
Loan notes not previously redeemed will be redeemed at their nominal amount by 30 June 2008.
Other loan notes of nil 2004 05: 0.1m bear interest at 1.0% below the base rate and can be redeemed in amounts of 10,000 or multiples thereof at their nominal principal amount semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December each year.
Loan notes not previously redeemed were redeemed at their nominal amount by 30 June 2005.
25 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency interest rate swap The company has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps to provide a cash flow hedge against currency and interest rate movements on the $155.0m loan notes it issued during the year.
Swap contracts with nominal value of $155.0m 88.5m have fixed sterling interest payments at an average rate of 5.5% for periods up to 2017 and have fixed USD interest receipts at an average rate of 5.76%.
As at the year end, swaps had a negative fair value of 1.6m 2004 05: nil.
Other currency derivatives From time to time the group has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exchange rate exposure.
The instruments purchased are denominated in euro.
The total notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the group has committed is nil 2004 05: nil.
The fair value of the groups currency derivatives is estimated to be approximately nil 2004 05: nil.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to nil have been charged to the income statement in the year 2004 05: 1.0m.
64 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Northern Foods plc N040009 Report 27-88 13 6 06 1:48 pm Page 65 26 Analysis of net debt References to Net debt refer to the total borrowings of the group, including both short term and long term bank loans, bonds, loan notes and finance leases, after offsetting the cash and cash equivalents of the business and short term investments.
Net debt will also include the proportion of the fair value of the currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the groups dollar denominated loan notes.
The table below reconciles Net debt to the corresponding balance sheet captions: 2006 2005 m m Cash and cash equivalents 40.7 25.5 Trading investments 9.6 9.8 Short term bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes 1.4 7.8 Bank loans 270.0 270.0 Convertible subordinated bonds 2008 83.8 Senior loan notes 2012-2017 142.9 Add back: currency element of fair value of swaps hedging the groups dollar denominated loan notes 0.9 Net debt 363.1 326.3 Net debt Net debt is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with other similarly titled non-IFRS debt measures reported by other companies.
The group adopts this measure because it is used in calculating the banking covenants.
It is also the measure used for internal debt analysis.
The company believes that Net debt is a useful measure as it indicates the level of indebtedness after taking account of the financial assets within the business that could be utilised to pay down debt.
In addition, the Net debt balance provides an indication of the net borrowings on which the company is required to pay interest.

This will continue to be reviewed in the future.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
It was assumed that the employees would exercise the options after vesting date.
Performance conditions notes A No performance condition attached.
B Performance condition measured by reference to total shareholder return TSR.
The company met the performance condition by finishing above the median point against the comparator group of companies.
C Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The target requires that the real growth in earnings per share over the three year performance period is greater than 3% per annum compound.
The performance condition allows for re-testing after years four and five against the full period from the grant.
D Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The performance condition does not allow for re-testing.
E The LTIPs have two performance conditions: TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on how the TSR in relation to an ordinary share of Northern Foods over the relevant performance period compares with TSR in relation to the ordinary shares of the companies in the comparator group in the same period.
Where the TSR of Northern Foods over the performance period places it between the median and the top quartile, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight line basis, with 20% of the shares being received when Northern Foods is placed above median, and 50% being received where Northern Foods is placed in the top quartile.
Where Northern Foods growth in TSR places it below median, no shares will vest in relation to this element of the award.
Return on invested capital ROIC : 50% of the total award vests on achievement of a minimum growth in ROIC over the performance period.
Growth in ROIC over the period has to be 100 or more basis points.
The number of shares that each participant receives is calculated on a straight line basis, with 7.5% of the shares being received if Northern Foods achieves growth of 100 basis points and a maximum of 50% being received if the company achieves growth of 200 basis points.
Details of movements in share options during the year are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average Options exercise price Options exercise price 2006 2006 2005 2005 number number Outstanding at start of period 11,071,483 1.57 11,767,092 1.53 Granted during the period 2,059,231 1.53 2,313,123 1.70 Forfeited during the period 1,507,577 1.12 286,250 1.49 Exercised during the period 1,139,128 1.38 1,776,569 1.42 Expired during the period 1,677,672 1.60 945,913 1.66 Outstanding at end of period 8,806,337 1.58 11,071,483 1.57 Exercisable at end of period 8,806,337 1.58 11,071,483 1.57 Forfeiture arises when the employee leaves within the vesting period.
Expiration of share options occurs when the last date for exercise has passed and the option has not been exercised.
The range of exercise prices for share options exercised during the year was 128.0 pence to 169.7 pence.
The options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.85 years 2004 05: 8.03 years.
The group recognised total expenses of 0.2m 2004 05: 0.1m in the year relating to equity settled share based payment transactions.
33 Retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees, principally the Northern Foods Pension Scheme the Scheme and Northern Foods Pension Builder Pension Builder in the United Kingdom and the Green Isle Foods Group Retirement and Death Benefit Plan the Plan in the Republic of Ireland.
Under the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on pay and service.
The Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are funded schemes.
The assets of the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are held in trustee administered funds separate from the finances of the group.
On 22 March 2005 the company announced the closure of the Scheme to new entrants and withdrew its agreement to allow early retirement on an enhanced basis.
Pension Builder was introduced on 1 May 2005 and is available to all UK based employees.
Pension Builder is a defined benefit scheme based on the career average principle.
The most recent valuation of the Scheme and the present value of defined benefit obligations was carried out at 31 March 2006 by an independent qualified actuary, Hewitt, Bacon and Woodrow.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost was measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuation are detailed below.
The Schemes own maturity experience has been considered when assessing the present value of defined benefit obligations.

The method of accounting, assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes detailed above.
The main actuarial assumption is underlying medical cost inflation of 5.0% per year 2004 05: 5.0%.
If the assumed rate of underlying cost inflation increased by 1% per annum then the valuation of the liabilities is estimated to increase by approximately 0.5m.
If the underlying cost of inflation decreases by 1% per annum then the valuation of the liabilities is estimated to decrease by approximately 0.5m.

i. Non-current assets held for sale Under IFRS, assets and liabilities relating to businesses held for sale should be presented separately to other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and furthermore should not be offset.
Assets are reclassified to non-current assets held for sale and disclosed below current assets in the balance sheet and liabilities are reclassified to liabilities directly associated with non-current assets classified as held for sale and disclosed after non-current liabilities.
As at 4 April 2004 there were non-current assets classified as held for resale of 52.3m and liabilities directly associated with non-current assets classified as held for sale of 12.2m.
These balances related to business which were later disposed of.
