7 Share-based payments The Group has three share option schemes and three share award schemes.
The principal features of these schemes are as follows: Share option schemes 2004 Executive Share Option Plan Options granted under this scheme are principally made to Executive Directors and members of the Executive Management Team.
This scheme grants options that vest and become exercisable providing earnings per share targets over a three-year period are satisfied.
Vesting levels will vary based on earning per share levels achieved.
There is no retesting after the three-year performance period.
Options under the plan must be held for a minimum of three years from date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The prices at which options are granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan must not be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share nor less than the average of the middle market quotation of an ICI Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the three business days immediately preceding the date on which the option is granted.
For US participants the awards are made as Stock Appreciation Rights SARs denominated in American Depository Receipts ADRs.
1994 Share Option Scheme The last options granted under this scheme were in 2003.
Share options outstanding under the 1994 Share Option Scheme were granted subject to performance conditions over a three-year period, which are retested each year until the 10 year terms of the grants are reached.
Earnings per Share was used as the performance condition.
The prices at which options were granted under the scheme must not be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share nor less than the average of the middle market quotation of an ICI Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the five business days immediately preceding the date on which the option is offered.
Grants under the 1994 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan are made on the same terms as the 1994 Share Option Scheme.
For US participants the awards are made as SARs denominated in ADRs.
UK Savings-related Share Option Scheme UK Sharesave Under the UK Sharesave scheme, the price at which options were granted could not be less than the greater of the nominal value of an Ordinary Share, or 80% of the average market value of an Ordinary Share on the three business days preceding the day on which the offer of options was made.
The options may normally be exercised within a period of six months, after a vesting period of three or five years, depending on the length of the option period chosen by the employee.
The total purchase cost in respect of options granted under the UK Sharesave Scheme is deducted from salary over a period of three or five years at the choice of the employee, and vest subject to employees meeting minimum service requirements.
Grants are no longer made under this scheme.
The grants to non-US participants under both the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan have been referred to collectively in the following tables as Senior Staff and grants to US participants as SARP.

com Accounts 7 Share-based payments continued Share award plans Performance Growth Plan Awards under the Performance Growth Plan are made to Executive Directors and members of the Executive Management Team, and are described on page 50.
The Performance Growth Plan makes conditional awards of ICI shares or for US-based participants ADRs, and is linked to performance over a fixed three-year period.
Performance Share Plan The first award under this plan was made in the year ended 31 December 2004, to senior staff below the level of the Executive Management Team.
These awards are conditional on preset earnings per share targets over a three-year period.
Awards are delivered in ICI shares or for US-based participants, ADRs.
Restricted Share Plan Awards under the Restricted Share Plan are made to a small number of senior executives below the level of the Executive Management Team.
The length of retention period before awards vest is flexible, and may vest in annual tranches.
The scheme involves awards of ICI shares or, for US-based participants, ADRs, with the release being conditional upon achievement of certain conditions which vary by employee.
Share-based expense The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and has elected not to adopt the exemption to apply IFRS 2 only to awards made after 7 November 2002, instead a full retrospective approach has been followed on all grants not fully vested at the date of transition 1 January 2004 in order to maintain consistency across reporting periods.
At 31 December 2006, there was 6m of unrecognised compensation cost related to non-vested awards granted over a weighted average period of 22 months.
The Group recognised total expenses all of which related to equity settled share-based payments transactions of: 2006 2005 2004 m m m Expense 6 78 Fair value assumptions of share-based payments The fair value of all options and share awards granted is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the following weighted average assumptions: 2006 2005 2004 Share Share Share Share Share Share options awards options awards options awards Weighted average fair value 0.79 3.23 1.10 2.58 0.92 1.95 Weighted average share price 3.49 3.46 2.81 2.77 2.31 2.22 Weighted average exercise price 3.49 0.00 2.81 0.00 2.31 0.00 Dividend yield 2.1% 2.2% 2.5% 2.5% 3.0% 3.7% Expected volatility 31% 33% 54% 53% 55% 61% Expected life 4 years 3 years 4 years 3 years 4 years 3 years Risk-free interest rate 4.5% 4.4% 4.6% 4.7% 5.0% 4.5% The Group uses historical volatility figures as an input to the Black-Scholes valuation model.
For each new grant, the historical volatility is considered for a period in line with the expected life of the option or equity instrument granted.
The Group assumes an expected life of one year after vesting for options and for other equity instruments the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt yield curve in effect at the time of grant, for the expected life of the option.
Participants in the Groups share-based incentive schemes are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.
Therefore, dividends expected on the underlying shares during this period must be taken into account in determining the fair value of share options and other equity instruments granted.
The Group assumes that until each share-based incentive award vests, the dividends per share will follow the same pattern as for the previous two years.
The Group then considers whether any adjustments are required to the expected dividends based on knowledge of the Company.
A proportion of equity instruments awarded to members of the Executive Management Team is based on the TSR performance of the Company relative to a peer group.
This market-based performance condition is taken into account in determining the fair value of these awards.
It is assumed the market is efficient and hence all available information about the peer group performance is already reflected in its share price.
ICI therefore assumes that each company within the peer group has equal probabilities of attaining each ranking within the peer group.
Movements in the number of shares under option during 2006 comprised new options 2.2 million, options exercised 4.3 million, and options forfeited or expired 2.9 million.
The number of Ordinary Shares issued during the year, wholly in respect of the exercise of options, totalled 1.1 million 2005 0.4 million: 2004 0.03 million.
The weighted average subscription price of options outstanding at 31 December 2006 was 2.70.
The weighted average grant price is equal to the weighted average exercise price detailed in the tables above.
The weighted average share price for options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2006 for the Senior Staff, UK-Sharesave and SARP schemes was 3.86, 3.76, and $28.93 respectively.
