No deferred tax asset has been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the losses.
Other than disclosed above, no deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 24.2 million 2005: 42.9 million in respect of the deficit on its pension scheme.
The Directors believe that the deferred tax asset will be realised as the deficit is reduced over the coming years.
