Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 34 Explanation of transition to IFRS reporting a Transition to IFRS reporting As stated in Accounting policies of the group Basis of preparation, these are the groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the group has adopted certain optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies.
Subject to those exemptions, the accounting policies of the group have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2005, and an opening consolidated balance sheet at 1 July 2004 the groups date of transition to IFRS reporting.
The IFRS figures have been prepared in accordance with IFRS standards and interpretations as endorsed and adopted for use in the European Union.
In preparing the comparative information and the opening consolidated balance sheet, the group has adjusted amounts reported previously in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with its former basis of accounting under UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the groups financial performance and financial position is set out in the following tables and accompanying description of the IFRS adjustments.

Nature of IFRS adjustments The main adjustments from UK GAAP to IFRS are as follows: Employee benefits Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the group expensed the intrinsic value of equity settled share options granted, being the difference between the market value of the shares at the time of the award of an option and the exercise price of the option, to the income statement over the minimum life of the option.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based payment, equity settled share-based transactions with employees are required to be measured at the fair value of the option at the date of grant which forms the basis of the charge to the income statement over the vesting period.
The fair values of the grants have been calculated based on the binomial and Monte Carlo option pricing models.
The group adopted the transitional arrangements that allow companies to apply IFRS 2 retrospectively to all options granted but not fully vested at 30 June 2004 where the fair value has been previously disclosed.
For the year ended 30 June 2005 the additional charge, compared to UK GAAP, to the income statement was 14 million.
The deferred tax credit under IFRS 2 is calculated based on the difference between the market price at the balance sheet date and the option exercise price of the shares at the date of exercise.
The deferred tax charge is therefore not comparable with the operating profit charge.
The additional deferred tax credit for the year ended 30 June 2005 was 5 million and the deferred tax asset at 30 June 2005 was 8 million 1 July 2004 3 million.
Post employment benefits Diageos accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits under IFRS is substantially the same as that previously applied under UK GAAP.
There are however a number of minor differences that give a slight variation in the valuations of the assets and liabilities in the schemes.
These include the use of bid prices rather than mid-market prices to value the assets in the schemes, and a different actuarial method for valuing certain risk benefits death in service and ill health benefits representing the liabilities of the schemes.
In addition, under UK GAAP, the costs of administering the schemes were charged as service costs and included in operating profit.
Under IFRS, these costs are included in the expected rate of return assumption and, as a consequence, are included in other finance income charges in the income statement.
The overall impact on the income statement for the year ended 30 June 2005 was to reduce the operating profit charge by 8 million and increase other finance charges by 7 million.
The application of these differences increased the post employment deficit before taxation at 30 June 2005 by 71 million 1 July 2004 73 million.
The deferred tax asset at 30 June 2005 in respect of this increase in deficit was 19 million 1 July 2004 19 million.
Biological assets Under UK GAAP, Diageos vines and the grapes on the vines were measured at the historical cost of the vine less accumulated depreciation where appropriate.
Under IAS 41 Agriculture, Diageo recognises its biological assets, being its vines and grapes on the vines, at fair value.
Any changes in the fair value of such biological assets are recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of the vines included in biological assets were 14 million at 30 June 2005 1 July 2004 13 million, and the increases in inventory values for the grapes were 3 million at 30 June 2005 1 July 2004 6 million.
The deferred tax liability at 30 June 2005 in respect of agricultural activity was 6 million 1 July 2004 7 million.
The net effect on profit before taxation of the application of IAS 41, for the year ended 30 June 2005, was an additional charge to cost of sales of 1 million, and a credit to tax of 1 million.
Joint ventures Under IFRS, the legal and contractual power to control or significantly influence is the key consideration when determining whether an entity is a subsidiary, joint venture or associate.
Under UK GAAP, consideration was given to the control or significant influence actually exercised in practice when making this decision.
A review of investments concluded that the groups beer interests in Malaysia and Singapore, classified as subsidiaries under UK GAAP, should be classified as jointly controlled entities under IFRS.
As a consequence, these entities previously fully consolidated with a minority interest under UK GAAP are proportionately consolidated under IFRS.
This adjustment did not affect the retained profit of the group.
IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures defines a jointly controlled entity as an entity where all parties enter into a contractual arrangement that specifies joint control, by unanimous consent, of all strategic financial and operating decisions.
IFRS allows the group to adopt either proportionate consolidation or the equity method when consolidating jointly controlled entities.
Diageo has adopted proportionate consolidation as its group policy.
This has resulted in some group entities, previously equity accounted under UK GAAP, being proportionately consolidated under IFRS.
For all proportionately consolidated entities, the IFRS balance sheet includes only the groups share of the assets and liabilities of those entities.
Where an entity was previously fully consolidated under UK GAAP, the minority interest portion does not exist under IFRS.
The overall impact for the year ended 30 June 2005 was a reduction in sales of 41 million and operating profit of 8 million.
The groups net assets at 30 June 2005 were reduced by 26 million due to the change in minority interests 1 July 2004 24 million, but the equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company was not affected.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 123 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 34 Explanation of transition to IFRS reporting continued Foreign exchange The group has a number of inter-company funding arrangements.
Under UK GAAP and IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, exchange rate differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement unless the monetary item forms part of a net investment in a foreign entity.
IAS 21 is more prescriptive in determining which loans, including inter-company loans, may be designated as part of the groups net investment or as a net investment hedge.
This has resulted in a 8 million loss, under IFRS, for the year ended 30 June 2005 being transferred from reserves to other finance charges in the income statement.
This does not reflect an economic gain or loss for the group.
Income taxes Under IAS 12 Income taxes, deferred tax is recognised in respect of nearly all taxable temporary differences arising between the tax written down value of assets and liabilities and the book value.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was recognised on timing differences.
This has resulted in deferred tax being recognised under IFRS on certain temporary differences that would not have given rise to deferred tax under UK GAAP.
In addition to the new deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of share-based payments, post employment benefits and agriculture, the groups balance sheet includes an additional deferred tax asset representing the recognition of tax benefits of group reorganisations made in prior years 30 June 2005 820 million: 1 July 2004 1,084 million and deferred tax in respect of other intangible assets 30 June 2005 and 1 July 2004 63 million.
The deferred tax asset in respect of group reorganisations will be amortised through the income statement over the period that tax benefits are received.
In the year ended 30 June 2005, the deferred tax asset was reduced by amortisation of 142 million.
In addition, due to the reduction in overseas tax rates during the year ended 30 June 2005, the asset was further reduced by 118 million.
The total additional tax charge to the income statement in respect of group reorganisations was therefore 260 million.
Other deferred tax items charged to the income statement in the year ended 30 June 2005 amounted to 7 million.
Over a number of years, the group has made a number of acquisitions and consequently recognised brand and other intangibles on its balance sheet.
Some of these acquisitions were structured as an acquisition of a legal entity and therefore the brand intangible has no equivalent tax basis.
The group therefore recognised an incremental deferred tax liability at 30 June 2005 of 489 million 1 July 2004 438 million including 41 million in relation to the Ursus and Chalone acquisitions during the year ended 30 June 2005.
In accordance with IFRS1, the equivalent adjustment in respect of the deferred tax liability at the transition date was taken as an adjustment to retained earnings.
For the acquisitions made after the transition date, the adjustment was included as part of goodwill.
The deferred tax liabilities established on brands will only crystallise on any subsequent disposal or impairment of the brands in respect of which they have been established.
Other deferred tax adjustments at 30 June 2005, on compliance with IFRS, included: a reduction of the deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised profits on the intra-group transfer of inventories, producing an additional deferred tax liability of 1 million 1 July 2004 8 million asset : an additional deferred tax liability of 39 million in respect of rolled over capital gains on the disposal of property 1 July 2004 36 million and additional deferred tax liabilities of 36 million in respect of fair value adjustments on the Seagram acquisition 1 July 2004 39 million.
Under IAS 1 - Presentation of financial statements, the tax charge on the face of the income statement comprises the tax charge of the company, its subsidiaries and the share of any joint ventures that are proportionately consolidated.
The groups share of its associated undertakings tax charges are included as part of the share of associates profits rather than being part of the tax charge, as under UK GAAP.
For the year ended 30 June 2005, the groups share of its associates tax charges amounted to 62 million.
Other adjustments Intangible assets Prior to the transition date, goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business was amortised through the income statement over a maximum of 20 years.
IFRS requires that an impairment review of goodwill is carried out at the date of transition irrespective of whether an indicator exists that goodwill may be impaired.
As none of the goodwill was impaired at either 1 July 2004 or 30 June 2005, the UK GAAP amortisation of 3 million for the year ended 30 June 2005 was not charged to the income statement under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill acquired prior to 1 July 1998 was eliminated directly against reserves.
The gain or loss on the disposal of a previously acquired business reflected the amount of purchased goodwill attributable to that business.
As Diageo opted not to restate business combinations prior to the date of transition, the goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP was frozen and remains in reserves.
During the year ended 30 June 2005, the group disposed of 53.9 million shares in General Mills for which attributable goodwill of 247 million, previously written off to reserves, was recycled to the income statement and charged to the loss on disposal under UK GAAP.
This adjustment is not required under IFRS, with the result that a 221 million gain on disposal of the General Mills shares was reported in the IFRS income statement, instead of the 26 million loss reported under UK GAAP.
Dividends Under UK GAAP, the proposed dividends on ordinary shares, as recommended by the directors, were deducted from shareholders equity and shown as a liability in the balance sheet at the end of the period to which they related.
Under IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date, proposed dividends are not considered to be a liability until they are approved by the Diageo board for the interim dividend and by the shareholders at the annual general meeting for the final dividend.
Under IFRS, the amount of the final dividend 30 June 2005 530 million: 1 July 2004 513 million was removed from current liabilities.
Leases The group has applied the requirements of IAS 17 Leases to all of its leases and has reclassified certain leases from operating to finance leases.
The amount of property, plant and equipment and finance lease obligations added to the balance sheet was 9 million at 30 June 2005 1 July 2004 12 million.
There was a 1 million increase in finance charges in the year.
Revaluation reserve The group last revalued its land and buildings in 1992 Guinness and 1988 GrandMet.
At 30 June 2005 there was a difference of 111 million 1 July 2004 113 million between the revalued net book value of property, plant and equipment and the historical net book value.
Under IFRS, it was determined not to recognise any revaluations and, as a consequence, the revaluation reserve was eliminated against property, plant and equipment.
Mot Hennessy The operations of Mot Hennessy are conducted through a partnership and a limited company in which Diageo has 34% interests.
Mot Hennessy restated its financial statements for the impacts of IFRS and Diageo adjusted some of these restatements to ensure consistency with its own IFRS group accounting policies.
The groups share of associates profits for the year ended 30 June 2005 increased by 3 million, and the groups share of net assets of Mot Hennessy at 30 June 2005 increased by 6 million 1 July 2004 3 million, primarily due to the reversal of goodwill amortisation IFRS 3 Business combinations, the fair value of harvested produce IAS 41 Agriculture and pension charges IAS 19 Employee benefits.
Exchanges Under UK GAAP, the group recognised revenue of 27 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 on the exchange of surplus maturing whisky inventories with other UK distillers.
IFRS does not permit the recognition of revenue on the exchange of similar assets, therefore this revenue, together with an equal and opposite cost of sales amount, is no longer recognised.
This adjustment does not impact on the operating profit of the group.
Reclassifications A number of items have been reclassified in the income statement and balance sheet to comply with IFRS presentation.
These include: Format of the income statement UK GAAP and IFRS permit costs in the income statement to be classified either by function expenses allocated to cost of sales, marketing or other operating expenses or by nature expenses analysed between purchases of materials, advertising costs, staff costs and depreciation.
Under UK GAAP, Diageo reported costs in the income statement and accompanying notes by nature but, under IFRS, costs are reported on the face of the income statement by function.
Discontinued operations Where discontinued operations represent a major line of business or geographical area of operations, IFRS requires their results to be presented in the income statement separately from continuing operations.
In the income statement for the year ended 30 June 2005, provision releases of 73 million for Burger King 53 million in respect of sale of businesses and Pillsbury 20 million in respect of taxation were reclassified to discontinued operations from profit before taxation and from taxation, respectively.
Deferred tax As a result of the IFRS adjustments to deferred tax, certain net deferred tax asset and liability positions under UK GAAP switched under IFRS.
Consequently, at 30 June 2005, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet were both reduced by 546 million 1 July 2004 520 million.
Post employment benefit liabilities Deferred tax balances in respect of post employment benefit assets and liabilities are no longer netted off against those post employment benefit balances, but are classified together with other deferred tax balances.
At 30 June 2005, this resulted in reclassification of 325 million to deferred tax assets 1 July 2004 298 million and 4 million to deferred tax liabilities 1 July 2004 4 million.
In addition, on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, post employment benefit assets and liabilities must be disclosed within non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively.
Under UK GAAP, post employment benefit assets and liabilities are disclosed as separate items after the other net assets.
Consequently, at 30 June 2005, 12 million was reclassified from benefit liabilities to assets 1 July 2004 11 million.
Associates Under UK GAAP, the groups share of associated undertakings operating profit, exceptional items, interest and tax were disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement.
IFRS requires these items to be disclosed as a single line in the income statement.
For the year ended 30 June 2005, this reclassification decreased the interest charge by 1 million and the tax charge by 62 million compared with UK GAAP.
Capitalised software Computer software which is not an integral part of a related item of hardware is required under IFRS to be reclassified from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
The amounts reclassified were 79 million at 30 June 2005 1 July 2004 60 million.
Cash and cash equivalents IFRS replaces the consolidated balance sheet term cash at bank and liquid resources with cash and cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents are defined as short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
This resulted in a transfer at 30 June 2005 of 28 million 1 July 2004 9 million from cash at bank and liquid resources to trade and other receivables and a transfer at 1 July 2004 of 412 million from cash at bank and liquid resources to other investments.
Provisions IFRS requires all liabilities to be analysed between amounts due within one year and due after one year.
At 30 June 2005, this resulted in a transfer of 88 million 1 July 2004 138 million from provisions for liabilities and charges under UK GAAP to provisions in current liabilities under IFRS.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 125 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.......................................................................... 34 Explanation of transition to IFRS reporting continued Explanation of material adjustments to the consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 30 June 2005 Bank overdrafts of 58 million that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management were classified as financing cash flows under previous UK GAAP but are reclassified as cash and cash equivalents under IFRS.
There are differences between the presentation of cash flow statements under IFRS and UK GAAP.
UK GAAP required the separate presentation of cash flows under eight categories whereas IFRS requires the separate presentation of three categories of cash flows.
Under UK GAAP, cash flow statements presented the movement in cash in the period whereas, under IFRS, cash flow statements present the movement in cash and cash equivalents.
b Adoption of IAS39 The comparative information presented for the year ended 30 June 2005 does not comply with IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation and disclosure and IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures.
Financial instruments for the year ended 30 June 2005 and as at 30 June 2005 have been recognised and presented in accordance with previous UK GAAP accounting policies.
In accordance with the exemption available in IFRS 1, the group has adopted IAS 39 with effect from 1 July 2005, the principal impact of this standard being to change the carrying value of financial instruments in the groups financial statements.
The impact of adoption of IAS 39 on the balance sheet at 1 July 2005 date of adoption is set out in the following table: 30 June Impact of 1 July 30 June 2005 IAS 39 2005 2006 million million million million Non-current assets Investments in associates 1,261 6 1,255 1,341 Other investments 719 148 867 69 Other financial assets 32 152 184 42 Deferred tax assets 778 10 788 1,113 Other non-current assets 6,398 6,398 6,525 9,188 304 9,492 9,090 Current assets 4,733 4,733 4,837 Total assets 13,921 304 14,225 13,927 Non-current liabilities Borrowings 3,677 67 3,744 4,001 Other financial liabilities 9 69 78 78 Other non-current liabilities 2,003 2,003 1,832 5,689 136 5,825 5,911 Current liabilities 3,606 4 3,610 3,335 Total liabilities 9,295 140 9,435 9,246 Net assets 4,626 164 4,790 4,681 Equity Called up share capital and share premium 2,220 2,220 2,223 Other reserves 3,181 123 3,304 3,168 Retained deficit 942 41 901 889 Equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company 4,459 164 4,623 4,502 Minority interests 167 167 179 Total equity 4,626 164 4,790 4,681 126 | Diageo Annual Report 2006
