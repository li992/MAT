Under the terms of an agreement entered into between Ian Carlisle and certain of the vendors of Highway Emergency Services Limited the vendors, Mr Carlisle expects to receive a payment of approximately 2.1m in January 2007: this sum represents a proportion of the deferred consideration received by the vendors under the terms of the 2002 agreement relating to the acquisition of that company.
Insurance Contracts The Group, through its subsidiary Affinity Partners Limited, enters into contracts of reinsurance with an independent insurance company that underwrites the policies marketed and administered by Homeserve GB Limited.
Under these arrangements, Affinity Partners Limited underwrites 50% of the risk and reward associated with these policies the policies.
The policies are entered into between the customers of Homeserve GB Limited and an independent insurance company in the United Kingdom only.
The policies are principally in relation to underwritten cover for a broad range of domestic emergencies relating to Plumbing and Drains, Electrical Wiring, Water and Gas Supply pipes and Gas Boilers.
Revenue from the reinsurance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies typically 12 months, reflecting the period of benefit to the customer.
Where the reinsurance premium is received in advance an appropriate amount is included within deferred income.
The costs associated with the claims received under the contract of reinsurance are recognised as they are incurred.
An assessment is made of whether the expected cash inflows under the reinsurance contracts are sufficient to meet the expected future claims costs under the reinsurance contracts.
If a shortfall were to arise, this would be charged immediately to the income statement.
The amounts recognised by the Group in respect of reinsurance contracts are as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Revenue 34,916 27,267 Claims costs 34,761 25,455 Deferred income 9,225 7,757 The principal impact on the amount of claims incurred under the reinsurance contracts relate to weather conditions, which can impact the frequency of claims and the nature of the emergency.
In order to assist in managing the risk arising from the policies, the claims costs are fixed for each type of emergency repair.
There is no concentration of insurance risk due to the immaterial size of each of the policies.
Neither the policies or the reinsurance contract are exposed to any significant liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, nor are there any exposures relating to embedded derivatives.
As the policies relate to emergency repairs and generally cover a 12 month period, all cash outflows are expected to occur within 12 months from the date of commencement of the policies.
On a weighted average basis, across all policies, a 1 percentage point increase in claims frequencies would result in additional claims costs of 0.9m.
