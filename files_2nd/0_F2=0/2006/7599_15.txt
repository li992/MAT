EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilutive potential Ordinary shares are those options where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average Earnings average Earnings number of per number of per Ordinary Ordinary Ordinary Ordinary Earnings shares share Earnings shares share m millions pence m millions pence Profit attributable to shareholders of the parent and for basic EPS 48.4 128.9 37.6 24.4 115.3 21.2 Effect of dilutive shares Options 6.4 5.7 Long term incentive plans 0.5 0.3 Diluted EPS Adjusted earnings 48.4 135.8 35.7 24.4 121.3 20.2 58 2006 annual report & accounts Notes to the Financial Statements continued 12.

The Group also has a US$10.0m interest rate swap that pays fixed and receives floating interest rates, maturing in January 2008.
At 31 December 2006 this swap was paying 4.2% and receiving 5.6%.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Currency derivatives The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and average rate options to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows.
The instruments are denominated in the functional currencies of the operations whose transactions are being protected for currency risk.
Although these contracts act as an economic hedge they are not designated as hedged for hedge accounting purposes.
Gains or losses are consequently taken directly to the income statement.
At 31 December 2006, the total amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is 69.4m 2005 85.1m.
At 31 December 2006, the net fair value gain of the Groups currency derivatives, including embedded derivatives, is 0.5m 2005 1.0m loss.
These values are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date, comprising 0.7m 2005 0.1m assets included in trade and other receivables and 0.2m 2005 1.1m liabilities included in trade and other payables.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to a 1.7m profit 2005 0.3m loss have been recognised in the income statement during the year.
Interest rate swaps and caps The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its principal bank and other borrowings.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swaps and caps contracts at 31 December 2006 was 79.5m 2005 103.6m.
Swap contracts with nominal values of 35.7m 2005 40.7m have fixed interest receipts at an average rate of 7.047% 2005 7.047% and floating interest payments at an average rate of 6 month LIBOR plus 2.857% 2005 6 month LIBOR plus 2.857% up to 2012.
At 31 December 2006 the fixed interest receivable rates vary from 6.61% to 7.375% 2005 2.75% to 7.375% and floating interest payable rates vary from 8.2% to 8.7% 2005 6.31% to 6.80%.
A further swap contract, with a nominal value at 31 December 2006 of 5.1m 2005 5.8m has fixed interest payments of 4.2% and floating interest receipts of 5.63% until 2008.
Cap contracts with nominal values of 38.7m 2005 57.1m have interest rates capped at the average rate of 3.94% 2005 3.67%.
On maturity of one of the cap contracts the counterparty has the option to enter into an interest rate swap for four years for a notional US$30m at 4.2% if the four year interest rate swap rate is below 4.2%.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The net fair value loss on interest rate swaps and caps outstanding at 31 December 2006 is 1.1m 2005 0.8m.
These values are based on the market value of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The gross fair value gain of 0.5m 2005 0.6m is included in trade and other receivables and the gross fair value loss 1.6m 2005 1.4m is included in trade and other payables.
Fixed to floating interest rate swaps are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges.
The movement in the fair value of these contracts is dealt with in the income statement.
Correspondingly, the borrowings that are hedged by these swaps are measured at fair value and the consequent movement in fair value is dealt with in the income statement and set-off against the movement in the fair value of these swaps.
Floating to fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are not designated as qualifying hedges.
These instruments are measured at fair value and the movement is correspondingly dealt with in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging interest rate swaps and caps amounting to a 0.3m gain 2005 0.2m have been recognised in the income statement during the year.
Commodity Derivatives The Group uses oil and gas price futures to hedge its exposure to oil and gas price movements and electricity price futures to hedge its exposure to certain electricity prices in Canada.
The fair value of these instruments at 31 December is set out in the table below.
The change in the fair value of oil and gas price derivatives amounting to a 1.8m profit 2005 2.3m loss has been recognised in the income statement during the year.
The electricity price futures are designated in a cash flow hedging relationship and the effective portion of the fair value gain of 0.6m 2005 nil during the year has been recognised in equity.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Hedge of net investments in foreign entity The Group has both US dollar and CAD dollar denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the USA and Canada.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of the US dollar borrowings was 53.2m 2005 55.1m and of the CAD dollar borrowings was 33.7m 2005 59.9m.

The fair values of all other financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the present value of their anticipated future cash flows discounted at a rate relevant to the nature of the financial instrument.
The fair values of non-sterling denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year end exchange rate.
Exchange rate risk of financial instruments Financial instruments that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations expose the Group to a currency risk.
Exchange differences arising on financial instruments that are not designated as quasi-equity or as a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation must be recognised in the Groups income statement when they arise.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement in the following year: At 31 December 2006 Currency of denomination US Canadian Other Sterling dollars dollars Euro currencies Total m m m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling 22.5 6.1 5.2 0.2 11.0 US dollars 0.2 0.2 Canadian dollars 5.0 5.0 Euro 0.1 0.5 0.6 Other currencies 0.7 0.5 0.1 1.1 0.8 27.5 6.1 5.3 0.2 16.7 At 31 December 2005 Currency of denomination US Canadian Other Sterling dollars dollars Euro currencies Total m m m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling 12.4 6.9 0.3 0.1 5.9 US dollars Canadian dollars 5.2 5.2 Euro 0.3 0.7 1.0 Other currencies 0.1 3.8 0.1 4.0 0.2 20.7 6.9 0.4 0.1 14.1 2006 annual report & accounts 73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27.

The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that 4.2m of the provision will be utilised in 2007, 1.6m in 2008 and the remaining balance of 7.4m utilised from 2009 onwards.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a rate of 6.0% pa, for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning & remediation obligations relate to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment.
The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
It is expected to be utilised over the next 45 years.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS Pensions The Group has adopted the revisions to IAS 19 which were published in December 2004.
As permitted by the revised standard, actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the period in which they occur through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Within the UK, the Group operates a funded defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the defined benefit plan was closed to new UK employees who are now offered membership of the defined contribution plan.
The majority of employees are members of one of these arrangements.
Pensions arrangements are also in place for most overseas employees, principally in the form of money purchase plans.
Valuations of the defined benefit plans are produced and updated annually to 31 December by independent qualified actuaries.

This reflects the different durations of those liabilities.
b The assumptions vary by scheme location for the overseas plans.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality table used for the main arrangements implies that a 65 year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 20.9 years 2005 20.8 years.
Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with inflation.

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long term return on the major asset classes equities, bonds and other weighted by the actual allocation of assets at the measurement date.
Other information A triennial actuarial valuation of the Groups UK defined benefit plan was made at 5 April 2005 and updated to 31 December 2006.
Under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with IAS 19, the cost as a percentage of covered payroll will tend to increase as the average age of membership increases.
The defined contribution section of the UK Scheme held assets, equal to its liabilities, of 0.6m as at 31 December 2006.
