The latest full actuarial valuation of the schemes was carried out at July 2004 and updated to 30th June 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the UK scheme were:- 30th June 2006 30th June 2005 30th June 2004 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.5% 3.7% 4.0% Rate of increase in pension payments 3.0% 2.5% 2.8% Discount rate 5.3% 5.0% 5.8% Inflation rate 3.0% 2.7% 3.0% Expected return on equities 8.5% 8.5% 8.5% Expected return on cash 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Expected return on bonds 5.0% 4.7% 5.4% Retirement age 64 65 65 The assets and liabilities in the schemes were:- 30th June 30th June 30th June 2006 2005 2004 000 000 000 Market value of assets: Equities 70,836 52,450 39,400 Bonds and cash 1,377 1,350 1,110 72,213 53,800 40,510 Actuarial value of liabilities 91,051 74,500 52,340 Deficit in the schemes 18,838 20,700 11,830 Deferred tax thereon 5,451 5,870 3,440 The history of experience gains and losses is:- Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 30th June 30th June 30th June 30th June 30th June 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets amount 000 6,492 4,600 2,550 4,110 7,370 percentage of scheme assets 9% 9% 6% 14% 5% Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities amount 000 180 1,120 - 270 180 percentage of present value of scheme liabilities - 2% - 1% 1% Total amount recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense amount 000 147 9,370 240 6,680 8,590 percentage of present value of scheme liabilities - 13% - 16% 25% Annual Report 4 8 06 08:50 Page 40 40 NOTES: continued 16.
Employee benefits continued At the date of the latest full actuarial valuation 30th June 2004, the market value of the assets of the UK scheme was 39,349,000 including AVCs of 1,410,000 and money purchase transfers-in of 1,266,000 and this value of the assets was sufficient to cover 65% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The movements in the schemes assets and liabilities were:- Year ended 30th June 2006 Assets Liabilities Total 000 000 000 Balance at 1st July 53,800 74,500 20,700 Contributions paid 6,269 - 6,269 Current service cost - 5,008 5,008 Expected return on pension schemes assets 4,606 - 4,606 Interest on pension schemes liabilities - 3,858 3,858 Actuarial loss 7,538 7,685 147 Balance at 30th June 72,213 91,051 18,838 Year ended 30th June 2005 Assets Liabilities Total 000 000 000 Balance at 1st July 40,510 52,340 11,830 Contributions paid 4,170 - 4,170 Current service cost - 3,980 3,980 Expected return on pension schemes assets 3,510 - 3,510 Interest on pension schemes liabilities - 3,200 3,200 Actuarial loss 5,610 14,980 9,370 Balance at 30th June 53,800 74,500 20,700 The expense recognised in the Consolidated income statement was:- 2006 2005 000 000 Current service cost 5,008 3,980 Expected return on pension schemes assets 4,606 3,510 Interest on pension schemes liabilities 3,858 3,200 4,260 3,670 The expected return on pension schemes assets and the interest on pension schemes liabilities are recognised within financial income and financial expenses respectively.
The current service cost is recognised within cost of sales, distribution costs and administrative expenses.
Provisions Warranty provision 2006 2005 000 000 Movements during the year were: 632 546 Balance at the beginning of the year 584 485 Utilised during the year 745 571 Created in the year 161 86 793 632 Balance at the end of the year The warranty provision has been calculated on the basis of historical return-in-warranty information and internal quality reports.
It is expected that most of this expenditure will be incurred in the next financial year and all expenditure will be incurred within three years of the balance sheet date.
Other payables 2006 2005 Balances at the end of the year were: 000 000 Payroll taxes and social security 3,741 3,066 Other creditors and accruals 6,498 5,392 10,239 8,458 19.
Foreign currency holdings and borrowings An analysis by currency of Group cash at the year end is as follows:- 2006 2005 Currency 000 000 Pounds Sterling 69,228 66,208 US Dollar 13,982 11,253 Japanese Yen 11,334 10,605 Euro 13,768 13,642 Other 584 636 30,728 30,072 The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturities of the deposits and borrowings, all of which are less than one year.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid.
Net assets and associated borrowings The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were: Currency Net assets of Currency Base borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate 000 000 % US Dollar 17,060 17,250 5.25% Japanese Yen 12,396 12,430 0.25% Euro 18,236 18,325 2.75% The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, shortterm currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
Operating leases The total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases all of which relate to land and buildings in subsidiary companies were: 2006 2005 000 000 Expiring within one year 341 381 Expiring between two and five years 129 237 470 618 Annual Report 4 8 06 08:50 Page 42 42 NOTES: continued 21.

Acquisition of subsidiary During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of itp GmbH, a company based in Germany.
The provisional fair values of the assets acquired were: Book Value Adjustments Fair value 000 000 000 Tangible fixed assets 527 - 527 Intangible fixed assets 183 183 - Inventories 90 - 90 Debtors and prepayments 374 - 374 Creditors 296 - 296 Cash 469 - 469 1,347 183 1,164 Identified intangible assets acquired 1,869 Goodwill 1,811 Consideration paid 4,844 Intangible assets acquired comprised the outstanding order book, customer list, patents, knowhow, trademarks and other intellectual property.

Explanation of transition to IFRS EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002 requires that the consolidated financial statements of the Company, for the year ended 30th June 2006 and from thereafter, be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Special purpose consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS for the opening Consolidated balance sheet at 30th June 2004 and for the 2005 Consolidated income statement and Consolidated balance sheet, which have been used for the comparative figures in this Annual report.
These special purpose financial statements were issued to the London Stock Exchange on 14th October 2005.
The major impacts of IFRS on income for the year ended 30th June 2005 and on the balance sheet at 30th June 2005 were: Capitalisation of development costs IFRS requires certain development expenditure to be capitalised and subsequently amortised over a period of time.
This has resulted in an increase in profit before tax of 0.5m for the year and an intangible asset of 4.8m at 30th June 2005.
Earnings per share increased from 34.3p to 34.9p.
Dividends Under IFRS, dividends are only accounted for once they have been approved by shareholders.
The 2005 final dividend is therefore not accounted for in the 2005 results and equity at 30th June 2005 is thereby increased by 10.0m.
Treatment of exchange differences Under IFRS, exchange gains and losses resulting from the hedging of future foreign currency cash inflows are reflected in revenue, whereas under previous UK GAAP, these were shown within administrative expenses.
This has increased revenue and administrative expenses by 0.7m, although the profit before tax is unchanged.
Balance sheet reclassifications IFRS requires a number of assets and liabilities to be presented differently.
The most significant are: The pension deficit is shown at the gross value, with a related deferred tax asset shown as part of non-current assets.
Previously, the pension deficit was shown net of the deferred tax amount.
Software licences, previously part of tangible fixed assets, have been reclassified as intangible fixed assets.
The deferred tax balance has been analysed between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and these balances are shown separately under assets and liabilities.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued a Tangible assets Tangible assets have been reduced by the transfer of software licences to a separate heading.
The adjustment is purely one of reallocation as follows: 000 At 30th June 2004 Cost of software licences transferred 4,904 Accumulated amortisation of software licences transferred 2,851 Net book value of software licences transferred 2,053 At 30th June 2005 Cost of software licences transferred 5,929 Accumulated amortisation of software licences transferred 3,526 Net book value of software licences transferred 2,403 b Intangible assets Development costs, previously written off as incurred under UK GAAP, have been capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 and are then written off over 5 years.
Also, certain items of tangible fixed assets have been reallocated to intangible assets, as noted in a above.
At 30th June 2004 000 Development costs capitalised 4,206 Net book value of software licences transferred note a 2,053 Net book value of total intangible assets at 30th June 2004 6,259 At 30th June 2005 Net book value of development costs at 1st July 2004 4,206 Additional development costs capitalised during the year 1,959 Amortisation of development costs charged during the year 1,376 Net book value of development costs at 30th June 2005 4,789 Net book value of software licences transferred note a 2,403 Net book value of total intangible assets at 30th June 2005 7,192 c Deferred tax Deferred tax adjustments are as follows: 000 At 30th June 2004 Deferred tax balance at 30th June 2004 as reported under UK GAAP 3,760 Adjustments: Provision for capitalised development costs 1,262 Adjustment for tax rate on intragroup trading 372 Adjustment for holiday pay accrual 190 Deferred tax on pension schemes deficit 3,440 Deferred tax provision under IFRS 1,020 Analysed as: Deferred tax asset 6,967 Deferred tax liability 7,987 1,020 Annual Report 4 8 06 08:50 Page 47 47 26.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued c Deferred tax continued 000 000 At 30th June 2005 Deferred tax balance at 30th June 2005 as reported under UK GAAP 4,522 Adjustments: Provision for capitalised development costs - brought forward 1,262 - current year movement 175 1,437 Adjustment for tax rate on intragroup trading - brought forward 372 - current year movement 128 500 Deferred tax on pension schemes deficit - brought forward 3,440 - current year movement 2,430 5,870 Adjustment for holiday pay accrual 190 Deferred tax under IFRS 601 Analysed as: Deferred tax asset 10,556 Deferred tax liability 9,955 601 The adjustment for tax rate on intragroup trading is in respect of the elimination of profits in intragroup trading held in the year-end inventory.
Under UK GAAP, the tax effect was calculated based on the tax rate of the selling group company, whereas under IFRS, the tax effect uses the tax rates applying in the purchasing group companies.
d Current tax debtor The adjustment for current tax debtor represents a reallocation from current liabilities, for amounts previously netted under current tax liabilities.
e Currency translation reserve Currency exchange differences, previously accounted for within retained profit and loss account reserve, are now accounted for in a separate reserve.
Only exchange differences from 1st July 2004 are included, as exchange differences prior to 1st July 2004 are covered by the IFRS 1 exemption.
f Retained reserves Retained reserves have been adjusted under IFRS as follows: 000 000 At 30th June 2004 Retained reserves at 30th June 2004 as reported under UK GAAP 93,110 Capitalised development costs 4,206 Deferred tax thereon 1,262 2,944 Holiday pay accrual note g 620 Deferred tax thereon 190 430 2004 final proposed dividend accounted for when approved 9,019 Deferred tax provision on intragroup trading 372 Retained reserves under IFRS at 30th June 2004 105,015 Annual Report 4 8 06 08:50 Page 48 48 NOTES: continued 26.

This accrual is in respect of holidays earned by employees, not yet taken.
In accordance with IFRS, the final dividend is accounted for only when it has been approved by shareholders.
Therefore, 9,019,000 is excluded from other payables at 30th June 2004 and 9,972,000 at 30th June 2005.
