d Basis of calculating capital requirements for Life & Pensions business Each Life and Pensions company has to hold sufficient capital to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
For the FPLP With-Profits Fund, the capital requirement is the risk capital margin RCM which amounts to 220m 2005: 276m.
This is calculated on set criteria of adverse scenarios laid down by the FSA the market risk scenarios tested are what would happen if property prices fall by 12.5%, equity prices fall by 20%, corporate bonds spreads increase by 5.23%, fixed interest yields rise 0.81% and persistency increases by 32.5%.
The RCM is based on the asset mix at the year-end and takes into account hedging strategies and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse market conditions.
Under the realistic capital methodology, the capital requirement is the higher of the twin peaks test of the realistic peak and the regulatory peak.
In FPLP With-Profits Fund, the realistic peak applied in both 2006 and 2005.
This has resulted in a With-Profits Insurance Capital Component WPICC of 866m 2005: 639m required to bring the regulatory peak of 1,475m 2005: 599m in line with the realistic peak of nil 2005: 40 m. Regulatory reserving rule changes arising from the adoption of PS 06 14 allow the value of future transfers to be deducted from the WPICC for 2006: this has resulted in a surplus in the FPLP With-Profits Fund, on a regulatory basis, of 609m.

For UK non-participating funds, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency margin determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
For overseas business, local regulatory capital requirements are determined and these amount to 33m 2005: 29m.
