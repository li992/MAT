The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2004 and has been updated to 31 March 2006 by a qualied independent actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The deficit on the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Ltd, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
As allowed by FRS 17, the deficit has not been allocated between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Ltd as it is not possible to do so on a consistent and reasonable basis.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc part of it.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the liabilities of the scheme were: 2006 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate 4.90% 5.40% 5.40% 5.50% Rate of increase in salaries 3.90% 3.90% 4.65% 4.25% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.90% 2.90% 2.90% 2.50% Inflation assumption 2.90% 2.90% 2.90% 2.50% The expected long term rates of return on the scheme assets as at 31 March were: 2006 2005 2004 2003 Equities 7.05% 6.95% 7.00% 6.75% Corporate bonds 4.15% 4.65% 4.65% 4.75% Government bonds 3.55% 3.95% 4.00% 3.75% Cash 3.75% 4.00% 3.25% 3.00% Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 53
