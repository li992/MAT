NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Parent company accounting policies Accounting basis The parent company financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed below, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses are not presented in these financial statements.
The Tate & Lyle PLC consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 contain a consolidated statement of cash flows.
Consequently the Company has taken the exemption available in FRS1 Revised 1996 Cash flow statements, and has not presented its own cash flow statement.
Changes in accounting policies The Company has adopted the following new standards in the year ended 31 March 2006: FRS1 Retirement Benefits: FRS20 Share-based Payment early adopted : FRS21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date: FRS23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: FRS25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation: FRS26 Financial Instruments: Measurement and FRS28 Corresponding Amounts.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly except where the exemption from restating comparatives has been taken.
Details of the effect of prior year adjustments are shown in note 14.
Intangible fixed assets Patents and other intellectual property are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Where the assets are acquired as part of a business combination, historical cost is based on their fair values as at the date of the combination.
Amortisation of the assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, not exceeding 20 years.
Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets over the estimated useful life.
The tangible fixed assets comprise plant and machinery which is depreciated over a period of 3 to 28 years.
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Investments Fixed asset investments are included in the balance sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to profit as incurred.
Research and development All expenditure on research and development is charged to profit as incurred.
Retirement benefits The Company contributes to the Group pension plan operated in the UK.
Details of the plan are included within Note 28 of the Group financial statements.
As permitted under FRS17 Retirement Benefits, the plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan, as the employer cannot identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan.
The employers contributions relate to the current service period only.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on a full provision basis on timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts and their recognition for tax purposes that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences or on timing differences arising on unremitted profits of overseas subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to permit tax relief of the underlying timing differences.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the last day of the financial period the closing rate and other profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, for options granted with non-market vesting conditions, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
