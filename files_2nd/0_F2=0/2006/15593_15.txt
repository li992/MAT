FRS 20 Share-based payment: The Company operates a range of share-based incentive schemes both awards of options and awards of shares and has applied the requirements of FRS 20 for the first time in these financial statements.
Under FRS 20, an expense is recognised in the Profit and loss account for all share-based payments calculated based on the fair value at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
Compliance with FRS 20 increased reserves by 94m at 29 February 2004.
FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date: This standard sets out amended requirements for accounting for events after the Balance Sheet date.
Following the introduction of this standard, dividends are only recognised at the Balance Sheet date if they are declared before that date.
The final dividend for 2003 04 was declared in April 2004, therefore the dividend charge recognised in the Profit and loss account and the dividend creditor recognised in the Balance Sheet have been reversed.
This resulted in an increase in reserves of 365m at 29 February 2004.
Due to similar treatment of the 2004 05 dividend, reserves at 26 February 2005 have increased by 410m.
FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation: FRS 25 supersedes FRS 13 and substantially amends FRS 4 Capital instruments.
This standard is effective for the Company from 27 February 2005.
However, as the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the IFRS equivalent standard IAS 32, the parent Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements.
FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement: FRS 26 applies to all listed entities for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and prescribes new accounting rules relating to financial instruments and hedge accounting.
This standard has been adopted in full in these financial statements and the requirement applied prospectively from 27 February 2006.
The deferred tax adjustments on the implementation of the above named standards results in a 24m adjustment to reserves at 27 February 2005 2004 nil.
