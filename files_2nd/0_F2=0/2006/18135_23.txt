NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2006 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED 4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued b Principal assumptions for managements estimation of fair value of investment properties If information on current or recent prices for assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow approach to investment properties are not available, the fair values of investment properties are determined using discounted cash flow valuation techniques.
The Group uses assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The principal assumptions underlying managements estimation of fair value are those related to: the receipt of contractual rentals: expected future market rentals: void periods: maintenance requirements: and appropriate discount rates.
These valuations are regularly compared to actual market yield data, and accrual transactions by the Group and those reported by the market.
The expected future market rentals are determined on the basis of current market rentals for similar properties in the same location and condition.
c Income Taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in different jurisdictions.
Significant estimates are required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which determination is made.
4.2 Critical judgements in applying the entitys accounting policies a Distinction between investment properties and owner-occupied properties The Group determines whether a property qualifies as investment property.
In making its judgement, the Group considers whether the property generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by an entity.
Owner-occupied properties generate cash flows that are attributable not only to property but also to other assets used in the production or supply process.
b Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets The Group follows the guidance of IAS 39 revised 2004 on determining when an investment is  impaired.
This determination requires significant judgement.
In making this judgement, the Group evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost: and the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow.
