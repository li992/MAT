Financial risk As disclosed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group adopts a prudent approach to the management of financial risk, with a view to minimising where practicable its exposure to market, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.
As a stand alone entity the Company would be subject to significant liquidity risk since its assets primarily consist of investments in subsidiaries.
However, since the Group is managed on a unied basis and is subject to minimal liquidity risk, the Company may, as required, draw on liquid resources from elsewhere within the Group.
The Company is not subject to market, credit or interest rate risks.
The Companys financial assets comprise outstanding amounts due in respect of the exercise of share options these amounts are not interest bearing.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise balances owed to other Group companies these balances are not interest bearing and are repayable on demand.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value.
