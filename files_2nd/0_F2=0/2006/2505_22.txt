British EnErgy group plc 85 Annual report and Accounts 2005 06 parent Company Financial statements notes to the Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 1.
Accounting Policies i Basis of Preparation the financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
the Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united Kingdom and are therefore being presented separately from the consolidated financial statements of the British Energy group, which have been prepared under international Financial reporting standards as adopted by the European union iFrs.
references to British Energy or the Company are to British Energy group plc, the ultimate holding company of the British Energy group.
references to the group are to the Company and its subsidiaries.
these financial statements cover the financial year from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006, with comparative figures for the financial period from incorporation on 2 July 2004 to 31 March 2005. in preparing the financial statements for the current year, the Company has adopted Frs 20 share-based payment Frs 20, Frs 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation Frs 25 and Frs 26 Financial instruments: Measurement Frs 26. the change in accounting policy relating to share-based payments under Frs 20 has resulted in no revisions to the financial statements in the prior period, however, in the current year investments in subsidiaries have increased by 3m and retained earnings have increased by 3m to recognise share options granted by the Company.
Frs 25 supersedes Frs 13 Derivatives and other Financial instruments: Disclosure and substantially amends Frs 4 Capital instruments.
the standard is effective from 1 January 2005. however, as consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the iFrs equivalent standard iAs 32 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, the Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of Frs 25.
Frs 26 applies to all listed entities for the periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and prescribes new accounting rules relating to financial instruments and hedge accounting.
this standard has been adopted in full in these financial statements and the requirement applied prospectively from 1 April 2005. neither the adoption of Frs 25 or Frs 26 has required any revisions to the financial statements in the year ended 31 March 2006, nor the prior period.
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally Accepted Accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results can differ from those estimates.
in accordance with Frs 18 Accounting policies the Directors have reviewed the Companys accounting policies and confirm that they are the most appropriate.
A number of the policies require the Company to use a variety of estimation techniques.
significant factors considered when assessing the carrying value of assets include future electricity prices, expected annual output, expected station operating costs, remaining station lives and discount rates.
the Company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting a profit and loss account, statement of total recognised gains and losses and cash flow statement.
Accordingly neither a profit and loss account, statement of total recognised gains and losses, nor a cash flow statement is presented in these financial statements.
ii Fixed Asset Investments investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at the cost of shares allotted.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
the carrying value of all fixed asset investments is regularly assessed for permanent impairment and provision made, if appropriate.
iii Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is more likely than not that the assets will be realised.
iv Share-based Payment adopted from 1 April 2005 the Company has four share compensation schemes, the Long term Deferred Bonus plan, the share incentive plan, the interim Bonus plan and the Executive share option plan 2004. the Company accounts for its share compensation schemes in accordance with Frs 20. the Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees of its subsidiaries under the terms of the Companys various employee share compensation schemes.
the fair value of the share compensation schemes is recognised in investments with the corresponding credit included in shareholders equity.
