v Between 6 April 2002 and 5 April 2003, Mr Dighton received a salary supplement of 30% of base salary in excess of the earnings cap in lieu of pension provision in respect of his base salary in excess of the cap.
Following the Governments announcement of proposed changes to the tax rules for pensions, these payments were suspended with effect from 6 April 2003, pending a review of Mr Dightons pension arrangement.

The ULSRB is money-purchase in nature and was consolidated with Mr Dightons benefits from the Securicor Group Pension Scheme under the transitional arrangements following 6 April 2006.
A sum of 229,568 was paid to the Securicor Group Pension Scheme in respect of Mr Dightons ULSRB in April 2006. vi Mr Gibson receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 40% of his basic salary with effect from 6 April 2006.
