Notes to the financial statements of parent company for the year ended 31 December 2006 Financial statements of parent company 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts of The Laird Group PLC have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with UK accounting principles including applicable accounting standards.
The financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about the Group.
Profit and loss As permitted by the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives, principally as follows: Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Pensions The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to the operating profit or loss in the year.
The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service and gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments are also charged to the operating profit or loss in the year.
The expected return on the assets of the schemes during the year based on the market value of scheme assets at the start of the year and the expected increase in liabilities of the schemes are included within other finance charges income.
Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses in the year together with differences from changes in assumptions.
The deficit on defined benefit pension schemes, net of deferred tax, is reported on the balance sheet as the pension liability.
The accounts include pension schemes where the parent company is the principle employer.
The Company has adopted the amendment to FRS 17 Retirement Benefits that permits companies to replace the existing disclosure requirements of FRS 17 with those of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax subject to the following: a Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date.
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not recognised.
b Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
c Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, inclusive of any transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss account.
The Laird Group PLC 91 Notes to the financial statements of parent company continued for the year ended 31 December 2006 1.
Accounting policies continued Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
From 1 January 2005, such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken in the profit and loss account.
Share based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the expense recognised in the Company profit and loss account relates to equity settled grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market company performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For grants that ultimately do not vest charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.
Tangible assets The fixed assets of the Company were acquired at a cost of 0.7m 2005, 0.7m and have accumulated depreciation of 0.4m 2005, 0.5m charged against them.

Pension schemes The Company operates three defined benefit schemes.
Approximately 60 2005, 60 employees are members of these defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,600 2005, 1,600 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year was 3.0m 2005, 5.9m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2006 at their market value is estimated at 72.0m 2005, 66.8m and the liabilities estimated at 81.5m 2005, 81.6m.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is 9.5m 2005, 14.8m.
Since last year equity markets have risen and coupled with the increase in corporate bond yields which has reduced the value of discounted liabilities, this has resulted in a reduced net pension liability.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension liability under FRS 17 at 31 December were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Annuities 10.3 10.2 Equities 41.0 36.5 Gilts and bonds 20.7 14.6 Other including cash 5.5 Total market value of assets 72.0 66.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 81.5 81.6 Deficit in the schemes 9.5 14.8 There are minor variations in the assumptions used by the different actuaries employed to value the separate schemes.
The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.8% per annum 2005, 4.4% and those for equities at 7.8% per annum 2005, 8.0%.
The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates of return from the main asset classes.
For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in the markets for these assets has been assumed.
For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities.
The mortality assumption used at the year end is based on 92 series tables with an allowance for improvements in line with the medium cohort based on each members year of birth.
For IAS 19 the schemes liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 3.0% per annum 2005, 2.75%, salary increases of 4.0% per annum 2005, 3.75% and a discount rate for liabilities of 5.1% per annum 2005, 4.75%.

Share based payments The Directors remuneration report on pages 34 and 35, sets out the general terms and conditions including vesting requirements for all share based payment schemes: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Schemes.
All share based payments are equity settled.
An expense of 1.6m was recognised in the year 2005, 1.6m before employers national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIPs shares awarded and the share options granted.
The schemes were amended to take account of the Rights Issue in 2006.
The number of shares outstanding at the date of the Rights Issue were increased by a factor of 1.0605 and the exercise price of any options was adjusted by a factor of 0.9429.
These factors were calculated using 464p, being the closing price on the date of 16 March 2006.
Any historic figures in the tables that follow have been adjusted where necessary by these factors.
The following table shows the number of LTIP awards, in issue at the beginning of the year, and those granted during the year.
2006 2005 Number Number Granted in 2003 513,289 513,289 Granted in 2004 455,703 455,703 Granted in 2005 533,441 Outstanding as at 1 January 1,502,433 968,992 Granted during the year 602,900 533,441 Lapsed during the year 608,105 Vested and exercised during the year 257,706 Outstanding as at 31 December 1,239,522 1,502,433 Of the 1,239,522 shares outstanding at 31 December 2006, 255,583 had vested but had not been exercised.
Share based payments continued The following table shows the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movements in share options issued under the 1994 Share Option Scheme.
The balance of the share options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and do not result in a charge against profits in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 20.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 383p 2005, 353p.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2006, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 4.0 years 2005, 4.3 years.
The following table shows the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movements in share options issued under the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan.
Share based payments continued All options in the table above were recognised in accordance with FRS 20 as noted above.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 380p 2005, 345p.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2006, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 7.6 years 2005, 8.3 years.
149,532 options 2005, 202,532 in the price range 132p to 236p, 504,282 options 2005, 596,653 in the price range 237p to 323p and 334,000 options 2005, nil in the price range 324p to 458p are subject to the higher performance targets set out in the table on page 35 of the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIPs shares were awarded including the market based performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
The non-market company performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of LTIP awards during the year was 317p 2005, 184p and of share options granted during the year was 119p 2005, 102p.
The following table lists the inputs to the valuation models for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006.

The expected volatility of the LTIP shares is based on historical volatility: average of monthly activity over the last three years.
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on the LTIP shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value.
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.
Auditors remuneration The Company paid 25,000 2005, 25,000 to its auditors in respect of the audit of the financial statements of the Company.
Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP and its associates for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts of The Laird Group PLC because group financial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
