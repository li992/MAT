Key Assumptions and Estimates Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the Balance The resulting estimates will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual Sheet at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or results.
The Board has considered the critical accounting estimates and loss is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group assumptions used in the Accounts and concluded that the main area of designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a significant risk which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying recognised asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is in respect transaction or of a rm commitment cash ow hedge.

Full details of the assumptions used to the Group did not hold any fair value hedges.
calculate the pension assets and liabilities may be found in Note 33.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges and that are highly effective, are recognised in equity.
Where the forecasted transaction or rm commitment results in the recognition of an asset for example, property, plant and equipment or of a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Otherwise, amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement and classied as revenue or expense in the same periods during which the hedged rm commitments or forecasted transaction affects the Income Statement for example, when the forecasted sale takes place.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the committed or forecasted transaction ultimately is recognised in the Income Statement.
When a committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specic assets and liabilities or to specic rm commitments or forecast transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows or hedged items.
Fair Value Estimation The fair value of publicly traded derivatives and trading and available-forsale securities is based on quoted market prices at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
In assessing the fair value of non-traded derivatives and other financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each Balance Sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the specic or similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as option pricing models and estimated discounted value of future cash ows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.

In 2006, the total pension costs amounted to 5.5m and so, there being no difference between the total pension costs year on year, no adjustment has been made to the underlying operating profit in 2005.
Severance costs relate principally to reductions in operational staff at Leith, Dundee and Tilbury.
The severance costs in the year ended 31st December 2005 related principally to reductions in operational staff at Grangemouth and Tilbury.
The asset impairment cost arose on the closure of the Imperial Grain Silo at Leith.
The write off of the shed occurred at Tilbury where it was necessary to demolish a storage shed to make space for a new Cemex facility.
The repair costs in 2005 were incurred as a result of one of the Groups tugs requiring substantial repairs following a grounding incident.
Part of these costs were recovered through the Groups insurance policies.
There was no tax effect from this item as the company involved was subject to tonnage tax at that time.
The training costs were incurred in training new operational staff at Grangemouth.
The training costs in 2005 were incurred in training new operational staff prior to the opening of the new paper handling facility at Tilbury.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees under a SAYE share option scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the LTIP schemes.
One-off costs charged against operating profit and increases in fair value of investment properties do not relate to the profitability of the Group on an on-going basis.
Underlying earnings per share excludes such items and the tax thereon from the profit for the year attributable to shareholders, with the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year as per the calculation for basic earnings per share.

The valuations were incorporated into the accounts at 31st December 2006 with the resulting increase in fair value of 24.1m being taken to the Income Statement.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of investment property.
The Groups investment properties were valued at 31st October 2005 by Bidwells, as Independent Valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS and the International Valuation Standards IVS1.
The valuation of each investment property was on the basis of Market Value, subject to the assumption that the investment properties would be sold subject to any existing leases.
The Market Value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
Bidwells has assumed that each Port will continue to be operational and has made the special assumption that all investment properties are free from contamination and that any spillages or contamination will be removed by the tenant prior to the termination of the lease.
In accordance with the Valuation Standards, Bidwells confirms that, although it has carried out the valuation of the assets since 1991, it has not provided other property advice.
In relation to the rms preceding year the total fees paid by the Company as a percentage of the rms total fee income was less than 5%.
Bidwells maintains a policy of rotating valuers in accordance with Practice Statement 5.2.

Retirement benefit schemes In the past, the Group operated two pension schemes that covered the vast majority of employees: these schemes were merged during 2006.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
At the start of the year, the schemes that the Group had established were as follows: Forth Ports PLC Pension Scheme Port of Tilbury London Limited Pension Fund These schemes were of the dened benefit type, providing benets that are linked to pay near retirement.
The assets of the schemes were held in separate funds that were administered by trustees.
These funds were held separately from the Company assets.
The pension cost relating to these schemes was assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualied actuary.
The latest formal actuarial assessments of the schemes were as at 5th April 2005.
The actuaries have provided updated gures for the scheme as at 31st December 2006.
The two schemes were merged from 1st July 2006.
The assets and liabilities of the Tilbury Fund were transferred to the Forth Ports Scheme, which was renamed The Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions which are listed below.
The total pension cost was 5.3m 2005 5.3m.
Member contributions are paid in addition.
A number of employees are members of The Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme FRDW scheme.
The Group also has a contractual relationship with self-employed pilots who operate within the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay to provide pilotage services.
The self-employed pilots make payments into the Pilots National Pension Fund PNPF.
The FRDW scheme is a multi-employer dened benefit scheme which was set up many years ago on a national basis to provide pensions to Registered Dock Workers.
The most recent valuation of the FRDW scheme was carried out in 2005 which recorded a small surplus.
On an ongoing basis, it was fully funded.
The total assets and liabilities of the FRDW scheme are not assigned to specic employers.
All new employees joining the Group are entitled to join the Forth Ports scheme now known as the Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme : unless they are former Registered Dock Workers, they would not be entitled to join the FRDW scheme.
On the basis that the FRDW scheme is fully funded, the Group does not believe that it has any exposure to this pension scheme.
The employers are not entitled to participate in any surplus arising in the FRDW scheme.
The contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a dened contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.2m 2005 0.2m.
The Company and Port of Dundee Limited PODL are the Competent Harbour Authorities in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay respectively where they are responsible for the provision of pilotage services.
The pilotage services are provided by self-employed pilots.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio and an allowance made for expected expenses.
This gave an assumed rate of 5.97% net of expenses at 31st December 2006.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31st December 2006 was 13.2m 2005 20.5m.
