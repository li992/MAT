Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Basis of preparation and first time adoption of IFRS a Basis of preparation The Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 are the Groups first annual accounts to be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The date of transition to IFRS is deemed to be 1 April 2004 and the results for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been restated accordingly, except for changes relating to IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which have been adopted prospectively from 1 April 2005.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Financial Statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the fair value of certain financial instruments and in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Under IFRS the Group will maintain the columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement.
This will enable the Group to continue its practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting profit for the year before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
This is the profit measure used in the adjusted EPS calculation and is considered to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Groups underlying cash earnings.
Profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items is reconciled to profit before taxation on the face of the income statement.
Items which are of a material and non-recurring nature have been disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups results.
These items are shown as exceptional items on the face of the income statement.
The Group has reclassified assets arising from development expenditure as intangible with effect from 1 April 2004.
Previously such assets had been included within property, plant and equipment.
The consolidated balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been restated to present intangible assets arising from development expenditure separately from property, plant and equipment.
As a consequence, intangible assets arising from development expenditure have increased by 15.7m, with property, plant and equipment decreasing by a corresponding amount.
The amortisation of assets arising from development expenditure remains in the income statement within the column before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
There was no effect on the net assets of the Group or on the profit before taxation for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation represent goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets on business combinations since 1 April 2004.
The amortisation and any impairment is included in the income statement within the column amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation.
b Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated Financial Statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates accounted for under the equity method.
An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its operating and financial policies.
An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control of its operating and financial policies.
An entity is regarded as an associate if the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Details of the Groups principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are given in note 35.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated, whereby the Groups income statement and balance sheet include the Groups share of the income and assets on a line by line basis.
Associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups income statement includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
The accounts of certain subsidiaries incorporated outside the United Kingdom are drawn up initially to conform with local regulations and adjusted subsequently to comply with IFRS and United Kingdom company law.
The Company has taken advantage of section 230 the Companies Act 1985 not to present its own income statement.
c First-time adoption of IFRS Transitional arrangements for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS1 Firsttime Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and allow companies adopting IFRS for the first time to apply certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the year of transition.
The Group has applied the following key exemptions: IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Group has adopted IAS32 and IAS39 prospectively from 1 April 2005 and has not presented comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2005.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, financial instruments continue to be valued using the accounting principles adopted in the Groups UK GAAP annual report for that year.
A reconciliation of the adjustments required on adoption of IAS39 is given in note 36.
Annual Report 2006 ICAP plc 57 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Basis of preparation and first time adoption of IFRS continued IFRS3 Business Combinations The Group has accounted for all acquisitions since 1 April 2004 in accordance with IFRS3 and has applied the requirements of IAS36 Impairment of Assets and IAS38 Intangible Assets since that date.
Acquisitions and mergers prior to 31 March 2004 have not been restated and are included in the results at their book value as at 1 April 2004.
No impairments were required as at 1 April 2004 under IAS36.
IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Exchange differences on the retranslation of the balance sheets of subsidiaries at the balance sheet date are deemed to be nil as at the date of adoption of IFRS as permitted by the transitional arrangements of IFRS1.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has not applied the requirements of IAS21 to goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 April 2004.
Goodwill on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2004 continues to be recorded in sterling, the presentational currency of the Group.
Goodwill arising since 1 April 2004 is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired assets or entity.
IFRS2 Share-based Payment The Group has adopted IFRS2 for all employee share options granted since 7 November 2002, as permitted by the transitional arrangements of IFRS2.
Other than employee share options, the Group has no share-based payments.
IAS19 Employee Benefits The Group has chosen to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the date of transition to IFRS.
The Group has taken advantage of the option available in the amendment to IAS19 issued in December 2004 for subsequent actuarial gains and losses to be recognised immediately in equity.
2 Principal accounting policies a Revenue Revenue comprises commission from the Groups agency business, brokerage from matched principal transactions and fees received from the sale of financial information to third parties.
Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Revenue is generated from the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds and is recognised in full at the time of the simultaneous commitment by the counterparties to sell and purchase the financial instrument.
Following the prospective application of IAS39 from 1 April 2005, the gross amounts due and receivable are included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables notes 18 and 19.
Agency business The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments and raises invoices monthly for the service provided.
The Group does not act as principal and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties.
Revenue is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of the trade.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade debtors within trade and other receivables note 18.
Information services The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information to third parties.
This is stated net of value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade debtors within trade and other receivables note 18. b Government grants Revenue grants received are credited to the income statement in the same period as the related expenditure is charged.
c Intangible assets arising on consolidation Intangible assets arising on consolidation include all goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets identified at the time of acquisition of an entity.
Amortisation or impairment of these assets is disclosed on the face of the income statement.
58 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006 2 Principal accounting policies continued i Goodwill Goodwill arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based upon an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices and by discounting expected future cash flows to present value.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
The transitional arrangements of IFRS3 Business Combinations allow this goodwill to remain eliminated.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 1998, goodwill was capitalised and, until 31 March 2004, was amortised to the income statement on a straight line basis over its useful life.
Since transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004 goodwill is no longer amortised, but is subject to an annual impairment review.
For acquisitions on or after 1 April 2004, separately identifiable intangible assets have been recognised where applicable and are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life.
Any residual goodwill is capitalised on the balance sheet and is subject to an annual impairment review.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements of IFRS3, goodwill previously recognised under UK GAAP has been included in the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 at net book value as an equivalent to fair value.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is shown within intangible fixed assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included within their carrying value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
ii Other separately identifiable intangible assets For acquisitions since 1 April 2004, the Group has applied the provisions of IFRS3 Business Combinations and has separately identified intangible assets where appropriate.
These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are initially stated at fair value and subsequently adjusted for amortisation and any impairment.
Impairment charges are recognised in the income statement.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the income statement on an appropriate basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 2 5 years Customer contracts Period of contract d Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software for electronic trading platforms is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of 3 5 years.
Amortisation of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses in profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in its value.
It is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life as follows: Short leasehold property Period of lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 5 years Motor vehicles 3 4 years The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances.
These rates are determined upon consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.
Annual Report 2006 ICAP plc 59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal accounting policies continued f Leased assets Assets financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet.
Lease repayments comprise both a capital element and a finance element.
The capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as an obligation to the lessor in the balance sheet and the finance element is charged to the income statement on a constant periodic rate of change basis.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
g Investment in associates An associate is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, can exercise significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
The consolidated financial information includes investments in associates under the equity method of accounting.
The income statement includes the Groups share of the post-tax profits or losses of those entities.
The balance sheet shows the Groups share of the net assets or liabilities of those entities, together with any attributable goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets.
h Investment in joint ventures A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating and financial policies.
The consolidated Financial Statements include investments in joint ventures under the proportional consolidation method of accounting.
The income statement and balance sheet include the Groups share of the entities results and net assets on a line-by-line basis.
i Classification of financial assets On adoption of IAS32 and IAS39, financial assets are classified as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables or financial assets at fair value through the income statement.
The two sub-classes for financial assets at fair value through the income statement assets are held-for-trading and assets designated at fair value through the income statement.
The Group has no assets classified as held to maturity.
The classification and accounting treatment for all other financial assets are explained in the appropriate accounting policy note.
j Available for sale investments Available for sale investments are initially recognised at fair value and at subsequent reporting dates any movements in value are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The fair value of available for sale investments is determined by reference to a quoted market price.
Where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, the assets are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
k Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the deal are settled.
Under IAS32, the gross amounts due and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as matched principal trade debtors and matched principal trade creditors notes 18 and 19.
The comparatives which have been presented in accordance with UK GAAP, only include outstanding transactions that have gone beyond settlement date on a gross basis initially unsettled transactions.
l Matched stock lending business Certain Group companies are involved in collateralised stock lending transactions as an intermediary between counterparties.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
Under IAS32, the gross amounts of collateral due and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned notes 18 and 19.
The comparatives which have been presented in accordance with UK GAAP include the net amount in deposits received for securities loaned note 19. m Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
These can include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and cross currency and interest rate swaps.
Under IAS39, which the Group adopted prospectively from 1 April 2005, all derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value adjusted for transaction costs.
The comparatives which have been presented in accordance with UK GAAP, do not recognise derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value when they are hedging a defined financial risk.
60 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006 2 Principal accounting policies continued The fair value of financial instrument derivatives is determined by appropriate valuation techniques as permitted by IAS39, including discounted cash flow analysis and the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Where, under IAS39, financial instrument derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, resultant gains and losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses on financial instrument derivatives which do qualify for hedge accounting are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Fair value hedges: Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
The hedging instrument and hedged item are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
Cash flow hedges: Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses that had previously been recognised directly in equity are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
Net investment hedges: Changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in equity.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedge is generally consistent with the treatment for a cash flow hedge.
n Client money The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the FSA.
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the Group balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to clients.
The amounts held on behalf of clients at the balance sheet date are included in note 33. o Long-term borrowings Long-term borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method with changes in value recognised through the income statement.
p Pension costs For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The pension scheme deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the assets of the plan and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, net of the deferred tax impact.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension plan.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
q Employee share-based payment and share ownership trusts From time to time, the Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of employee incentive schemes.
The Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment for all such awards granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the time of granting, and is charged to staff costs over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A reserve of an equivalent amount is held on the balance sheet as part of the retained earnings.
The fair value of share options awarded is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and takes into account various parameters, including the exercise price, current share price, risk free rate of return and the volatility of ICAPs share price.
The expected lives used in the fair value calculations are adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.
Investments in own shares held in connection with the Groups employee share schemes are deducted from shareholders equity.
Purchases, sales and transfers of own shares are disclosed as changes in equity.
r Taxation Taxation on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also included within equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Annual Report 2006 ICAP plc 61 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Principal accounting policies continued Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group is able to control the timing of dividends from its overseas entities and hence does not expect to remit overseas earnings in the foreseeable future in a way which would result in a tax charge.
As a consequence deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary.
No provision is made in respect of any further taxation liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas joint ventures and associates.
s Foreign currencies In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are taken to operating profit, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are taken directly to reserves.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
On consolidation, the results of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate to the rate at the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are classified within equity and transferred to the Groups retained earnings.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition to IFRS are taken to the income statement on disposal of the net investment.
In accordance with IAS29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit at the balance sheet date before they are translated into the presentational currency of the Group.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Where applicable the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising before the date of transition to IFRS as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the cash flow statement, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rate for the year.
t Accounting estimates and provisions The Group makes various judgements in applying its accounting policies and various assumptions and estimates when determining the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
The estimates, assumptions and judgements that have a significant impact on the Groups results and financial position are discussed below: The Group reviews intangible assets arising on consolidation at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances suggest that an impairment may have taken place.
The Group tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of assets with their recoverable amount.
The calculation of the recoverable amount is based on discounted cash flows from financial budgets.
This requires the use of estimates and judgements in determining the budgeted profit after taxation, discount rate, and growth rates.
The Group provides for impairment of other trade debtors to estimate existing bad debts and amendments to sales invoices.
The provision is estimated based on historic trends.
An increase or decrease in these trends of 1% would not have a material effect on the net assets of the Group.
The Group determines estimated useful economic lives of its intangible assets arising on development expenditure based on projected lifecycles.
Technological advances and other factors could result in these estimates no longer being appropriate.
If actual useful economic lives were to differ from the Groups estimate by 10%, the carrying value of intangible assets would be 0.5m lower or 0.6m higher respectively.

This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.

The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee benefit trusts.
12 Earnings per ordinary share Under IFRS the Group is required to disclose basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement.
The Group will continue to calculate an adjusted EPS measurement ratio in the notes to the Financial Statements as it believes that it is the most appropriate measurement since it better reflects the Groups underlying cash earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent of 117.2m 2005 107.5m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 597.5m shares 2005 586.9m.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held by trusts relating to employee share schemes to which the participating employees are not unconditionally entitled, being 9.2m shares 2005 9.9m.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of share options outstanding under the Companys employee share schemes and the dilutive effect of contingent share capital.

82 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006 23 Financial instruments a Risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and treasury liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The overall financial risk management framework, strategy and policies of the Group are determined by the board.
It does this through two board committees, the Group Risk and Treasury Committees, and also by regional and market risk committees.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to the US dollar and euro.
Market risk arising from movements in foreign exchange rates is identified and monitored on a daily basis.
Such risks are managed by operating bank accounts in foreign currencies and by using external forward currency contracts and options.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is managed by the Treasury Committee by the use of a limited number of interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives.
Credit risk The Group transacts business on an agency or matched principal basis and therefore its exposure to credit risk, and significant concentrations of credit risk, is limited.
The Group has global policies and procedures in place to ensure that counterparties are of appropriate credit worthiness and that limits are set and monitored at entity, parent and country level to restrict the exposure to potential losses.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the total fair value of the financial assets.
Treasury risk Prudent treasury risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and ensuring the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit.
The Group maintains sufficient resources to finance its operations as monitored by the Treasury Committee.
The Groups approach to managing financial risk is also described in the Corporate Governance statement on pages 32 to 37.

Annual Report 2006 ICAP plc 99 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Contingent liabilities Group a In July 2003, it was announced that two of the Groups subsidiaries and the Company were among those being sued in connection with an alleged infringement of patent number 6,560,580 580 Patent in the United States of America.
The Group rejected the claim.
The jury trial commenced on 7 February 2005.
Prior to the commencement of the trial, the claimants stated their damage claims against the defendants, including the Group, to be an amount of up to $104m as at 30 September 2004.
On the first day of trial, the Court dismissed all of the monetary claims against the Group.
The Court also dismissed all of the claims challenging use of the OM Click Exchange System for ICAP Electronic Broking LLC formerly BrokerTec USA LLC IEB.
The case then proceeded to trial on the limited issue of the claimants request for injunctive relief as to the use of a second computer system, the ICAP Securities USA LLC formerly Garban LLC ICAP Securities GTN and on the Groups counterclaim for judgment declaring that the ICAP Securities GTN did not infringe the 580 Patent.
On 22 February 2005, the jury found that the application for the 580 Patent failed to provide an adequate written description in certain of the 580 Patent claims.
In addition, the jury found that the ICAP Securities GTN infringed certain claims of the 580 Patent, but that the claimed infringement had not been wilful.
On 4 April 2005, the claimants and the Group filed post-trial applications.
On 12 December 2005, the Court ruled on the claimants and the Groups applications pertaining to the jurys verdict and denied all applications, thus leaving the jurys verdict undisturbed.
On 22 February 2006, the Court ruled on the Groups application pertaining to claimants asserted inequitable conduct in the prosecution of the 580 Patent.
The Court ruled in favour of the Group and declared that the 580 Patent was procured by inequitable conduct and as a result was unenforceable.
A final order as to all matters decided by the jury and the Court was entered on 3 April 2006.
On 27 April 2006 a claimant filed a Notice of Appeal seeking to appeal the jurys decision and the Courts ruling.
At this stage it is not possible to predict the outcome with certainty or to determine the extent of liability, if any, of the Group following any appeal, but based on current available information and after consultation with the Groups lawyers the directors continue to expect a successful outcome for the Group.
No provision has been made in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2006. b ICAP plc has received correspondence from National Australia Bank NAB alleging that revaluation data, supplied by an individual within ICAP-Nittan Pte Limited ICAP-Nittan, one of ICAPs Singapore subsidiaries, and a member of the TFS-ICAP joint venture, helped mask trading losses in NABs foreign exchange options business.
On 27 January 2004 NAB announced that it incurred foreign exchange option trading losses of A$360 million 158 million.
Detailed reports following full investigations into these losses were published by  PwC and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in March 2004 and indicated that NAB incurred these foreign exchange trading losses between April 2003 and January 2004.
The PwC report includes descriptions of how certain NAB dealers concealed losses by processing false spot foreign exchange and false foreign exchange option transactions, booking one-sided internal foreign exchange option transactions and using incorrect dealing rates for genuine transactions.
The reports analyse the cause of these trading losses, including the methods of concealment allegedly employed by the NAB dealers, repeated failures of NAB risk management, absence of NAB financial controls, gaps in NAB back office procedures, inadequate NAB corporate governance and NAB corporate cultural weaknesses.
NAB accepted the findings of the PwC report on 28 April 2004.
Neither ICAP-Nittan nor any other member of the ICAP Group or TFS-ICAP accept any responsibility for these NAB foreign exchange trading losses and intend to vigorously contest any claim which may be made against them in this matter.
ICAP-Nittan has been informed that a similar allegation has been asserted by NAB against another inter-dealer broker, which is not a party to the TFS-ICAP joint venture, in respect of these foreign exchange options trading losses.
It is not possible at this stage to predict the outcome with certainty nor to determine the extent of liability, if any, of ICAP plc or ICAP-Nittan.
No provision has been made in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2006. c From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation on employee related and other matters.
It is not possible to quantify the extent of such liabilities but they are not expected to have a material, adverse effect on the Groups results or net assets.
d In the normal course of business, certain Group companies enter into guarantees to cover trading arrangements.
Company The company has provided a guarantee in respect of the $225m subordinated debt private placement.

106 ICAP plc Annual Report 2006 36 Impact of the adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 as at 1 April 2005 On 1 April 2005, the Group adopted IAS32 and IAS39 prospectively.
The revaluation and reclassification of certain amounts to comply with these standards resulted in a number of adjustments to the opening balance sheet.
A reconciliation of these adjustments is detailed below: a Matched principal transactions Matched principal transactions, including collaterised stock lending transactions, are now shown gross in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
The adjustment required on 1 April 2005 was a gross-up to trade and other receivables and trade and other payables of 175,310.8m.
The net effect on the net assets of the Group was nil.
b Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments were recognised on the balance sheet as at 1 April 2005.
The fair value of these hedging instruments was 4.7m which was credited to the hedging reserve.
The fair value of other derivative financial instruments of 2.7m, that did not meet the hedging criteria, were immediately recognised as a charge to equity within retained earnings.
The net effect on the net assets of the Group was an increase of 2.0m.
c Contingent share capital The contingent share capital is considered to be a liability under IAS39, and therefore has been reclassified to trade and other payables from equity.
This results in a decrease in the net assets of the Group as at 1 April 2005 of 7.0m.
d Other adjustments Other IAS32 and IAS39 adjustments as at 1 April 2005 represent: i A credit to the revaluation reserve of 4.3m.
This is due to the revaluation of available for sale investments to fair value of 2.8m note 17, a revaluation to fair value of the net assets of an associate of 2.3m note 16, offset by the recognition of a loss on a fair value hedge of 0.8m.
ii Other investments of 4.1m have been reclassified to trading investments.
iii Trade and other receivables and retained earnings have been reduced by 0.2m due to a change in the Groups policy for the impairment of trade debtors.
