Country of incorporation Dexion Absolute Limited the Company was incorporated on 26 November 2002 in Guernsey, Channel Islands.
The Companys initial shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange on 19 December 2002.
Significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements: a Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention adjusted by the revaluation of investments and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by the Company and are consistent with those used in the previous reporting period.
b Revenue recognition Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accrual basis.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis.
d Valuation of investments Classification Under Financial Reporting Standards No.
26 Financial Instruments: Measurement FRS 26, the Company has designated all of its investments as fair value through profit or loss category.
This category comprises: Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition these include financial assets that are not held for trading purposes and which may be sold.
These are principally investments in unlisted open-ended investment funds.
Financial instruments held for trading these include forward foreign currency contracts.
Measurement Investments are measured initially at fair value being the transaction price.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all investments are measured at fair value with changes in their fair value recognised in the statement of total return.
Fair value measurement principles Investments in underlying open ended funds which are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange or other trading facility will be valued at the net asset values provided by such entities or their administrators.
These values may be unaudited or may themselves be estimates.
In addition, these entities or their administrators may not provide values at all or in a timely manner and, to the extent that values are not available, those investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser using valuation techniques appropriate to those investments.
As open ended funds are redeemable at their net asset values, the Manager believes that the net asset values represent the best estimate of trading price in an arms length transaction and therefore represent fair value.
In instances where other valuation techniques are used, the Manager has no reason to believe that the valuations used are unreasonable.

Derivatives and Financial Instruments The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in an actively managed portfolio of hedge funds, diversified by investment strategy, style and manager, in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, with little correlation to equity and fixed interest benchmarks.
The techniques and instruments utilised for the purposes of efficient portfolio management are those which are reasonably believed by the Companys Investment Manager to be economically appropriate to the efficient management of the Company.
The Companys financial instruments include cash and currency hedging.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk and interest rate risk, currency risk and investment risk.
a Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss that might be suffered through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Investment Adviser in pursuance of its investment objectives and policies.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowing restrictions set out in the Companys prospectus dated 11 August 2006 mitigate the risk of excessive exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
b Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk.
Interest receivable on bank deposits or payable on bank overdraft positions will be affected by fluctuations in interest rates.
As at 31 December 2006 the Companys interest bearing assets and liabilities, all of which receive or pay interest at a variable rate, were as follows: 2006 2005 Cash 1,024,502 Bank overdraft 28,961,775 24,347,050 25 209183 Absolute pp21-imp 4 5 07 14:04 Page 26 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11.
Derivatives and Financial Instruments continued The Company has a combined overdraft and foreign exchange facility dated 17 August 2006 with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited up to a maximum of 170 million or 20% of Net Value of Assets in custody whichever is the lower.
The facility is repayable on demand and secured by a charge over the assets of the Company.
c Currency risk In the normal course of business the Company engages in currency hedging solely to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations and the volatility of returns which may result from currency exposure.
This involves hedging the assets, which are predominantly US dollar based, to sterling, euro and Australian dollars, as appropriate through the use of rolling forward foreign exchange transactions.
