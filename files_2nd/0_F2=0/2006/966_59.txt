Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
For those share schemes which do not include non-market vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo method at the grant date and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model.
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the date of grant.
For all share schemes with non-market related vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the associated charge.
Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they re ect current expectations.
Accounting for share-based payments is the same as under IFRS 2 and details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to the charge included in the Company financial statements is set out in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2006.
