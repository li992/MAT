The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units have been determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to charge out rates during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
The discount rates used range from 4% to 6% per annum.
Growth rates are based on managements expectations of future business volumes and range from 2% to 10% per annum.
Changes in charge out rates are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the respective markets.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows for the following nine years, which is the minimum period the Directors believe that economic benefits will be derived from the goodwill.
