NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Significant accounting policies Gyrus Group PLC is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
The address of the Companys registered office is Fortran Road, St Mellons, Cardiff, CF3 0LT.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 15 March 2007. b Basis of preparation The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments that are stated at their fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods in these consolidated financial statements.
As permitted under IFRS 3 and as disclosed in notes 2 and 9 an adjustment has been made to the opening goodwill balance arising on the acquisition of ACMI.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
ii Exchange differences arising on consolidation On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and on the difference between the results of overseas operations translated at average monthly exchange rates and year-end rates are dealt with through the Groups translation reserve.
e Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recorded at fair value and any gains or losses on remeasurement of fair values is taken to the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resulting gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
Gyrus Group PLC 47 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED f Cash flow hedging When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Group revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
ii Leased assets Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The lease is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is the shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included in creditors.
iii Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 3-10 years Buildings 20 years Leasehold improvements term of lease Plant and machinery 3-10 years Placed equipment 3 years Placed equipment relates to equipment placed in clinical settings to generate a stream of disposables revenue.
Utilisation of such equipment is measured and provision made where appropriate for impairment.
h Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is tested for impairment annually, or on such other occasions that events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
As part of its transition to IFRS, the Group elected to restate only those business combinations that occurred on or after 1 January 2004.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount under the Groups previous accounting framework.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill which has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure arising from the Groups development activities is capitalised and amortised over the life of the product only if the Group can demonstrate the following: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so it will be available for use or sale: The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it: The ability to use or sell the intangible asset: That it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: There is the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset: and The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Gyrus Group PLC 48 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Where no intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the life of the product, which is usually no more than 10 years.
iii Licensing agreements Licensing agreements are included at cost and depreciated over their useful economic life.
Provision is made for any impairment.
iv Intellectual property rights Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
v Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on a capitalised intangible asset is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
vi Intangibles arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings On acquisition, intangible assets are identified and valued in accordance with IFRS 3.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relevant intangibles unless such life is indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date, or whenever there is evidence of impairment.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 5-10 years Acquired research and development As identified at acquisition date Licensing agreements Life of the agreement or underlying patent Intellectual property rights Life of the underlying right e. g. patent Customer relationships As identified at acquisition date Trademarks As identified at acquisition date The estimated lives of acquired intangibles are as follows: In process research and development 11-12 years Developed product technology 6-11 years Customer relationships 5-12 years Trademarks 19 years i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value less impairment losses.
j Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in first out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is the price at which the stocks can be sold in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from their existing state to a finished condition.
Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory in determining net realisable value.
Finished goods acquired as a result of business combinations are valued at the selling price less the costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress acquired as a result of business combinations is valued at the selling price of the finished goods less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for completing and selling the goods.
Raw materials acquired as a result of business combinations are valued at current replacement cost.
The fair value adjustment arising as a result of the valuation exercise is reduced over the period of the inventory turn of the acquired company.
The resulting charge is taken to the income statement.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes only of the statement of cash flows.
Gyrus Group PLC 49 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED l Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets with finite lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or on such other occasions that events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is land or buildings at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but such that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
However, impairment losses relating to goodwill may not be reversed.
m Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value less attributable costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of borrowings on an effective interest basis.
n Employee Benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The Group has obligations to two defined benefit plans which were assumed on 21 July 2005 as part of the acquisition of American Cystoscope Makers Inc.
The details of these plans are disclosed in note 19 to the accounts.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pensions plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their services in current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine the present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is an actuarially defined rate, based upon long-term interest rates, used to determine the present value of gross future obligations of the scheme.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to the acquisition of American Cystoscope Makers Inc are recognised directly in equity in the period that they occur through the statement of recognised income and expense.
iii Share based payment transactions In accordance with the transition provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of shares or share options made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Gyrus Group PLC 50 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The fair value of services received in return for share options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a stochastic option pricing model.
This model takes into account the following variables: exercise price, share price at grant, expected term, expected volatility of share price, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield.
The Group also gives employees the opportunity to purchase shares in the Group by participating in a share purchase plan.
The option price for the UK Save As You Earn scheme is the market price on the day preceding the invitation date discounted by a maximum of 80%.
The share options under this plan are also treated as equity settled share based payments and the fair value calculated using a stochastic model.
In May 2005, the Group issued the first grant under the Gyrus 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
This is a discretionary plan which provides for the grant of conditional awards or nil cost options over 1p ordinary shares in the Company.
Awards normally vest following the third anniversary of grant once certain performance conditions have been satisfied and provided that the participant remains employed by the Group.
The performance conditions are based on earnings per share growth.
The fair value of grants under this scheme are determined as being the mid market quote on the day preceding grant which is charged to the income statement evenly over the three-year vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Further awards have been made under this scheme during 2006 and the details of these grants are provided within note 16. o Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to meet that obligation.
i Restructuring Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a formal plan for the restructuring and it has been notified to affected parties by the balance sheet date.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
p Trade and other payables Trade payables are stated at their fair value.
q Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, discounts and rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and payment is probable.
Royalty revenue relating to licensed technology is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer or when advised by the other party to the royalty contract that the royalty is earned.
Revenue excludes VAT and similar taxes.
r Other income Other income represents revenues derived from collaborative development agreements and is recognised in accordance with the applicable contract terms.
s Cost of Sales Cost of sales represents the material, labour and production overheads incurred in manufacturing the products sold or the purchase cost and directly attributable handling costs of products bought for re-sale.
Gyrus Group PLC 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED t Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned on an effective interest basis, between the finance element, which is charged to the income statement account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligations for future instalments.
iii Financial expenses Financial expenses comprise interest payable on borrowings, foreign exchange losses and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
iv Financial income Financial income comprises interest income recognised in the income statement as it accrues, interest receivable on funds invested and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
u Income Tax The charge for current tax is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Where the Group is able to control the distribution of reserves from subsidiaries, and there is no intention to distribute the reserves, deferred tax is not recognised for these temporary differences.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Information as to the calculation of the income tax expense is included in note 9. v Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates in key areas, and the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are: Forecasts and discount rates The carrying value of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the Group's operations: The impairment tests for goodwill are dependent on forecasts of the cash flows of the cash-generating units that give rise to the goodwill and the discount rate applied.
No impairment resulted from the annual impairment testing conducted in 2006.
The realisation of deferred tax assets recognised is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets where it is likely that the benefit will be realised and recognises no more than five years of tax losses see note 12.
Gyrus Group PLC 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Provisions The Group measures provisions at the directors best estimates of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.

Gyrus Group PLC 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1.
Segment reporting Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups business Divisions, which are the primary basis of segment reporting.
The business segment reporting format reflects the Groups management and internal reporting structures for 2006.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Business segments The Group is comprised of the following main business segments: ENT Design, development, manufacture, marketing and sales of otology, sinus and rhinology and head and neck products.
Surgical Design, development, manufacture, marketing and sales of laparoscopic surgery products.
Urology & Gynaecology Design, development, marketing and sales of urology and gynaecology and visualisation products.
Partnered Technologies Out-licensing of Groups proprietary technology in conjunction with a manufacturing contract for markets outside the Groups core sales and marketing competence.
The 2005 segmental comparative for the Urology & Gynaecology Division represents the activities of ACMI between the date of acquisition 21 July 2005 and the year ended 31 December 2005.
As part of the Group restructuring, a number of products were transferred between the Surgical, Urology & Gynaecology and Partnered Technology Divisions.
The effect of these changes is identified in a reconciliation of the 2005 revenue comparative in the result by segment.

Acquisitions of subsidiaries in comparative period i Acquisition of Urology Solutions Pty Limited On 16 March 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Urology Solutions Pty Limited renamed Gyrus Australasia Pty Limited, the exclusive distributor of Gyruss surgical products in Australia and New Zealand for total consideration of 1,170,000 satisfied by cash and deferred consideration.
In the nine months to 31 December 2005 the subsidiary reduced Group operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2005 by 421,000.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2005, the subsidiary would have reduced Group operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2005 by 460,000.
Effect of acquisition The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.

Gyrus Group PLC 57 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries in comparative period continued As required by IFRS 3, the fair value adjustment to inventory for finished goods represents the selling price of the goods less costs to dispose and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress was similarly valued and includes an allowance for the costs to complete.
The resulting fair value adjustment of 4,686,000 has been recognised.
The acquisition of ACMI has provided Gyrus with the opportunity to combine ACMIs urology, gynaecology and endoscopic expertise with Gyruss tissue management technology in these fields.
This enables the enlarged Group to meet two key requirements of surgeons the ability to visualise the operative site and the ability effectively to manipulate tissue with minimum collateral damage.
Goodwill of 180 million arose as a result of the synergistic and integration benefits of combining the two organisations.
Between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2005, ACMI contributed the following to the operating profit of the Group.

However, following a detailed review of these expenses, 4.1 million has been treated as allowable resulting in a prior year adjustment of 1.5 million.
Other significant adjustments were in respect of depreciation, accrued interest and changes in estimates.
As a result of previous acquisitions during 2000 and 2001 certain deferred tax assets were not recognised as it was considered unlikely that they would be utilised in future periods.
The performance of these acquisitions are now better than originally anticipated thus, under IAS 12 Income Taxes, the Group has adjusted goodwill equal to the tax benefit of the subsequently recognised losses.
Accordingly a deferred tax asset of 2,054,000 was recognised and utilised together with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill net of a credit of 281,000 in respect of over amortisation in the period before the transition to IFRSs.
Reconciliation of effective tax rate The total tax charge for the year is lower 2005: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.

Capital Commitments As at 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into contracts to purchase property, plant and equipment of 455,000 2005: 411,000.
Fair values were assigned to ACMIs identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of information available.
Subsequent to the initial accounting for this business combination, a liability of 224,000 has been identified that existed at the balance sheet date but for which no fair value was attributed on acquisition.
As permitted under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the liability has been recognised within twelve months of the acquisition date as an adjustment to the opening goodwill arising an acquisition.
Net assets and liabilities restated at the acquisition date are 14,711,000 and goodwill restated at acquisition 180,575,000.
There is no impact on either profit or adjusted earnings per share for the years ended 31 December 2005 or 31 December 2006.
2 The final deferred consideration payment to Gyrus Medical BV was 51,000 below the maximum potential payment under the terms of the contract resulting in an adjustment to goodwill in the year ended 31 December 2005.
Reduction in the value of deferred discounted goodwill of 115,000.
As disclosed in note 9, the reduction in the value of goodwill as a result of the recognition of a deferred tax asset resulting from pre-acquisition trading losses in pre-IFRS transitional acquisitions should be recognised as an expense and pre-transition goodwill adjusted accordingly.
Gyrus Group PLC 63 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill principally relates to ACMI 165,375,000, Gyrus Medical Inc 19,777,000 and Gyrus ENT LLC 59,060,000.
The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed on a value-in-use basis using internal forecasts and a discount rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Value-in-use was determined by discounting future cash flows.
The cash flows were projected based on actual operating results and the five year business plan.
Following the initial projection, constant growth rates, based on long-term industry averages, were applied to revenue for a further 20 year period together with an inflationary adjustment to operating expenditure.
The key assumptions supporting the carrying value of goodwill were revenue growth, price and cost changes and improvement to operational efficiency based on past experiences and externally sourced information.
No impairment arose as a result of the review.
The estimates and assumptions made in connection with impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net asset liability 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 000 000 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 543 3,081 543 3,081 Intangible assets 358 99 358 99 Goodwill on US acquisitions 1,506 1,878 3,654 3,022 2,148 1,144 Share options 2,152 1,034 2,152 1,034 Provisions 7,135 7,383 7,135 7,383 Business combinations 33,477 41,368 33,477 41,368 Accrued interest 1,749 2,525 1,749 2,525 Tax value of loss carry-forwards recognised 11,712 11,949 11,712 11,949 Tax assets liabilities 24,254 24,769 38,032 47,570 13,778 22,801 Goodwill on US acquisitions IFRS requires that deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences which are expected to be recovered.
A temporary difference arises between the tax and accounting treatment of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the assets made by Gyrus e. g. ENT Division.
For tax purposes, relief is obtained on the goodwill whereas for accounting purposes the amount is no longer amortised and only tested for impairment.
Share options In accordance with IFRS 2 Share based payments, the Group has recognised a charge to the income statement which represents the fair value of outstanding share based payments granted to employees.
However, for tax purposes, most option schemes will only give rise to a deduction at the date of exercise, thus giving rise to a temporary timing difference between the accounting and tax treatment.
IFRS therefore also requires that deferred tax is recognised on this temporary difference which is expected to be recovered.
The basis of calculation for deferred taxation is the difference between the market price at the balance sheet date and the exercise price of the share based payment reflecting expected levels of vesting.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2006 2005 000 000 Tax losses 6,644 11,344 The deferred tax asset not recognised relates solely to past losses in the US that are not expected to be utilised within the next five years.
As a result of previous acquisitions, the amount of losses that can be utilised in the US are subject to an annual limitation.
Currently the Group has recognised five years worth of these losses.
Inventories 2006 2005 000 000 Raw materials and consumables 11,886 17,054 Work in progress 3,342 3,906 Finished goods and goods for resale 17,125 12,180 32,353 33,140 Included in the analysis above are provisions against inventory amounting to 12,304,000 2005: 15,772,000.
Reversal of provisions arising from the write up of inventory due to a change in economic circumstances resulted in a credit to the income statement of 295,000 2005: nil.
Trade and other receivables 2006 2005 000 000 Trade receivables 33,713 35,509 Other trade receivables and prepayments 7,076 8,849 40,789 44,358 The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and non-trade receivables approximates to their fair values.

Adjusted basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing adjusted profit attributable to ordinary shareholders see table below for adjustments made of 25,030,000 year ended 31 December 2005: 15,835,000 by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 146,492,872 year ended 31 December 2005: 111,601,948.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share has been calculated by dividing adjusted profit attributable to ordinary shareholders see table below for adjustments made of 25,030,000 year ended 31 December 2005: 15,385,000 by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 150,785,514 year ended 31 December 2005: 115,368,521.

The award will create a charge over approximately three years until the potential vesting date of July 2008.
The charge relating to this award is considered to be another form of integration restructuring cost.
The tax credit of 2,128,000 associated with restructuring costs comprises a deferred taxation credit of 1,927,000 2005: 900,000 and a current taxation benefit of 201,000 2005: nil.
The current taxation benefit has been deducted from adjusted earnings per share to correctly reflect the net impact of restructuring.
The current taxation benefit is lower than the effective tax rate as the costs of integration have principally been incurred within the US where tax losses are available to offset profits.
In 2005, all integration costs were incurred in the US and hence no tax benefit was added back in that year.

As at 10 November 2006, Gyrus Group PLC voluntarily reduced the revolving credit facility to USD$15 million.
The decision was made to avoid unnecessary non-utilisation costs on the unused portion of the facility.
The USD$250 million loan is for a fixed term of five years with repayments due as disclosed in this note.
The loan attracts a maximum rate of US dollar LIBOR plus 1.75% provided that Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the facility agreement is less than 3.50 and a minimum rate of US dollar LIBOR plus 0.75% provided that Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA is less than 1.00.
The margin on the facility from inception to 30 October 2006 was 1.75%.
As at 31 October 2006 the quarterly Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA fell below 3.00:1 resulting in a reduction in the margin on the facility of 0.5% to 1.25%.
Each advance drawn down under the $15 million revolving credit facility is repaid on the last business day of each fixed term interest period typically three to six months.
As the term of the revolving credit facility is for a period of five years from 21 July 2005, amounts drawn down under this facility are shown as non-current liabilities where repayments are due in greater than one year.
The interest rate for each advance drawn under the revolving facility is fixed on the date of the advance for the agreed interest period at US dollar LIBOR plus a margin.
The margin follows that applied to the main term loan facility.
There were no amounts drawn down under this facility as at 31 December 2006 31 December 2005: USD$1,650,000 and EUR5,000,000.
The USD$250 million loan and USD$15 million revolving credit facility are secured by a fixed and floating debenture on the assets of the Group.

Employee benefits Defined contribution plans The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where employees leave the schemes before the vesting date the employers contributions are refunded.
The total cost charged to income of 1,330,000 2005: 748,000 represents amounts payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
As at 31 December 2006 contributions of 307,000 2005: 656,000 due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes and are included within non-trade payables.
Defined benefit plans The Group has two defined benefit plans.
Retirement plan for hourly rated employees ACMI, has a non-contributory defined benefit plan the Plan covering hourly union employees at one of the Groups manufacturing facilities.
The Company contributes such amounts as are necessary on an actuarial basis to provide the Plan with assets sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to the Plan participants.
Under this scheme employees are entitled to receive a defined monthly benefit at a normal retirement age of 65.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the scheme are as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Current service cost 87 38 Interest cost 143 59 Expected return on plan assets 158 62 72 35 The expense is recognised in the following line items in the income statement: 2006 2005 000 000 Cost of sales 87 38 Financial income 158 62 Financial expense 143 59 72 35 Gyrus Group PLC 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The amount included in the balance sheet in respect of this defined benefit retirement plan is as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Present value of funded obligations 2,486 2,807 Fair value of plan assets 2,883 2,861 Asset recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 December 397 54 The plan assets of the scheme are distributed between cash, equity and fixed income investments as follows: 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents 11% 15% US equity 41% 41% International equity 11% 9% Fixed income investments 37% 35% Total 100% 100% The objective for the assets above is protection of capital and a targeted average annual return net of fees equating to the expected return rate.

Employee benefits continued Mortality rates in both the 2005 and 2006 valuations are based on the 1994 Group Annuity Mortality Table.
Sample rates from this table are shown below to provide an indication of mortality levels of both males and females between 40 and 70 years of age.
A fixed pension amount is paid to all scheme members on retirement irrespective of final salary.
Pension rises of 2.5%, compounded annually, have been included in the calculation of the present value of the pension obligation.
Gyrus Group PLC expects to contribute 220,000 to this plan during 2007.
Multi employer pension plan ACMI contributes on a monthly basis an amount that has been pre-agreed with the union into a multi employer pension plan.
The union does not provide actuarial valuations of the scheme to participating employers however, during the acquisition of ACMI in 2005, the union notified a funding deficit of $1,175,000.
As a result, an agreement was entered into between the union and ACMI whereby ACMI agreed to make increased contributions to the scheme totalling $1,175,000 approximately 601,000 as at 31 December 2006 over a three year period.
During the year, pension contributions totalling 156,000 2005: 100,000 were paid into the scheme and, as at 31 December 2006, pension contributions accrued and not paid amounted to nil 2005: 77,000 and are included in non-trade payables.

Under the terms of the warranty, the Group undertakes to repair and replace items that fail to perform to specification.
The period of warranty is dependent upon the type of product but generally is one year from the point of sale to the end user.
Restructuring As disclosed in note 3, since the acquisition of ACMI a number of restructuring costs have been incurred including severance costs, manufacturing inefficiencies and duplication of other costs from the relocation of production, core integration team expenses and set up costs associated with the customer service and distribution centre and Mexican facility and a number of sundry costs.
Notification of termination to individuals affected by restructuring activities occurred prior to 31 December 2006 but certain severance costs will only be paid out during 2007.
The provision reflects those expenses that will be paid during 2007.
Environmental As part of the acquisition of ACMI an independent report was commissioned to assess the potential level of contaminates at two manufacturing sites in the US.
Follow up investigations during 2006 have supported the level of provisioning and remediation work has begun.
The provision represents the remaining anticipated expense.
It is expected that it will take approximately 24 months to complete the work.
Pension As disclosed in note 19, ACMI contributes on a monthly basis an amount that has been pre-agreed with the union into a multi employer pension plan.
Other Other includes a provision for the resolution of an ongoing customer dispute.

Financial instruments Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Credit risk The Group sets credit limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references.
Credit limits are reviewed by Credit Controllers on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is very limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by independent international credit rating companies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest rate risk Hedging The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that at least 50% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on fixed term borrowings is hedged.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into two interest rate cap and collar transactions.
The cap on both financial instruments is a US dollar LIBOR rate of 4.75% and the collars are 4.19% and 3.96% respectively.
Both instruments mature over the next five years consistent with the maturity of the related USD$250 million loan.
At 31 December 2006 the Group had interest rate hedges with a notional contract amount of USD$176,250,000 2005: USD$187,500,000.
The Group classifies interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
This amount was recognised as a non-trade receivable in other current assets.
Includes a margin of 1.75% for the period 1 January 2006 to 30 October 2006 and a margin of 1.25% from 31 October 2006 to 31 December 2006.
Liability bears interest at a fixed rate.
Foreign currency risk The Group incurs foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currency primarily giving rise to this risk is the US dollar.
The Group hedges at least 80% of the anticipated US dollar cash flows for net anticipated receivables payables in the first three months forward, at least 50% in months four to six forward and at least 25% in months seven to twelve forward.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
All of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date.
When financing material asset purchases or acquisitions the Groups policy is to create a natural hedge as far as possible in respect of any borrowings used for such purposes.
In respect of the ACMI acquisition, the Group applied this policy by raising the loan facility in US dollars, being the principal currency of the assets acquired and the trade of ACMI.
The Group designates its forward exchange contracts hedging firm commitments and forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of these forward exchange contracts as at 31 December 2006 was 51,000 2005: a liability of 147,000 comprising an asset of 94,000 2005: nil that is recognised in non-trade receivables and a liability of 43,000 2005: 147,000 recognised in non-trade payables.
The exchange rate for the transaction was dependent upon the prevailing spot rate three working days prior to the Settlement Date.
If the spot was greater than 1.7880, then the exchange rate used for conversion to sterling was 1.7880.
If the spot rate was between 1.6750 and 1.7880, then the exchange rate used was the spot rate, and if the spot was less than 1.6750, then the exchange rate used was 1.7385.
The fair value of this hedging contract on a mark to market basis was 23,000.
This was recognised as a financial liability and is contained within non-trade payables as at 31 December 2005.
No such contractual arrangements existed as at 31 December 2006.
Adjustments to the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in equity when designated as effective hedges.
The ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Otherwise the gains and losses will be reported in the income statement only when the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognised in the income statement.
A summary of the impact of cash flow hedges on equity and on the income statement is disclosed on page 78.

The Group does not hedge its exposure to fluctuations in earnings based upon translation of foreign currency earnings on consolidation.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The USD$250 million loan and USD$15 million revolver facilities attract interest based on US dollar LIBOR.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 424,000 2005: 628,000.
Interest rate hedges have been included in this calculation.
Although the Group consolidates a number of entities whose functional currency is not sterling, 87% of revenue is US$ denominated.
It is estimated that a general reduction of 10 percentage points in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 2,048,000 2005: 2,375,000.

The lease of one of the ACMI manufacturing sites has lease payments of approximately 561,000 per annum.
The inception date of the lease was March 2003 and the lease ends in December 2009.
Lease increases of 3% per annum are included within the contract.
The lease of the ACMI head office has lease payments of approximately 626,000 per annum.
The inception date of the lease was February 2002 and the lease ends in April 2012.
There are no provisions for increases in rent in the terms of the contract.
During the year ended 31 December 2006 3,037,000 2005: 1,787,000 was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases.
Related parties Key management personnel compensation In addition to their salaries, the Group also provides non-cash benefits to directors and executive officers and contributes to postemployment pension plans on their behalf.
Executive officers also participate in the Groups share option and Long Term Incentive programmes.
