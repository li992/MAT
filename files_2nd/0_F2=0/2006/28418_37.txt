Nature of operations Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in the UK, the US and Asia.
The Group operates in the UK through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, Prudential Annuities Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited, M&G Group Limited and Egg Banking plc.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
In Asia, A the Groups main operations are in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.
The Company is responsible for the financing of each of its subsidiaries except Egg, which is responsible for its own financing.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the balance sheet and related notes, are prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985, which apply to companies generally.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
C The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP.
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement on the basis that its cash flow is included within the cash flow statement in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with D entities that are part of the Group or investees of the Group.
In addition, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation from the disclosure requirements of this standard on the basis that the Company is included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the Group which include disclosures that comply with IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, which E is equivalent to FRS 25.
Significant accounting policies Changes in accounting policies F The Company has early adopted the amendment to FRS 17 issued in December 2006 in preparing the results for the year ended 31 December 2006.
The main effect of this amendment is to replace the existing disclosure requirements of FRS 17 with those of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The amended disclosures are shown in note 8.
The measurement change from this amendment where pension assets should now be valued at current bid value rather than mid-market value, has an immaterial effect on the Companys results.
G Significant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings in the balance sheet of the Company are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings H Loans to subsidiary undertakings in the balance sheet of the Company are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage interest rate and currency exposures.
The Companys policy is that amounts at risk through derivative transactions are covered by cash or by corresponding assets.
Derivative financial instruments are I carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Under FRS 26 Financial Instruments Measurement, hedge accounting is permissible only if certain criteria are met regarding the establishment of documentation and continued measurement of hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, the movements in the fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the accompanying change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds net of related issue costs is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date in respect of the prior reporting period are treated as a non-adjusting event.
Where scrip dividends are issued, the value of such shares, measured as the amount of the cash dividend alternative, is credited to reserves and the amount in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued is transferred from the share premium account to retained profit.

Significant accounting policies continued Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares, net of issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
A Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
B Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reflected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of C taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
D Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same E accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups largest pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
Further details are disclosed in note 8.
The Company applies the requirements of FRS 17 as amended in December F 2006 to its portion of PSPS surplus or deficit.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
G The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cashflows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the H profit and loss account.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets or experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

The Company has a US$1,000 million fair value hedge in place which hedges the interest exposure on the US$1,000 million 6.5 per cent perpetual subordinated capital securities.
During 2006, the Company entered into a transaction to extend the term of the interest-rate swap of this hedging relationship from 30 years to 50 years.
D The derivative financial instruments were valued internally using standard market practices.
In accordance with the Companys risk management framework, all internally generated valuations are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
Pension scheme financial position E The majority of UK Prudential staff are members of the Groups pension schemes.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
This scheme is primarily a defined benefit scheme but no employees with employment offers after 31 July 2003 are eligible for membership of the defined benefit section of the scheme.
At 31 December 2006, on the FRS 17, Retirement Benefits basis of valuation, PSPS accounts for 88 per cent 2005: 89 per cent of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
F For the purposes of preparing consolidated financial statements, the Group applies IFRS basis accounting including IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
However, the individual accounts of the Company continue to apply UK GAAP.
For 2006, this includes the early adoption of the amendment to FRS 17 issued in December 2006 which aligns the FRS 17 disclosures with IAS 19.
During 2005, the allocation of surpluses and deficits attaching to PSPS between the Company and the unallocated surplus of the G Prudential Assurance Companys PAC with-profits funds was clarified.
The surpluses or deficits of PSPS have been apportioned based on the weighted cumulative activity attaching to the contributions paid into the scheme in the past.
Prior to 2005, 20 per cent of the deficit has been attributed to the Company and 80 per cent to the PAC with-profits fund.
At 31 December 2005, the deficit of PSPS was apportioned in the ratio 30 70 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund following detailed consideration of the sourcing of H previous contributions.
This ratio has continued to be applied for 2006 to movements in the financial position that relate to opening assets and liabilities.
However, the FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions, are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
The projected unit method was used for the most recent full actuarial valuation.
Defined benefit schemes are generally required to be subject I to full actuarial valuation every three years to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes having regard to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
PSPS was last actuarially valued as at 5 April 2005 and this valuation demonstrated the scheme to be 94 per cent funded, with a shortfall of actuarially determined assets to liabilities of six per cent, representing a deficit of 243 million.
The finalisation of the valuation as at 5 April 2005 was accompanied by changes to the basis of funding for the scheme.
For 2006 and future years, deficit funding amounts designed to eliminate the actuarial deficit over a 10-year period have been and are being made.
Total contributions to the scheme for deficit funding and employer contributions for ongoing service for current employees are expected to be of the order of 70 to 75 million per annum over a 10-year period.
However, in 2006, total contributions for the year to 5 April 2006 were 137 million.
This amount reflects the increased level of current contributions for ongoing service and deficit funding backdated to 6 April 2005.
These amounts compared to total contributions in 2005 of 19 million.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Partners, for the valuation of PSPS, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2006 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.
