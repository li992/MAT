TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY For the year ended 30 April 2006 Capital Capital Capital Share Share Redemption Reserve Reserve Revenue Ref.
As previously reported under UK GAAP.
Equity dividend adjustment is due to a change whereby only dividends paid during the year are reflected in the financial statements.
Previously, proposed dividends were shown as a creditor in the financial statements.
The 2004 dividend of 2.25 pence per share is therefore added back and subsequently reflected in the year ended 30 April 2005 results.
c. All investments are now valued on a bid basis.
Previously they were valued on a mid market basis.
d. Previously transaction costs were included within cost of security when purchased and deducted from proceeds of security when sold.
They are now treated as a capital expense.
This results in a movement between realised and unrealised capital reserves.
f. The equity dividend in respect of the year ended 30 April 2005 was paid on 3 October 2005.
