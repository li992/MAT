Pension arrangements and post-retirement healthcare benefits The Group provides both pension fund arrangements and post-retirement medical benefits for its employees.
The Group operates pension schemes in each of its principal locations.
The UK scheme has two plans: a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new employees, and a defined contribution plan.
The defined benefit scheme is funded and its assets are held in a separate fund administered by a corporate trustee.
US$6.5m was charged in the Income Statement in the 2006 financial year in respect of the defined benefit scheme 2005: US$2.0m.
The defined benefit plan was valued using the projected unit credit method with the formal valuation undertaken by professionally qualified and independent actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, as at 31 December 2005.
The actuarial valuation of the assets of the scheme at that date, net of liabilities, was US$8.9m.
The results of the valuation have been updated for any material transactions and material changes in circumstances including changes in market prices and interest rates up to 31 December 2006.
The results of this updated valuation as at 31 December 2006, for the purposes of the additional disclosures required by IAS 19, are set out below.
The post-retirement healthcare benefits are the provision of healthcare to retired employees and their dependants who were employed before 1 January 1998.
Employees who have ten years of service at the age of 58 and retire are eligible to participate in the post-retirement healthcare benefit plans.
The plan is self-funded and there are no plan assets from which the costs are paid.
The cost of providing retiree healthcare is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee group.
Membership of this plan is multi-national, although most staff are currently employed in the United Kingdom.
The obligation under these plans was determined by the application of the terms of medical plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.
The long-term rate of medical expense inflation used in the actuarial calculations is 4.0% per annum in excess of the rate of general price inflation of 3.10% 2005: 4.0% in excess of 2.85%.
The discount rate used in determining the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was 5.10% at 31 December 2006 2005: 4.75%.
The principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and post-retirement healthcare benefits liabilities under IAS 19 are: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 Discount rate 5.10% 4.75% Expected return on plan assets 7.32% 7.31% Future salary increases 5.10% 4.85% Medical cost trend rate 7.10% 6.85% Future pension increases 3.10% 2.85% The mortality assumption has been updated to reflect experience and expected changes in future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy assumptions are as follows: 2006 2005 Number of Number of years years Male current age 65 85.0 84.8 Female current age 65 88.2 87.8 For 2006 mortality has been assumed to follow the standard tables PA92C2006 rated down by one year and with a 0.25% reduction to the discount rate to allow for future mortality improvements which is equivalent to a future improvement in life expectancy of approximately one year in every ten years.
The assets held in respect of the defined benefit scheme and the expected rates of return were: As at 31 December 2006 Long-term Percentage rate of return Value of total expected US$ plan assets % in millions % Equities 7.60 37.0 89.99 a Cash 4.10 Bonds 4.80 4.1 9.98 Fair value of scheme assets 41.1 a 0.03% of the total plan assets are held in cash with a value of US$14,000.
