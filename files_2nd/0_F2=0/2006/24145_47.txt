Intangible assets continued In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is assessed for possible impairment each year.
This assessment takes place in December of each year and compares the carrying value of goodwill for each segment with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been taken to be the segments calculated value in use.
There has been no goodwill impairment charge in 2006 2005: nil.
The value in use for UK Life & Pensions and Lombard has been taken from their business plans.
These projections reflect the long-term nature of the business and forecast the cash flows over the anticipated terms of the policies.
The plans include forecast sales of new business for three years and other assumptions that take into account both past experience and market conditions.
The key assumptions to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive are set out below: Investment market conditions: the plans assume modest investment growth.
Policy lapses: the plans assume no change from recent experience.
Sales and margins: the plans assume a modest reduction in margins but an increasing level of sales.
Expenses: the plans assume that expenses will broadly increase in line with inflation.
Discount rate: the discount rate applied to UK Life & Pensions is 8.0% and to Lombard is 7.2%.
The outcome of the impairment assessment has been that it is considered unlikely that goodwill in respect of UK Life & Pensions would be impaired given that the value in use is significantly higher than the carrying value of goodwill.
The UK Life & Pensions segment is operated as a single group and so a single value in use has been prepared.
For Lombard, acquired in January 2005, the levels of new business have indicated that there is no requirement for any impairment of goodwill.
No goodwill has been allocated to FPI.
For the Asset Management segment, the value in use is calculated using a cash flow projection based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the Board of F&C Asset Management plc.
The Asset Management segment is operated as a single group and so a single value in use has been prepared.
Sales and margins: the plans assume modest sales and margin growth although operating margins have been capped as a measure of prudence.
Expenses: the plans assume cost growth in excess of inflation recognising the impact of staff costs.
Discount rate: the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.9% based on F&Cs weighted average cost of capital.
The outcome of the impairment review is that there is no requirement for any impairment of goodwill in the Asset Management segment.
In addition, the fair value of the Groups holding in F&C, at 31 December 2006, based on the quoted bid price of F&Cs listed ordinary shares was 531m 2005: 441m.
This was in excess of the carrying value of the Groups holding in the Asset Management business at this date.
b Acquired PVIF Acquired PVIF is amortised over the lifetime of the in-force policies and is analysed as follows: 2006 2005 Cumulative Cumulative Cost amortisation Net Cost amortisation Net m m m m m m UK Life & Pensions 184 100 84 187 91 96 International Life & Pensions 296 40 256 297 24 273 Total acquired PVIF 480 140 340 484 115 369 Acquired PVIF has been assessed for possible impairment and there is no indication that it has been impaired.
c Investment management contracts Investment management contracts relate to the Asset Management segment and are amortised over their expected useful economic lives of between 10 and 20 years until 30 June 2006, and between 6 and 20 years from 1 July 2006 until 31 December 2006.

Intangible assets continued As indicated in 2005, Resolution plc withdrew the majority of its assets in the first half of 2006.
The agreed compensation of 27m received from Resolution during the period has been recognised as proceeds in respect of the deemed disposal of intangible assets.
The cost, with respect to the original valuation, of the assets disposed of was 43m and the related cumulative amortisation amounted to 16m.
Therefore the carrying value of the disposed asset equalled the proceeds received giving rise to neither a gain or a loss.
During 2006 the business continued to experience a level of fund outflows which was higher than anticipated.
This level of lost business will have notable impact on revenues and was significant enough to be considered an indicator of potential impairment of certain intangible assets, namely the related investment management contracts.
In accordance with IAS 36, a full impairment review of these assets was undertaken.
The review resulted in an impairment being recognised included within Administrative and other expenses in the income statement in respect of investment management contracts as follows: 2006 2005 m m F&C Investment Trust contracts 22 56 F&C Institutional contracts 36 56 Total impairment recognised in the income statement 58 112 The above contracts relate to the investment trust management contracts and institutional fund management contracts acquired as a result of the creation of F&C Asset Management plc following the business combination of ISIS Asset Management plc and F&C Group Holdings Limited on 11 October 2004.
The recoverable amounts of the assets have been determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the F&C board.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 9.4% 2005: 9.4% for investment trust contracts, 9.4% 2005: 9.4% for institutional contracts with no fixed term and 8.4% 2005: 8.4% for fixed term institutional contracts.
These rates reflect the varying risks and uncertainties inherent in the revenues from the underlying assets, using F&Cs weighted average cost of capital of 8.9%, calculated as at 31 December 2006 31 December 2005: 8.9%, as a benchmark.
Revenues in the projections have been grown at 5.75% 2005: 6% per annum in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, which is consistent with that experienced over the last 16 years across the markets in which the managed assets are invested.
The revenue projections are derived using the estimated useful lives of the underlying contracts and assume a constant loss of revenues over the projection periods.
Costs for the first year of the projections are driven by the budgeted F&C operating margin for 2007.
Thereafter costs are driven by F&Cs projected operating profit, as determined for the purposes of the goodwill impairment review.
Impairment has been determined by comparing the results of the value in use calculations in respect of the remaining contracts at the year end to the carrying value cost less aggregate amortisation and prior impairment of the assets at 31 December 2006, with any deficits arising constituting impairment to be recognised for the year.
The Group continues to monitor the level of investment contracts under management and to assess any impact on the expected lives of the related assets.
Following further business outflows in the second half of the year, the Board revisited the useful life estimates of the affected assets at the year-end and as a result, with effect from 1 January 2007, the remaining life of non-fixed term institutional contracts is now assessed as being 4 years.
The revised useful lives represent a change in the accounting estimate and will accelerate the amortisation of the remaining value of the assets.
The effect of these changes increased the amortisation charge in the second half of 2006 by 1.7m and the charge in future years will be increased by 2.6m per annum compared to continuing to amortise over the lives assigned from 1 July 2006, until such time as the assets become fully amortised.

Intangible assets continued d Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly consist of distribution channel relationships and software development which are amortised over their anticipated useful lives of between 3 and 15 years.
The analysis for each segment is as follows: 2006 2005 Cumulative Cumulative Cost amortisation Net Cost amortisation Net m m m m m m UK Life & Pensions 90 69 21 77 54 23 International Life & Pensions 116 19 97 114 11 103 Asset Management 431 422 Total other intangible assets 210 91 119 195 67 128 Included in amortisation is 7m 2005: 7m in respect of Life & Pensions acquired intangible assets.
Management have assessed other intangible assets for possible impairment and there is no indication that they have been impaired.
