Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recent audited accounts of the investee business.
The figures shown are the total earnings on ordinary activities after tax and net assets of each business.
Because of the varying rights attaching to the classes of shares held by the Group, it could be misleading to attribute a certain proportion of earnings and net assets to the proportion of equity capital held.
