72 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Presentation of Financial Statements Compliance with Applicable Law and IFRS The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and related interpretations.
The Group complies with all IFRS, including those adopted for use in the European Union and those issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million except where otherwise indicated.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Funds IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyper-inflationary Economies Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement: The Fair Value Option IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Conversion to IFRS This is the first year that Vedanta has produced financial statements under IFRS.
This section describes how IFRS has been applied under IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The adoption of IFRS has resulted in a number of significant adjustments to the previously reported results and equity shareholders funds presented under UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
The main changes were in relation to share-based payments, pensions, intangible assets, deferred taxation and financial instruments.
Further details of the conversion to IFRS are provided in note 37.
IFRS 1, First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take some exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
The following Standards have been adopted early by the Group: IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources is applicable to the Group from 1 April 2006.
However, the Group adopted this standard early from 1 April 2004 IFRS 2 Share based payments has been adopted early by the Group from 1 April 2004, for its grant of equity instruments to its employees.
Vedanta has adopted the following key exemptions: Business combinations: Business combinations prior to the transition date 1 April 2004 have not been restated onto an IFRS basis Financial instruments: Financial instruments in the comparative periods presented in the annual report for year ended 31 March 2005, are recorded on the UK GAAP basis applicable in that year, rather than in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Parent Company Financial Statements The financial statements of the parent company, Vedanta Resources plc, have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and with UK accounting presentation.
The Company balance sheet is presented in note 41.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 73 2a.
Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries, being the companies that it controls.
This control is normally evidenced when the Group is able to govern a companys financial and operating policies so as to benefit from its activities or where the Group owns, either directly or indirectly, the majority of a companys equity voting rights unless in exceptional circumstances it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
Adjustments are made to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Revenue Recognition Revenue represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting discounts, volume rebates, outgoing sales taxes and duties, and is recognised usually when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer and the commodity has been delivered to the shipping agent.
Revenues from sale of material by-products are included in revenue.
Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis in the income statement.
Special Items Special items are those that management considers, by virtue of their size or incidence, should be disclosed separately to ensure that the financial information also allows an understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
The determination as to which items should be disclosed separately requires a degree of judgement.
Business Combinations The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Excess purchase consideration, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
Where the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, the surplus is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and leases, that amount is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as mining properties and leases.
Other excess purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
The unamortised balance is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts as at that date, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised.
Investments in Associates In the consolidated financial information, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence and normally owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity but is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above and is included in the carrying value of investments in associate.
The consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of associates results.
The investment is initially recorded at the cost to the Group in the consolidated balance sheet and then, in subsequent periods, the carrying value of investment is adjusted to reflect the Groups share of the associates profits or losses and for impairment of goodwill and any other changes to the associates net assets.
74 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2a.
Accounting Policies continued Property, Plant and Equipment Mining Properties and Leases Exploration and evaluation expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment under the heading Mining properties and leases in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production primary development expenditure other than land, buildings, plant and equipment, etc is capitalised as part of the cost of the mining property until the mining property is capable of commercial production.
Capitalisation of pre-production expenditure ceases when the mining property is capable of commercial production.
From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
Stripping costs secondary development expenditure incurred during the production stage of operations of an ore body are charged to the income statement immediately.
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition subject to meeting the commercial production criteria mentioned above and are subject to impairment review.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves.
Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Other Property, Plant and Equipment The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use.
Expenditure incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are normally charged to the income statement in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Major shut-down and overhaul expenditure is capitalised.
Assets Under Construction Assets under construction are capitalised in the capital work-in-progress account.
Upon completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment assets.
Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset and any obligatory decommissioning costs are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed.
Depreciation Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, and freehold land, are not depreciated.
Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production commences, as described in Property, plant and equipment mining properties and leases.
Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease.
Other buildings, plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Buildings: Operations 30 years Administration 50 years Plant and equipment 1020 years Office equipment and fixtures 320 years Motor vehicles 911 years Major overhaul costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the economic benefit derived from the overhaul.
The carrying amount of the remaining previous overhaul cost is charged to the income statement if the next overhaul is undertaken earlier than the previously estimated life of the economic benefit.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale or which is part of a disposal group held for sale is not depreciated.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less disposal cost and is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 75 2a.
Accounting Policies continued Non-current Assets Held for Sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Impairment The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and investments in associates are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually.
If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the income statement.
The Group reviews the residual value and useful life of an asset at least annually and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change s are accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
For mining properties and leases, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable amount of an asset is determined on the basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life, discounted using a market-based, riskadjusted, discount rate.
For other property, plant and equipment, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net realisable value, where it is possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in an arms length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant cash-generating unit.
Government Grants Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the income statement as and when the related expenditure is incurred.
Inventories Inventories and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following bases: Purchased concentrate is recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: all other materials including stores and spares are valued on weighted average basis Finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity By-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value.
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Taxation Tax expense represents the sum of tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Exceptions to this principle are: Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future Deferred income tax is not recognised on goodwill impairment which is not deductible for tax purposes or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
76 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2a.
Accounting Policies continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant Group entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Retirement Benefit Schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of defined benefit and contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are where funded held in separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined each year separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method by independent qualified actuaries.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are recognised in full in the income statement of the year.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and other postretirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Share-based Payments Certain employees including Directors of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current expectations.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Provisions for Liabilities and Charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement as a borrowing cost.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mine.
Costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to net present value, are provided for and a corresponding amount is capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These costs are charged to the income statement over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
The cost estimates are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to reflect known developments which may have an impact on the cost estimates or life of operations.
The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, changes to lives of operations, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates.
The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the life of the asset to which it relates.
The unwinding of the discount is shown as a financing cost in the income statement.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and charged to the income statement as extraction progresses.
Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be material, they are expensed as incurred.
Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 77 2a.
Accounting Policies continued Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group, is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For all principal subsidiaries, the functional currency is the local currency of the country in which it operates, except KCM, wherein the functional currency is US dollars, since most of its transactions are denominated in US dollars.
In the financial statements of individual group companies, transactions in currencies other than the local functional currency are translated into local currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated into local currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement items of those entities for whom the US dollar is not the reporting currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period.
The related balance sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they hedge the Groups investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
All other exchange differences are included in the income statement.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative exchange differences recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation would be recognised in the income statement.
Financial Asset Investments Quoted financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under IAS 39 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity.
On disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled into the income statement.
Investments in unquoted equity instruments that do not have a market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost.
Equity investments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year.
Liquid Investments Investments maturing after more than 90 days are classified as liquid investments and are fair valued through the income statement.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade Payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Equity Instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in the principal amount.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the income statement using the effective interest method.
They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
78 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2a.
Accounting Policies continued Convertible Loan Notes Convertible loan notes are accounted for as compound instruments.
The equity component and the liability component are separated out on the date of the issue.
The equity component is recognised in a separate reserve and is not subsequently remeasured.
The liability component is held at amortised cost.
The interest expensed on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between this amount and interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan notes.
Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly relating to the financing of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the related asset is substantially ready for its intended use i. e. when it is capable of commercial production.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where surplus funds are available in the short term from money borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from such short-term investments is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average rate applicable to the relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Derivative Financial Instruments In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not hold nor issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses the derivative financial instruments described above to manage exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks.
The policy for accounting for financial instruments from 1 April 2005 is as follows: Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement.
The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the income statement and is offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in equity.
Amounts deferred to equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 79 2b.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimation Uncertainty In the course of applying the policies outlined in note 2 a, management has made estimations and assumptions that impact the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
Vedanta believes that judgement and estimation has been made in the following key areas: Mining Properties and Leases The carrying value of mining properties and leases is determined by depreciating the assets over the life of the respective mine using the unit of production method based on proved and probable reserves.
The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions including life of the mine and may change when new information becomes available.
Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could impact the depreciation rates, asset carrying values and environmental and restoration provisions.
Useful Economic Lives of Assets and Impairment Property, plant and equipment other than mining properties and leases are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the useful economic lives at least once a year and any changes could affect the depreciation rates prospectively and hence the asset carrying values.
The Group also reviews its property, plant and equipment, including mining properties and leases, for possible impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.
In assessing property, plant and equipment for impairment, factors leading to significant reduction in profits such as changes in commodity prices, the Groups business plans and significant downward revision in the estimated mining reserves are taken into consideration.
The carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit CGU and associated mining reserves is compared with the fair value of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Value in use is usually determined on the basis of discounted estimated future cash flows.
This involves management estimate of commodity prices, market demand and supply, economic and regulatory climates, long-term mine plans and other factors.
Any subsequent changes to cash flow due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact on the carrying value of the assets.
Vedanta reported in the last annual report that the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired as part of KCM in November 2004 was being reviewed against their recoverable amounts at the date of acquisition.
This review was completed during the current year and no impairment has been considered necessary to the value of assets acquired.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs Provision is made for costs associated with restoration and rehabilitation of mining sites as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
Such restoration and closure costs are typical of extractive industries and they are normally incurred at the end of the life of the mine.
The costs are estimated on the basis of mine closure plans and the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities.
The costs of restoration are capitalised when incurred reflecting our obligations at that time and corresponding provision is created.
The capitalised asset is charged to the income statement over the life of the asset through depreciation over the life of the operation and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
Management estimates are based on local legislation and or other agreements such as the KCM acquisition agreement.
The actual costs and cash outflows may differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, changes in prices, analysis of site conditions and changes in restoration technology.
The Groups Indian operations do not provide for restoration costs over and above statutory requirements.
In Australia, appropriate provision has been made in accordance with the local legal requirement and in the case of KCM, provisions have been made with reference to a plan agreed with the Government of Zambia at the time of KCMs privatisation in April 2000 and pursuant to the acquisition agreement.
Provisions and Liabilities Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events that can be reasonably estimated.
The timing of recognition requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances which may be subject to change.
The actual cash outflows take place over many years in the future and hence the carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account the changing circumstances and other factors that influence the provisions and liabilities.
80 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2b.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimation Uncertainty continued Contingencies In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group.
Where the potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising or are very difficult to quantify reliably, they are treated as contingent liabilities.
Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the Financial Statements.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the final outcome of the legal proceedings, it is not expected that such contingencies will have a materially adverse impact on the Groups financial position or profitability.
In addition to contingencies, the Group also has significant capital commitments, in relation to various capital projects, which are not recognised on the balance sheet.
The value of such commitments at 31 March 2006 was $1,233.4 million as set out in note 34.
Underlying Earnings and Special Items The financial statements include the presentation of Underlying earnings after adjusting for special items.
This is an additional measure of performance in order to provide a better understanding of the underlying operational results of the Group.
Such special items are generally non-recurring in nature and are disclosed separately in the Financial Statements.
Identification of such items involves a degree of judgement by management.
Segmental Analysis The Groups primary format for segment reporting is business segments.
The business segments consist of non-ferrous metals i. e. aluminium, copper and zinc, with residual components being reported as others.
Business segment data includes an allocation of corporate costs to each sector on an appropriate basis.
The risks and returns of the Groups operations are primarily determined by the nature of the different activities that the Group engages in.
Inter-segment sales are charged based on prevailing market prices.
The Groups activities are organised on a global basis.

There is no concept of tax consolidation or Group relief in India Companies are charged tax on profits of assessment years which run from 1 April to 31 March.
For each assessment year, a companys profits will be subject to either regular income tax or Minimum Alternative Tax MAT, whichever is the greater Regular income tax is charged on book profits prepared under Indian GAAP adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act.
Typically the required adjustments generate significant timing differences in respect of the depreciation of fixed assets, relief for provisions and accruals, the use of tax losses brought forward and pension costs.
Regular income tax is charged at 30% plus surcharges taking the effective tax rate to 33.66%.
The corporate tax rate up to 2004-05 was 35% plus surcharges taking the effective tax rate to 36.59% MAT is charged on book profits but typically with a limited number of adjustments.
MAT is charged at 7.5% plus surcharge.
From the year 2006-07, MAT will be charged at 10% plus surcharge.
However, MAT paid during a year can be set off against normal tax within a period of seven years succeeding the assessment year in which the MAT credit arose There are various tax exemptions or tax holidays available to companies in India.
The most important to the Group are: i the industrial undertakings exemption: Profits of newly constructed industrial undertakings located in designated areas of India can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical tax holiday would exempt 100% of the plants profits for five years, and 30% for the next five years, and ii the power plants exemption: Profits on newly constructed power plants can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical holiday would exempt 100% of profits in ten consecutive years within the first 15 years of the power plants operation.
The start of the ten-year period can be chosen by a company Tax is payable in the financial year to which it relates Tax returns submitted by companies are regularly subjected to a comprehensive review and aggressive challenge by the tax authorities.
There are appeals procedures available to both the tax authorities and taxpayers and it is not uncommon for significant or complex matters in dispute to remain outstanding for several years before they are finally resolved in the High Court or the Supreme Court.

Convertible Bonds VFJL issued $725 million 4.6% guaranteed convertible bonds on 21 February 2006.
The bonds are first convertible into exchangeable redeemable preference shares to be issued by VFJL, which will then be automatically exchanged for ordinary shares of Vedanta Resources plc represented by depository receipts.
Depository receipts do not carry voting rights.
The bondholders have the option to convert at any time from 3 May 2006 to 15 February 2026.
The loan notes are convertible at a fixed price of 14.54 per share and exchange rate of USD:GBP of 1.7845.
If the notes have not been converted, they will be redeemed at the option of the issuer on or at any time after 14 March 2009 and on or prior to 15 February 2026, subject to the conditions as part of the issue.
Additionally the bonds can be redeemed at the option of the bondholder on 21 February 2013, 21 February 2018 and 21 February 2022.
At issue, the net proceeds of the convertible bonds were split between a liability component and an embedded derivative component representing the conversion option.
Following changes to the contractual terms of the bond prior to the balance sheet date, the fair value of the embedded option to convert has been classified as equity on the grounds of meeting the required definition under IAS 32.

VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 95 26.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39, prospectively from 1 April 2005.
The fair values of all derivatives are separately recorded on the balance sheet within other financial assets derivatives and other financial liabilities derivatives, current and non-current.
Derivatives that are designated as hedges are classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.
Derivatives, Financial Instruments and Risk Management The Group uses derivative instruments as part of its management of exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The use of derivatives can give rise to credit and market risk.
The Group controls credit risk by only entering into contracts with first class banks.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management.
The limits, authorities and monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by management and the Board.
The market risk on derivatives is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management purposes.
Foreign Exchange Risk The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, options and other derivatives to hedge the effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The sources of foreign exchange risk are outstanding amounts payable for imported raw materials, capital goods and other supplies as well as financing transactions, loans and current asset investments denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk on its exports.
Most of these transactions are denominated in US dollars.
The Group determines on a regular basis what portion of the foreign exchange risk on financing transactions, loans and current asset investments are to be hedged through forward exchange contracts and other instruments.
There are systems in place for the review of open i. e. unhedged exposure limits and stop-loss levels by management.
The foreign currency exposure of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 22.
Interest Rate Risk The short-term debt of the Group is principally denominated in Indian rupees with fixed rates of interest.
The long-term debt is principally denominated in US dollars and Indian rupees.
The dollar debt is split between fixed and floating rates linked to six month US dollar LIBOR and the Indian rupee debt is principally at fixed interest rates.
The Group has a policy of selectively using interest rate swaps, option contracts and other derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
These exposures are reviewed by appropriate levels of management on a monthly basis.
The interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 22.
Counterparty and Concentration of Credit Risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of receivables, liquid investments and derivative financial instruments.
There is no concentration of credit risk among the receivables of the Group given the large number of receivables and the business diversity.
Credit risk on receivables is very limited as almost all credit sales are against letters of credit of first-class banks.
In respect of current asset investments, counterparty limits are in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
For derivative and financial instruments, the credit risk is limited as the Group only deals with first class banks.
These exposures are further reduced by having standard ISDA Master agreements including set-off provisions with each counterparty.
Commodity Price Risk The Group is conservative in the use of derivatives for commodity hedging.
As much as possible, the Group tries to mitigate price risk through favourable contractual terms.
Moreover, hedging is used primarily as a risk management tool and, in some cases, to secure future cash flows in case of high volatility by entering into forward contracts or similar instruments.
Aluminium The raw material is mined in India with sales prices linked to the London Metal Exchange LME prices.
Currently, we do not undertake any hedging activities in the Aluminium Business.
Copper Copper smelting operations at Tuticorin benefit from a natural hedge created by matching quotational periods for concentrate purchases with timing of finished metal sales.
The balance, the free metal being the difference between payable metal and recovery, and the previous metal content, are sometimes hedged through forward contracts or options.
For the mining assets in Australia and Zambia, part of the production has been hedged to secure cash flows on a selective basis.
Zinc and Lead Raw material is mined in India with sales prices linked to the LME prices.
Currently a part of exports out of India is hedged through forward contracts or other instruments.
Embedded Derivatives Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other contracts are treated as separate derivative contracts, when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts.
96 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 26.
Derivative Financial Instruments continued Cash Flow Hedges The Group also enters into forward exchange and commodity price contracts for hedging highly probable forecast transactions and accounts for them as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the income statement.
The fair value of the Groups open derivative positions at 31 March 2006 excluding normal purchase and sale contracts, recorded within other financial assets derivatives and other financial liabilities derivatives is as follows: Liability Asset $ million $ million Current Cash flow hedges: Commodity contracts 75.0 2.3 Forward foreign currency contracts 0.4 0.1 Interest rate swap floating to fixed 0.9 Fair value hedges: Commodity contracts 4.4 9.7 Forward foreign currency contracts 0.8 0.1 Other 2.0 Non-qualifying hedges: Commodity contracts 22.4 28.7 Forward foreign currency contracts 10.4 2.3 Interest rate swaps fixed to floating 2.9 Other 1.3 Total 114.7 49.0 Non-current Fair value hedges 30.2 Other 63.2 63.2 Total 93.4 63.2 Total derivatives 208.1 112.2 Cash Flow Hedges The majority of cash flow hedges taken by the Group during the year comprise strategic forward sales of copper by KCM to secure against the volatile movement in LME copper prices.
Non-qualifying Hedges The majority of these derivatives comprise copper sale and purchase contracts at Sterlite which are economic hedges but which do not fulfil the requirements of IAS 39.
Non-current The fair value hedges relate to the interest rate swaps fixed to floating taken out by the Group to hedge the interest rate risk on the $600 million bonds due in 2010.
Other relates to the fair value of US dollar: Japanese yen cross-currency swaps with a maturity of 2010.
Equal and opposite swaps are held in two Group companies, such that no exposure to the Group arises.

Deferred Tax The Group has accrued significant amounts of deferred tax.
The majority of the deferred tax liability represents accelerated tax relief for the depreciation of capital expenditure and the depreciation on mining reserves, net of losses carried forward by BALCO and MALCO.
The majority of the deferred tax asset represents tax losses and deferred tax arising on the fair value of cash flow hedges at KCM.
No benefit has been recognised for tax losses of IFL, VRHL and the Company on the grounds that their successful application against future profits is not probable in the foreseeable future.
The amounts of deferred taxation and timing differences, provided and not provided, in the accounts are as follows: As at As at 31 March 2006 31 March 2005 Provided liabilities assets $ million $ million Accelerated capital allowances 300.0 239.7 Unutilised tax losses 134.1 159.7 Other timing differences 49.1 64.9 Total 215.0 144.9 Recognised as: Deferred tax liability provided 286.9 234.9 Deferred tax asset recognised 71.9 90.0 As at As at 31 March 2006 31 March 2005 Not provided liabilities assets $ million $ million Unutilised tax losses 5.1 2.6 Total 5.1 2.6 98 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 28.

Share Based Payments Employee Share Schemes The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of at risk remuneration for Executive Directors.
Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on Listing.
The Board has no present intention to introduce any further share schemes.
The Vedanta Resources Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP The LTIP is the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives are provided to the Executive Directors and the wider management group.
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 100% of annual salary.
In respect of Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kuldip Kaura, salary means the aggregate of their salary payable by Vedanta and their Cost to Company payable by Sterlite.
The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of the wider management group is calculated by reference to the balance of basic salary and share-based remuneration consistent with local market practice.
The performance condition attaching to outstanding awards under the LTIP is that the Companys performance, measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return TSR being the movement in a companys share price plus reinvested dividends, is compared over a three-year period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme from the date of grant.
The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Companys TSR rank against the Adapted Comparator Group at the end of the three-year performance period.
The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.
Vedantas TSR Performance against Adapted Comparator Group % of Award Vesting Below median At median 40 At or above upper quartile 100 The performance condition will be measured by taking the Companys TSR over the four weeks immediately preceding the date of grant and over the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the three-year performance period, and comparing its performance with that of the comparator group described above.
The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration Committee the Committee will be provided by the Companys advisers.
The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Companys total return has out performed the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of the Executive Directors and the wider management group with those of the shareholders.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 99 29.
Share Based Payments continued Vedantas TSR Performance against Adapted Comparator Group continued No awards will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance reasonably reflects the Companys underlying financial performance.
Initial awards under the LTIP were granted on 26 February 2004 with further awards being made on 11 June 2004, 23 November 2004 and 1 February 2006.
The exercise price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the performance period of each award is three years, with no re-testing being allowed.
The exercise period is six months from the date of vesting.
Further details on the LTIP are found in the Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 62.
The fair value of these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions.
This fair value, adjusted by the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using the Monte Carlo Simulation with suitable modifications to allow for specific performance conditions of the LTIP.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends and risk free rate of interest.
A progressive dividend growth policy is assumed in all fair value calculations.
In the absence of sufficient historic data the expected volatility has been estimated from historic volatilities of other similar companies, together with the limited historical data of the Group.
The assumptions used in the calculations of the charge in respect of the LTIP awards granted during the year are set out below: LTIP February 2006 Date of grant 1 February 2006 Number of instruments 2,506,350 Exercise price $0.1 Share price at the date of grant 9.89 Contractual life 3 years Expected volatility 32.1% Expected option life 3.5 years Risk free interest rate 4.3% Expected departures 13.5% Fair value per option granted 4.828 The Vedanta Resources Reward Plan The Reward Plan The Reward Plan was adopted for the purpose of rewarding 43 employees none of whom were Executive Directors at the time of the Group who had contributed to the Companys development and growth over the period leading up to Listing.
It was used solely to provide awards on Listing and no further awards will be granted under the Reward Plan.
Under the Reward Plan, awards were made in respect of 776,000 shares on 26 February 2004 and vested in two instalments.
The first half of the award vested immediately and the shares were issued on 31 March 2004.
The other half of the award, vested on the first anniversary of the date of award subject generally to the employees continued employment at that date.
Consequently a total of 388,000 shares were issued on 18 March 2005 and 31 March 2005.
Awards made under the Reward Plan are not subject to performance conditions as these were considered to be rewards for past service rather than incentives for future performance.
The Vedanta Resources Share Option Plan the Share Option Plan The Share Option Plan was adopted to provide maximum flexibility in the design of incentive arrangements over the long term.
However, at this stage, it is not intended that share options will be granted in the foreseeable future under the Share Option Plan.

Retirement Benefits The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia and Zambia.
a Defined Contribution Schemes Indian Pension Schemes Central Provident Fund The Central Provident Fund relates to all full-time Indian employees of the Group.
The amount contributed by the Group is calculated as 12% of basic salary less contributions made as part of the Pension Fund see below, together with an additional contribution of 12% of basic salary made by the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to senior executives.
Each relevant company holds a policy with the Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC, to which each company contributes a fixed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required, taking into consideration the number of years of service of the executive, and the contributions made.
Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
Pension Fund The Pension Fund was established in 1998 and is managed by the Government.
The employee makes no contribution to this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of basic salary each month subject to a specified ceiling per employee.
This must be provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of superannuation, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contributions through the years, and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level.
The Government funds these payments, thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the central fund is in surplus or deficit.
Australian Pension Schemes The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes in Australia.
The contribution of a proportion of an employees salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia.
The employer contributes, into the employees fund of choice, 9% of the employees gross remuneration where the employee is covered by the industrial agreement and 12% of the basic remuneration for all other employees.
All employees have the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
Zambian Pension Schemes The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full-time permanent employees of KCM subject to the fulfilment of certain eligibility criteria.
The management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives of the employer and the members.
The employer makes a monthly contribution to the KCM Pension Scheme of an amount equal to 11% of that months pensionable salary and the member makes monthly contributions to the fund of an amount equal to 5% of that months pensionable salary.
All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member attains normal retirement age of 55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is permanently medically incapable of performing duties in the service of the employer.
Upon such cessation of contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or being rendered medically incapable of performing duties, or early voluntary retirement within five years to retirement, the member is entitled to receive an immediate annual pension equal to his accrued pension.
The member is allowed to commute his her accrued pension subject to certain rules and regulations.
The trustees of the KCM Pension Scheme may also allow the purchase of an annuity for the benefit of members from a life assurance company or other providers of annuities, subject to statutory regulations.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the KCM Pension Scheme is in surplus or deficit.
b Defined Benefit Schemes India The Gratuity schemes are defined benefit schemes which are open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of five years of service with their employing company.
These schemes are funded by the Group, either through cash contributions or provisions each year, based on actuarial valuations.
Under these schemes, benefits are provided based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds and a full actuarial valuation of the schemes is carried out on an annual basis.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 101 30.
Retirement Benefits continued KCM Specified permanent employees of KCM are entitled to receive medical and retirement severance benefits.
This comprises two months basic pay for every completed year of service with the earliest service start date being 1 July 2004.
Under this scheme, benefits are provided based on final pensionable pay and the full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out on an annual basis.
The accruals are not contributed to any fund and are in the form of provisions in KCMs accounts.
On the death of an employee during service, a lump sum amount is paid to his dependants.
This amount is equal to 60 months basic pay for employees who joined before 1 April 2000 and 30 months basic pay for employees who joined on or after 1 April 2000.
For fixed term contract employees the benefit payable on death is 30 months basic pay.
These schemes are accounted for as a defined benefit scheme and the main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 25% per annum and an annual salary increase of 20%.
c Pension Schemes existing within Group Companies As at 31 March 2006, membership of pension schemes across MALCO, BALCO, HZL, VAL and KCM stood at 21,950 employees 31 March 2005: 20,868.
The deficits, principal actuarial assumptions and other aspects of these schemes are disclosed in further detail in notes d and e below.
MALCO MALCO does not contribute to the LIC.
Its Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a defined benefit basis.
The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2006 using the projected unit actuarial method.
At that date the fund was in deficit.
BALCO At BALCO, all employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2009 are covered by the LIC and their remaining contributions have been made and have been accounted for on a defined contribution basis.
The scheme is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2009, who are not covered by the LIC.
Provision is made in the books based on the latest actuarial valuation which was performed as at 31 March 2006 using the projected unit actuarial method.
HZL HZL contributes to the LIC but the policy does not cover the full liability of the Gratuity scheme.
HZLs Gratuity scheme is therefore accounted for on a defined benefit basis.
VAL VAL does not contribute to the LIC.
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Scheme are determined by actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date and as per gratuity regulations for the company.

32. Business Combinations a Konkola Copper Mines PLC On 5 November 2004, the Group completed the acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in KCM, a company incorporated in the Republic of Zambia.
On acquisition, the fair values of the assets and liabilities included in the Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005, were provisional and were to be finalised within 12 months of acquisition.
During the current year, the Group has completed the fair valuation of the assets and liabilities, and no adjustments to the earlier valuation of net assets on acquisition have been considered necessary.
b Conversion of Sterlite Bonds Sterlite had foreign currency convertible bonds in issue which became convertible on 4 December 2003.
In the period from 4 December 2003 to 31 March 2006, the total bonds issued were converted into ordinary shares in Sterlite which diluted the Groups Economic Interest in Sterlite by 2.9%.
c Deconsolidation of the Sterlite Employee Welfare Trust Until 28 March 2006, Sterlite operated the Sterlite Employee Welfare Trust SEWT, a long term investment plan, the activities of which included granting share options in Sterlite for its senior management.
The SEWT was previously consolidated into the Group accounts by virtue of its status as an ESOP Trust controlled by the Group.
Until 31 March 2004, the SEWTs investments in ordinary shares of Sterlite were disclosed as fixed asset investments in the UK GAAP accounts.
From 1 April 2004, under IFRS and UK GAAP, the ordinary shares of Sterlite were treated as cancelled, which had the effect of increasing Vedantas economic interest in Sterlite.
On 28 March 2006, the trustees reviewed the objectives of the SEWT subsequent to the announcement of the LTIP and decided to amend its objectives to exclude share option plans for Sterlite employees and to include social and charitable activities.
Vedanta reviewed the treatment of the SEWT under IFRS and concluded that by virtue of the change in its objectives it ceased to represent an ESOP Trust.
Moreover, the SEWT is no longer controlled by the Group and now represents an independent entity.
It therefore does not qualify for consolidation in Vedantas Group accounts.
Deconsolidation of the SEWT results in a reduction in the Groups effective shareholding in Sterlite by 2.49% to 75.93%.
At 28 March 2006, being the date of deconsolidation, the net assets of the Group reduced by US$58.7 million, comprising a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $19.5 million and an increase in borrowings of $39.2 million.
Equity shareholders funds reduced by $88.2 million and minority interests increased by US$29.5 million.

This claim has arisen since the commissioning of MALCOs captive power plant in 1999.

Reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS continued b Reconciliation of Profit for the Year from UK GAAP to IFRS excluding IAS 32 39 continued The major differences between UK GAAP and IFRS, as applicable to Vedanta, are described below.
IAS 1 Reclassification of UK GAAP Minority Interests Within Equity Minority interests were reclassified from long-term liabilities to equity in accordance with IAS 1.
Although this increased reported net assets by $636.2 million at 31 March 2005 and $367.0 million at 1 April 2004, it has no impact on total shareholders equity.
IFRS 1 Negative Goodwill Opening negative goodwill of $8.6 million has been credited to reserves and negative goodwill arising during the year 2004-05, amounting to $56.5 million on acquisition of Konkola Copper Mines, has been credited to the income statement.
IFRS 1 Reversal of Goodwill Amortisation The systematic amortisation of goodwill under UK GAAP, by an annual charge to the profit and loss account, has ceased under IFRS.
It has been replaced by annual impairment reviews of the carrying value of goodwill.
Impairment charges relating to goodwill may occur in future reporting periods, due to the finite life of the associated ore body and variation of commodity prices.
The impact on profit for the year in 2004-05 of the reversal of the goodwill amortisation charge under UK GAAP was $0.4 million.
The reversal of negative goodwill has resulted in an adjustment to the UK GAAP balance sheet at 31 March 2005 of $8.5 million.
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments Under UK GAAP, the estimated cost of employee share awards made by the Group is charged to the profit and loss account over the relevant performance period.
IFRS requires the economic cost of share option plans to be recognised by reference to fair value on the grant date, and charged to the income statement over the expected vesting period.
Under IFRS, the additional charge in 2004-05 was $2.5 million.
IAS 19 Post-Retirement Benefits Under UK GAAP, the Group applied SSAP 24, Accounting for Pension Costs under which post retirement benefit surpluses and deficits were spread over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant, current employees.
Under IAS 19 the basis of calculating the surplus or deficit differs from SSAP 24.
In addition, IAS 19 permits three alternative ways in which the surplus or deficit can be recognised.
The Group has chosen to recognise actuarial gains and losses directly in shareholders equity via the Statement of Changes in Equity as at date of adoption of IFRS and going forward to expense the full annual cost as per the actuarial valuation of the Groups post-retirement benefit plans.
The impact on retained earnings on the date of adoption of IFRS i. e. as at 1 April 2004 was a $6.6 million reduction due to the charge for post-retirement benefits as per IAS 19.
IAS 12 Deferred Tax UK GAAP follows the income statement method of tax effect accounting where as IFRS requires deferred tax to be based on a balance sheet liability method.
Temporary differences are recognised as the differences between the tax base of the asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet.
UK GAAP requires the recognition of deferred tax on all fair value adjustments to monetary items and on fair value adjustments which reduce the carrying value of non-monetary items.
IFRS requires deferred tax to be recognised on all fair value adjustments, other than those recorded as goodwill.
IFRS profit for the year will therefore benefit as the additional deferred tax provisions on upward revaluations of non-monetary items are released to the income statement in line with the amortisation of the related fair value adjustments.
112 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 37.
Reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS continued b Reconciliation of Profit for the Year from UK GAAP to IFRS excluding IAS 32 39 continued For future acquisitions, these additional deferred tax provisions will be offset by increases to the value of goodwill or other acquired assets.
For acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004, the increase in provisions has been reflected as a reduction in opening shareholders equity.
The impact on IFRS Profit for the year for 2004-05 was a reduction of $10.6 million.
At 31 March 2005, the IFRS balance sheet includes additional provisions of $88.6 million relating to deferred tax on fair value adjustments for prior year acquisitions.
IAS 10 Dividends Under IFRS, dividends that do not represent a present obligation at the reporting date are not included in the balance sheet.
Hence, the Companys proposed dividends are not recognised in the Group accounts until the period in which they are declared by the Directors.
This has no effect on Profit for the year or Underlying Earnings, but increases shareholders equity at 31 March 2005 by $33.1 million 31 March 2004: $15.8 million.
IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group has elected to adopt IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 April 2005 with no restatement of comparative information.
The financial information for 31 March 2005 does not therefore incorporate the effect of these Standards and is therefore presented under UK GAAP.
Investments Under IFRS, all investments have been carried at market value and consequently any notional gain or loss has been taken to revenue reserve, until disposal: these investments were held at cost under UK GAAP.
The net impact of this adjustment at 1 April 2005 is $1.3 million to the opening shareholders equity see note 38.
Mark-to-Market of Derivative Contracts It remains the Groups policy generally to hedge the ongoing exposures, arising on account of fluctuations in exchange rates, prices or interest rates.
All derivative contracts are marked-to-market and the mark-to-market difference for all hedges, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, are immediately recognised in the income statement.
The mark-to market difference for all qualifying fair value hedges is taken to the income statement and the mark-to-market differences for all qualifying cash flow hedges are recognised in the balance sheet and released to the income statement upon the occurrence of the underlying transaction.
At 1 April 2005, the marked-tomarket value of derivative contracts, under IFRS decreased shareholders equity by $13.4 million see note 38.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 113 38.
Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group elected not to restate its comparative information for IAS 32 and IAS 39 and adopted the Standards prospectively from 1 April 2005.
The consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2005 has been adjusted to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 1 April 2005 as set out below: At IAS 32 39 At 31 March 2005 adjustments 1 April 2005 $ million $ million $ million Assets Non-current assets Goodwill 12.2 12.2 Property, plant and equipment 2,288.6 2,288.6 Investment in associate 3.3 3.3 Financial asset investments 24.8 1.3 26.1 Other non-current assets 34.6 12.4 22.2 Other financial assets derivatives 12.4 12.4 Deferred tax asset 90.0 90.0 2,453.5 1.3 2,454.8 Current assets Inventories 337.7 337.7 Trade and other receivables 339.6 339.6 Other current financial assets derivatives 2.5 2.5 Liquid investments 262.0 262.0 Cash and cash equivalents 1,185.6 1.0 1,186.6 2,124.9 3.5 2,128.4 Total assets 4,578.4 4.8 4,583.2 Current liabilities Short-term borrowings 194.7 194.7 Convertible loan notes 23.7 5.4 18.3 Trade and other payables 675.0 3.2 671.8 Other current financial liabilities derivatives 38.7 38.7 Provisions 37.0 37.0 Current tax liabilities 15.1 15.1 945.5 30.1 975.6 Net current assets liabilities 1,179.4 26.6 1,152.8 Non-current liabilities Medium and long-term borrowings 1,303.5 15.8 1,287.7 Trade and other payables 41.2 18.6 22.6 Other financial liabilities derivatives 29.9 29.9 Deferred tax liabilities 234.9 6.6 228.3 Retirement benefits 38.6 38.6 Provisions 208.6 208.6 Non equity minority interests 59.4 59.4 1,886.2 11.1 1,875.1 Total liabilities 2,831.7 19.0 2,850.7 Net assets 1,746.7 14.2 1,732.5 Equity Equity share capital 28.7 28.7 Share-based payment reserve 2.5 2.5 Share premium account 18.6 18.6 Other reserves 43.9 0.9 44.8 Hedging reserves 3.2 3.2 Retained earnings 1,016.8 9.8 1,007.0 Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 1,110.5 12.1 1,098.4 Minority interest 636.2 2.1 634.1 Total equity 1,746.7 14.2 1,732.5 The IFRS news release issued on 27 September 2005 sets out the detailed accounting policies for the Groups financial instruments and reconciliation by adjustment type on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
114 VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 38.
Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 continued The key changes in accounting policy on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 are: recognition and fair value of derivatives: fair value of investments that were previously accounted for at cost: and the separation of the equity conversion option within convertible debt instruments.
A summary of the more significant adjustments is set out below: 1.
All outstanding derivatives are now recognised on the balance sheet at their mark-to-market value and are disclosed within Other financial assets derivatives or Other financial liabilities derivatives 2.
The decrease in borrowings and liabilities i. e. $27 million is largely due to the separate presentation of derivatives within Other financial assets derivatives and Other financial liabilities derivatives 3.
Derivative financial instruments that were designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows as at 1 April 2005 were fair valued through the hedging reserve at that date.
Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges as at 1 April 2005 were fair valued through retained earnings 4.
The conversion option within the convertible bond issued by Sterlite was fair valued at the date of issue and is included in equity, net of deferred tax.
