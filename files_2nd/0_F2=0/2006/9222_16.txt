4 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent Company Ladbrokes plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.

Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 63 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment and as such, is stated at cost less any provision for impairment of value.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and those acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
The costs relating to internally generated intangible assets, principally software costs, are capitalised if the criteria for recognition as assets are met.
Other expenditure is charged against profit in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Where amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives, this expense is taken to the income statement through the depreciation and amounts written off non current assets line item.
Useful lives are also reviewed on an annual basis.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
A summary of the policies applied to the Groups intangible assets is as follows: Management Licences Software Key money Brand contracts Useful lives indefinite finite finite indefinite finite Method used not depreciated 3-5 years 10 years not depreciated 30 years or revalued straight line straight line or revalued straight line Internally generated acquired acquired and acquired acquired acquired or acquired internally generated Impairment testing annually and where amortisation method amortisation method annually and where amortisation method recoverable amount an indicator of reviewed at each reviewed at each an indicator of reviewed at each testing impairment exists financial year end financial year end impairment exists financial year end discontinued operations An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal, with any gain or loss Property, plant and equipment arising calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Land and buildings are also measured at cost less the carrying amount of the item included in the income statement in the year accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: buildings 50 years or estimated useful life of the building or lease, whichever is less, to estimated residual value: plant, vehicles and equipment four to 25 years as considered appropriate to write down cost to estimated residual value.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 67 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Future accounting developments IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures supersedes IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, adding certain new disclosures about financial instruments to those currently required by IAS 32, with the remaining parts of IAS 32 dealing only with financial instruments presentation matters.
Under the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7, financial instruments should be grouped into classes of similar instruments and the required disclosures made by class.
The two main categories of disclosures required by IFRS 7 are: information about the significance of financial instruments and information about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments.
The new disclosures on market risk include a sensitivity analysis of each type of market risk to which the Group is exposed.
IFRS 7 provides that if the Group prepares a sensitivity analysis for management purposes that reflects interdependencies of more than one component of market risk for example, interest risk and foreign currency risk combined, it may disclose that analysis instead of separate sensitivity analysis for each type of market risk.
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 7 for the year ending 31 December 2007 and is currently assessing the impact this will have.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and in doing so, requires an entity to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments, having identified operating segments based on internal reports regularly reviewed by the entitys chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.
Descriptive information about the way that the operating segments were determined and the products and services provided by the segments should be given: any change across reporting periods to the basis of measurement of segment amounts should be stated and an explanation of how segment profit or loss and segment assets are measured for each reportable segment should be provided.
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 8 for the year ending 31 December 2009 and is currently assessing the impact this will have.
The Group will apply the guidance under IFRIC10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment, which concludes that where an entity has recognised an impairment loss in an interim period in respect of goodwill or an investment in either an equity instrument or a financial asset carried at cost, that impairment should not be reversed in subsequent interim financial statements nor in annual financial statements, to reporting periods beginning 1 January 2007.
There are no other IFRICs in issue but not yet effective that will have a significant impact for the Group.

Eligibility for benefits is normally determined primarily according to an employees length of service and level of responsibility.
The amounts of some benefits are proportionate to individual salary.
Benefits may include paid leave for holidays, maternity and illness, as well as insured benefits.
The latter can cover private healthcare for the employee and their immediate family, long term disability, personal accident and death in service cover.
Company cars, including fuel benefits, are provided predominantly to meet job requirements but also to certain executives.
The principal benefit schemes are: i Pensions A number of pension schemes were operated by the Group prior to the disposal of the hotels division.
Schemes reflect local conditions and the practices in the countries concerned.
Contributions to the pension schemes by both companies and employees, are held in segregated funds or are insured and are independent of the Groups finances except where, due to local conditions and practices, pensions are not externally secured.
The Company pension arrangements are described on page 92, note 32.
Subsequent to the disposal of the hotels division, the main scheme is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
Membership is optional and there is a separate section for senior executives.
The scheme is contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and is exempt approved by the Inland Revenue.
Accordingly, benefits are restricted by Inland Revenue limits.
Ladbrokes Pension Plan Members contribute on average six per cent of pensionable salary per annum.
Benefit accrues to provide a target pension of two thirds for joiners after June 2002 half of final pensionable salary for an employee attaining age 65 with at least 40 years membership.
A spouses pension is payable following death.
Ladbrokes Pension Plan Senior Executive Plan Members contribute on average eight per cent of pensionable salary per annum.
Benefit accrues to provide a target pension from all sources of two thirds of final pensionable salary for an executive attaining age 60 with at least 20 years membership for joiners after June 2002, employees attaining age 65 with at least 26.7 years service.
A spouses and childrens pensions are payable following death.
Senior executives subject to the Earnings Cap Following the A-Day pensions review, the pre A-Day Revenue limits regime has been maintained as the framework for the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, including the Earnings Cap, which will continue to be increased annually with inflation.
Executive directors and senior executives have a choice between: i membership of the Executive Section of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan plus a cash supplement of 30 per cent or 15 per cent for those offered the supplement on or after 2 January 2005 of base salary above the Earnings Cap: or ii a cash supplement of 30 per cent or 15 per cent for those offered the supplement on or after 2 January 2005 of base salary in lieu of membership of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 73 10 Staff costs continued Prior to 6 April 2006, executive directors and senior executives also had a third option: iii membership of the Executive Section of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, together with membership of the Hilton Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme HUURBS, established to cover base salary above the Earnings Cap.
Those who chose membership of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan and the HUURBS were credited with a HUURBS allocation of 42 per cent or 20 per cent for those offered membership on or after 2 January 2005 of base salary above the Earnings Cap.
The HUURBS has been discontinued with all benefits now paid out to members.
ii Share-based payments Details of employee share schemes operated by the Group are shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 47 which forms part of the Annual Report 2006.
Details of options granted in 2006 and outstanding as at 31 December 2006 are shown on page 95, note 33.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary differences may be deducted.
There are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associated undertakings.

These are not amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons: Ladbrokes is a leading operator in a well established market: there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services and greyhound racing: and existing law acts to restrict entry.
Although licences are required to be renewed every three years for regulatory purposes, Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing all its betting permits and licences at minimal cost.
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
Goodwill relates to the deferred tax liability arising on acquisitions.
Intangible assets included in discontinued operations The brand name comprised the cost attributed to the Hilton International brand name on its acquisition in 1987.
The carrying amount of the brand was determined by discounting the incremental cash flows generated by the brand and was limited to the excess of purchase price over the underlying net assets.
The carrying amount of the brand was maintained through marketing expenditure and development activity and was thus considered to have an indefinite life.
Capitalised goodwill related to the acquisition of Stakis plc in 1999 and the acquisition of Scandic Hotels AB in 2001.
Subsequent to 1 January 2004, goodwill was no longer amortised and was annually tested for impairment.
Management contracts related to the value of the management contract entered into simultaneously on disposal of hotel property.
16 Impairment testing of goodwill and licences The Group tests annually for impairments, or more frequently if there are indications that licences and goodwill might be impaired, by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination: if the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill allocated to that group would be regarded as not impaired.
Goodwill of 44.7 million 2005: 35.4 million relating to the continuing operations is allocated to the cash generating units that comprise the European Retail segment.
Licences have been allocated to the individual European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets.
The carrying value of licences as at 31 December 2006 was 370.9 million 2005: 340.4 million.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.4 per cent 2005: 10.0 per cent and cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using a 2.5 per cent growth rate 2005: 2.5 per cent.
This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The recoverable amount of the European Retail estate is significantly in excess of its carrying amount and there has been no impairment of goodwill or licences in 2006.
When applying sensitivities to these projections, impairments of individual CGUs may be necessary in the future if their recoverable amounts do not exceed their carrying amounts, although this is not expected to be material.
There would need to be a significant change in the cash flow projections or the discount rate before a material impairment charge would be required.

In the first half of 2006, the bondholders exercised their option to convert the bonds into ordinary shares of Ladbrokes plc, according to the terms and conditions of the bonds.
Conversion rights in respect of all convertible bonds had been fully exercised by 5 June 2006.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 85 24 Interest bearing loans and borrowings continued With the adoption of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005, the net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds had been split between the liability element and an equity component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, as follows: 2006 m Nominal value of convertible loan notes issued 300.0 Equity component 34.3 Issue costs 3.3 Liability component at date of issue 262.4 Interest charged 37.1 Interest paid 25.3 Liability component at 31 December 2006 274.2 Issue of ordinary shares on conversion share capital 13.0 Issue of ordinary shares on conversion share premium 287.0 Unamortised discount at conversion 25.8 The interest charged for the period up to conversion was calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 5.56 per cent to the liability component since the loan was issued.
25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates.
The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Groups treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise: bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, convertible bonds, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, such as spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Groups financial risk.
Derivative financial instruments are also used, where appropriate, to generate the desired effective currency and interest rate profile.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group has a 2 billion Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme which is used to increase the flexibility of funding with regards to source, cost, size and maturity.
At 31 December 2006, three public Eurobond issues had been made under this programme: a 175 million 7.25 per cent bond, maturing July 2008: a 500 million 6.5 per cent bond, maturing July 2009 and a 250 million 7.125 per cent bond, maturing July 2012.
Several private placements have been issued under the programme in a variety of currencies.
As at 31 December 2006, these private placements had a carrying value of 34.3 million 2005: 38.2 million.
Funds raised via the EMTN programme have been used to repay bank debt.
In October 2003, the Group issued 300 million 3.375 per cent convertible bonds.
These were due to mature in 2010 but conversion rights in respect of all convertible bonds had been fully exercised by 5 June 2006.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are: interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
The magnitude of this risk that has arisen over the year is discussed in note 26.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 4.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using appropriate derivative financial instruments to maintain it at variable short term interest rates.
At 31 December 2006, after taking account of interest rate and cross currency swaps, none of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed rates 2005: 12 per cent of gross borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 3.7 years and for an annual average interest rate of 6.3 per cent.
Foreign currency risk Due to the change in nature of the Groups core activities, reported profits, net assets and gearing are less affected by foreign exchange movements than in 2005.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure that may arise from the translation of foreign currency assets by implementing net investment hedges in foreign currencies to match at least 50 per cent of foreign currency assets.
Following the disposal of the hotel assets, the Group was left with insignificant foreign currency assets.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had no net investment hedges 2005: net investment hedges represented 47 per cent of the net carrying value of foreign currency assets.
The Group has foreign currency borrowings, including a 500 million bond, that are not net investment hedges which have been swapped into sterling.
The total value of these borrowings as at 31 December 2006 was 384.6 million 2005: nil.
Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises, Group exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal.
The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currencies.
86 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Commodity price risk The Groups exposure to price risk is minimal.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available for sale financial assets and derivative financial instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
This risk is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and to limit the exposure to a maximum per bank.
All derivatives are executed under agreements conforming to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standards.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The Groups policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium and long term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2006, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 555.8 million 2005: 574.1 million.
Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 3.9 years 2005: 3.2 years.
26 Financial instruments Fair values Set out below is an analysis by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.

The fair value of cash at bank and in hand approximates to book value due to its short term maturity.
Trade receivables and payables, other than non current antepost liabilities, have been excluded because the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Other financial assets and liabilities primarily relate to guarantees given to third parties in respect of lease obligations of certain of the Groups former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.
The Group has recognised a financial liability relating to guarantees to third parties given by the parent Company in respect of lease liabilities of subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.
A corresponding financial asset has been recognised which relates to the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation at the time of the disposal in relation to any loss the Group may incur under these guarantees.

Hedging activities Hedge of net investments in foreign operations Following the disposal of the hotels division on 23 February 2006, foreign currency derivative financial instruments and foreign currency borrowings which were designated as part of the Groups net investment hedging structure ceased to qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The Group has continued to hold and enter into foreign currency swaps and cross currency swaps since 23 February 2005 that do not qualify as net investment hedges under IAS 39 but that are economic hedges of the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
The fair value of the Groups cross currency swaps is 2.2 million 2005: 24.9 million, comprising 38.0 million 2005: 442.7 million assets and 35.8 million 2005: 467.6 million liabilities.
The fair value of the Groups foreign currency swaps is a liability of 9.4 million 2005: 9.3 million, comprising 339.4 million 2005: 6.1 million assets and 348.8 million 2005: 13.8 million liabilities.
The fair value of the Groups foreign currency borrowings that were designated as a hedging instrument as at 31 December 2005 was 399.5 million.
Fair value hedge The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its fixed rate borrowings by swapping borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates.
Contracts with nominal values of 666.6 million 2005: 900.6 million have fixed interest receipts at an average rate of 6.46 per cent 2005: 5.8 per cent and have floating interest payments at LIBOR and EURIBOR plus 1.04 per cent 2005: 0.27 per cent.
The contracts are outstanding for periods up until 2012.
The fair value of these swaps as at 31 December 2006 is 11.0 million 2005: 48.8 million.
Cash flow hedge The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its cash flow exposure to interest rate movements on its floating rate SEK300 million Private Placement borrowings by swapping borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Contracts with nominal values of 22.3 million 2005: 21.9 million have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 6.71 per cent for periods up until 3 December 2007 shown as floating rate as maturity in less than one year and have floating interest receipts at STIBOR plus 0.89 per cent.
The fair value of these swaps as at 31 December 2006 is a liability of 0.4 million 2005: 1.3 million and the movement has been deferred in equity.
The period in which the cash flows relating to the cash flow hedge are expected to occur is 2007 and this cash flow hedge is expected to enter the income statement during 2007.

Defined benefit plans Following the disposal of the hotels division, the Groups only significant retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK employees.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Although the Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, professional advisers are appointed to run it.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 1 July 2005.
A funding review, following the disposal of the hotels division, was carried out in 2006.
The results of the actuarial valuations were updated to 31 December 2006 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost has been measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19.
As part of the agreement for the sale of the hotels division, Hilton Hotels Corporation funded 50 per cent of the IAS 19 deficit of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
Hilton Hotels Corporation made this payment into the Ladbrokes Pension Plan on completion of the sale.
To reflect this agreement, 50 per cent of the IAS 19 deficit of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan as at 31 December 2005 was included in discontinued operations note 14.
During 2006, the Ladbrokes Pension Plan transferred assets and liabilities in respect of current and former hotel employees to a pension plan operated by Hilton Hotels Corporation.
In addition, as part of the sale of the hotels division, the Non UK Schemes automatically transferred to Hilton Hotels Corporation.

The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2006 2005 UK Non UK Schemes Schemes Equity instruments % 67.0 75.0 24.0 Debt instruments % 33.0 23.0 18.0 Other % 2.0 58.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date expressed as weighted averages where appropriate : 2006 2005 UK Non UK Schemes Schemes Discount rate % 5.2 4.8 5.0 Expected return on plan assets % 6.5 6.7 5.8 Future salary growth % 5.9 5.6 3.5 Future pension increases % 2.8 2.5 2.2 The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the long term expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes.
The sources used to determine the best estimate of long term returns include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
At 31 December 2006, the long term expected rate of return on equity instruments, debt instruments and other assets was assumed to be 7.5 per cent per annum, 4.5 per cent per annum and 4.3 per cent per annum respectively, for the Plan.
The post retirement mortality assumed is based on the standard PA92 mortality table with medium cohort projection, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 2006 is 85 years for males and 88 years for females.
The deficit of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was eliminated by the special contribution in the year and the Plan was in surplus as at 31 December 2006.
As a result, the fair value of the Plan as at 31 December 2006 was not particularly sensitive to a change of one per cent in any of the underlying assumptions.

The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below and in the Directors Remuneration Report.
All of the plans listed below are equity settled share-based payments.
i Annual bonus compulsory and voluntary deferral into shares Half of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares which vest, subject to continued employment, after two years.
Where a participant has earned a bonus in respect of the bonus year and further Group performance criteria are met, participants may be invited to invest up to 25 per cent of the value of their total bonus in Ladbrokes plc shares which must then be held for three years.
The Group will match any percentage up to the 25 per cent maximum voluntarily invested by a participant.
The matching shares vest after three years, subject to continued employment and the participant continuing to hold the shares purchased by their voluntary investment.
ii Sharesave savings related share option scheme This is a sharesave scheme with options granted at a 20 per cent discount to market value.
The scheme operates with either a three, five or seven years saving the last seven year option was granted in 1999 with vesting after this time.
iii Share incentive plan a Under the OWN plan, employees can contribute up to 75 per month to acquire Ladbrokes plc shares.
For every two shares purchased, the Group provides a match of one additional share.
b An award of Freeshares up to 250 in value is made to participating employees with one years service.
iv Share options The options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period.
Vested options lapse if they have not been exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
All options have an EPS growth based performance condition.
v Performance share plan PSP An award under the PSP consists of a notional allocation of shares which will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, at the end of the three year period.
The performance conditions are set out below.
No dividends are paid to employees during the vesting period nor at the end of the period as dividend equivalents.
January 2003, January 2004 and January 2005 awards The vested January 2003, January 2004 and January 2005 awards had two separate performance conditions: half of the award vested based on Total Shareholder Return TSR and half of the award vested based on return on capital employed for the discontinued hotels division.
The outstanding January 2005 awards shall vest based on operating profit growth for the former Betting and Gaming division.
January 2006 awards The January 2006 awards have two separate performance conditions: half of the award vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on operating profit growth for the former Betting and Gaming division.
For a more detailed description of each of the above options, refer to the Directors Remuneration Report.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 3.83 2005: 3.09.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 94 pence 2005: 72 pence.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2006 is between seven and eight years 2005: between eight and nine years.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding as at the end of the year was 1.42 to 4.22 2005: 1.40 to 3.47.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised expenses of 5.8 million 2005: 6.2 million relating to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
Share awards granted during the year: 2006 2005 Number 812,209 1,988,748 Weighted average fair value 3.40 2.71 The fair value of share awards was measured by calculating the present value of the dividends receivable between the grant date and the vesting date and valuing the market related performance conditions through the use of a closed-form model, similar to a Monte Carlo simulation.
34 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non cancellable operating lease agreements.
These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings.
The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be summarised as follows: Lease terms Shop leases are typically 15 years with a tenant only break clause at 10 years and rent reviews every five years.
Other leases are typically between three and 10 years.
Determination of rent payments Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
Terms of renewal The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been agreed upon and, in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor.
Restrictions There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing lease arrangements, although there were occasionally non financial restrictions on leases preventing the Group from opening or operating another competing hotel for a specified number of years.
Subleases The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.
