EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS Continued Certain income statement and balance sheet items, previously reported under UK GAAP, have been reclassified to comply with the Groups format for reporting under adopted IFRS.
In addition to this, certain other balances have been re-measured by applying the Groups new accounting policies in accordance with adopted IFRS from 1 April 2004.
A description of these accounting changes and their impact on the restated financial statements at 31 March 2005 follows.
Note that, as permitted, IAS 32 and IAS 39 have not been applied to these restatements and instead have been applied from 1 April 2005.
Details on this are included at note 29. i Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is provided on timing differences whereas, under IAS 12 Income Taxes, provision must be made based on temporary differences between carrying values and the related tax base of assets and liabilities, except in certain circumstances.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups policy was to recognise deferred tax on a discounted basis.
Under adopted IFRS, discounting is not permitted and the deferred tax provision has been restated accordingly.
The impact of these changes has been to reduce net assets at 31 March 2005 by 310.7m.
Consequently, an additional charge of 2.6m, for the year to 31 March 2005, has been reflected in the income statements.
ii Current dividend Previously, proposed dividends were recognised in the year in which the profits to which they relate were earned.
IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends should not be accrued until the date at which they are declared.
As the Company normally declares its final dividend after its results are approved by its Board, final dividends are not accrued at the year end.
Consequently, this has the effect of increasing opening net assets at 1 April 2004 by 226.1m and closing net assets at 31 March 2005 by 260.0m.
iii Share based payments Under UK GAAP, Inland Revenue-approved save as you earn schemes, such as SSEs sharesave scheme, did not result in a charge being taken to the profit and loss account.
Other employee share schemes were accounted for on an intrinsic value basis.
Under IFRS 2 Share based payments, all grants of equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value, with an appropriate charge being made to the income statement in the appropriate accounting period.
SSE has elected to adopt the provisions of IFRS 1 which allow first time adopters to apply the rules of IFRS 2 only to options granted after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The Groups employee share schemes have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The impact of this is a credit to the Income Statement of 6.4m, for the year to 31 March 2005. iv Property, plant and equipment The main change for the Group from the adoption of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment relates to the hydro generation infrastructure network.
Under UK GAAP, the hydro generation infrastructure network, including the dams, tunnels and other hydro civil engineering structures, was considered to have an indefinite life and was not subject to depreciation.
Expenditure to maintain the hydro generation civil infrastructure was dealt with using the renewals accounting provisions of FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets.
Under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, renewals accounting is prohibited and all items of property, plant and equipment should be subject to depreciation, with the exception of land.
As a result all aspects of accounting for these assets and expenditures have been amended to be compliant with IFRS.
Consequently, the Group identified the carrying value of the Hydro Civil Assets acquired in 1990 on privatisation and rolled this balance forward for additions and depreciation based on a useful economic life of 100 years.
The overall effect is to increase net assets by 3.4m at 1 April 2004, the date of transition, with an additional net charge of 1.1m in the year ended 31 March 2005 being recognised.
Qualifying expenditure on these assets will be capitalised and depreciated over the useful life of the assets.
v Retirement benefits Under UK GAAP, the Group fully adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits in 2002.
The Groups revised policy is to account for retirement and other benefits in accordance with the revised version of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The method of accounting for pension scheme assets and liabilities, actuarial gains and losses and income and charges associated with such schemes under IAS 19 is very similar to FRS 17 but some notable differences exist.
The main re-measurement change under IAS 19 is the requirement for scheme assets to be valued at a bid price rather than a mid market valuation.
The effect of this change is the net asset balances at 31 March 2005 is lower by 15.8m.
