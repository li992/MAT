The acquired value of the in-force business has been amortised on a basis that reects the expected profit stream arising from the business acquired at the date of acquisition.
This profit stream is estimated from the experienced termination rates, expenses of management and age of the clients under the individual contracts as well as global estimates of investment growth, based on recent experience at the date of acquisition.
