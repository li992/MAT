NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1 CORPORATE INFORMATION The consolidated accounts of National Express Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2006 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 1 March 2007 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by S R Bowker and A C Walker.
National Express Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Operating and Financial Review OFR that accompanies these accounts.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Statement of compliance These accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committees IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union EU, and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group is required to comply with international accounting requirements under IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Information except in extremely rare circumstances where management concludes that compliance would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective to present fairly its accounts.
On this basis, the Group has departed from the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits and has accounted for its constructive but not legal obligations for the Railways Pension Scheme RPS under the terms of its UK rail franchise agreements.
Details of the background and rationale for this departure are provided in note 35, including the impact on the Groups reported financial performance and position of adopting this accounting treatment as required by IAS 1.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available for sale investments detailed below.
As noted above, the Group has taken the extremely rare decision to depart from the requirement of IAS 19 Retirement Benefits so as to present fairly its financial performance, position and cash flows in respect of its obligation for the RPS.
The details of this departure and impact on the Groups accounts are set out in note 35.
A summary of the Groups accounting policies applied in preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006 is set out below.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets including goodwill and measurement of defined benefit pension obligations.
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
This requires estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate see note 14.
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the choice of a suitable discount rate see note 35.
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Adjustments are made to bring any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist into line with the Groups accounting policies.
On acquisition of a business, the purchase method of accounting is adopted, and the Group income statement includes the results of subsidiaries and businesses purchased during the year from the date control is assumed.
Purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
On the sale of a business, the Group income statement includes the results of that business to the date of disposal.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately from parent shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Interests in joint ventures The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures which take the form of agreements to share control of other entities.
The Group recognises its interest in the entitys assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting.
The Group balance sheet includes the appropriate share of these joint ventures net assets and the income statement the appropriate share of their results after tax.
Accounts of jointly controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Adjustments are made in the Groups accounts to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entities.
The Group ceases to use the equity method from the date it no longer has joint control over the entity.
Interests in associates Companies, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of these associates results and reserves based on their latest accounts under the equity method.
Income statement presentation The income statement has been presented in a columnar format to highlight the impact of intangible assets amortisation and exceptional items.
This is to enable users of the financial statements to view the normalised results of the Group.
Normalised results are defined as the statutory results before the following as appropriate: profit or loss on the sale of businesses, exceptional profit or loss on the sale of non-current assets and charges for goodwill impairment, amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and tax relief on qualifying exceptional items.
50 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which due to their nature and infrequency require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.
Revenue recognition Rendering of services Revenue comprises income from road passenger transport, train passenger services, airport operations and related activities in the UK, North America and Europe.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.
UK Trains revenue includes amounts attributed to the train operating companies TOCs, based principally on agreed models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry, in respect of passenger receipts.
In addition, franchise agreement receipts from the Department for Transport Rail Division DfT Rail and local Passenger Transport Executives PTEs are treated as revenue.
Franchise agreement payments to DfT Rail are recognised in operating costs.
UK Coach revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales.
UK Bus and European Coach & Bus Alsa revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local transport authorities, which is recognised as the services are provided.
For all the divisions noted above, the relevant share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred within liabilities and released to the income statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard.
North American Bus revenue from school boards and similar contracts is recognised as the services are provided.
Rental income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest income Revenue is recognised using the effective interest method.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the income statement over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the income statement as the related expenditure is expensed.
Segmental reporting Each of the Groups business and geographical segments provides services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other business segments.
Due to the nature of the Groups operations the distinct business segments align directly with geographical segments which are operating in separate economic environments.
The Groups segments comprise: UK Buses: UK Coaches: UK Trains: North American Bus: European Coach & Bus Alsa : and Central functions.
These segments are described in more detail in the OFR accompanying these accounts.
Operations in our North America Public Transit business was discontinued in 2005.
The net assets of Stewart International Airport are disclosed in disposal group assets classified as held for sale and liabilities disclosed in liabilities directly associated with disposal group assets classified as held for sale reflecting the expected sale of this business in 2007.
Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of lease.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred in accordance with the benchmark accounting treatment under IAS 23 Borrowing Costs.
51 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Current tax and deferred tax Current tax is provided on taxable profits earned according to the local tax rates applicable where the profits are earned.
Income taxes are recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item accounted for in equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in equity.
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes except on the initial recognition of goodwill, where the recognition of an asset or liability does not arise through a business combination or through the recognition of a profit or loss and in respect of investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, are capitalised at cost and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, finite life assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and indefinite life assets are held at historic cost.
The amortisation expense is taken to the income statement through operating expenses.
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer contracts over the life of the contract between 1 and 33 years Right to operate TOC franchises over the life of the franchise between 1 and 7 years Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and the useful lives of finite assets are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, made on a prospective basis.
Finite life assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
The Groups indefinite life intangible assets include customer relationships and goodwill.
Customer relationship intangible assets are recognised only on contracts where historical experience has shown that these contracts are consistently renewed.
Goodwill IFRS 3 Business Combinations, has been applied to the accounting for business combinations from 1 January 2004, as permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at historic cost less any accumulated impairment.
If an acquisition gives rise to an excess of the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the acquirees indentifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost previously referred to as negative goodwill, this is credited immediately to the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations, goodwill is not amortised.
All goodwill is subject to an annual test of impairment and an impairment charge recognised as required.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post acquisition.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on the disposal of the operation.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 the Group has elected to deem the fair value of certain revalued assets to be equivalent to cost.
Land and buildings comprise mainly vehicle depots and garages, and offices.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 30 to 50 years Long leasehold property improvements 15 to 40 years Public service vehicles 8 to 15 years Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 to 15 years The carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
52 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, except for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill which are reviewed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and any previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to assess the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased, subject to a limit of the assets net book value had no previous impairment loss been recognised.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted to allocate the assets revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life.
Impairments to goodwill cannot be reversed.
Financial instruments The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates the designation at each year end.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value.
Financial assets held by the Group include certain derivative contracts and investments in entities that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures.
Available for sale financial assets The Groups investments in entities that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are classified as available for sale financial assets.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Where there is no active market for the Groups investments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flow analyses.
In the absence of any other reliable external information, assets are carried at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts, fuel price swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency, fuel price and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, interest rate and fuel price swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end.
The Groups fuel price swaps and interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are used to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign currency denominated operations and to the extent they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against foreign exchange exposure in the related assets.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
Doubtful debts are provided for when collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written off when identified.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred except where it is virtually certain that a franchise will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the income statement over the life of the franchise.
Costs associated with the commencement of all new contracts other than rail franchises are expensed as incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short-term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost being the net fair value of the consideration received plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial asset or liability.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a FIFO basis, after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
53 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a pre-tax discount rate.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers.
The insurance provision is based on estimated exposures at the year end principally for claims arising in the UK and North America prior to the year end date, subject to the overall stop loss within the Groups insurance arrangements.
The majority of provisions will be utilised within six years, and the provision has been discounted to take account of the expected timing of future cash settlements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group has a number of pension schemes, both of a defined benefit and defined contribution nature.
Full details are provided in note 35 including the departure from IAS 19 required for the Groups RPS obligations as outlined in the Statement of Compliance.
The liability in respect of defined benefit schemes comprises the total for each scheme of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially, separately for each plan, but the obligation is updated annually by independent actuaries for financial reporting purposes, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised in staff pension costs within operating costs in the income statement.
Past service costs are included in operating costs where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The finance elements of the pension cost, comprising the expected return on assets of funded defined benefit schemes and the interest on pension scheme liabilities, are also included in operating costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of recognised income or expense in the period in which they arise.
Our TOCs participate in the RPS, a defined benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK Rail industry.
This is partitioned into sections and the Group is responsible for the funding of these sections whilst it operates the relevant franchise.
In contrast to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the employee.
A liability is recognised in line with other defined benefit schemes in the Group, although this is offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability represents the deficit that the Group expects to fund during the franchise term.
This represents a departure from IAS 19 so as to present fairly the Groups financial performance, position and cash flow in respect of its obligations for the RPS.
The charges in respect of defined contribution schemes are recognised when they are due.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Share-based payment In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 Share-based payment, has been applied only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
Non-market-based performance-related vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value: instead those non-market conditions are taken into account in calculating the current best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and at each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated based on that estimate.
Market-based performance conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value and at each balance sheet date before vesting.
The cumulative expense is calculated irrespective of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are met.
Share capital, share premium and dividends Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where either the Company or employee share trusts purchase the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any transaction costs, is deducted from total shareholders equity as own shares until they are cancelled or reissued.
Any consideration subsequently received on sale or reissue is included in shareholders equity.
Dividends are recorded as a liability in the period in which the liability to pay shareholders arises.
Foreign currencies The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling, the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year as a reasonable approximation to actual exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1 relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to provide a hedge against the Group net investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement.
54 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these accounts: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies 1 March 2006 IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 2006 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 2006 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 Upon adoption of IFRS 7 the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail although there will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
The Directors are currently reviewing the requirements of IFRIC 12 to determine whether there will be a material impact on the Groups accounts.
Apart from this the Directors do not anticipate the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application.
3 EXCHANGE RATES The most significant exchange rates to UK sterling for the Group are as follows: Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate 2006 2006 2005 2005 US dollar 1.96 1.85 1.72 1.82 Canadian dollar 2.28 2.09 2.00 2.20 Euro 1.48 1.47 1.45 1.47 Australian dollar 2.48 2.44 2.35 2.39 The 2005 average rate for euros reflects the average rate since the Alsa acquisition.
If the results for the year to 31 December 2005 had been retranslated at the average exchange rates for the year to 31 December 2006, North America would have achieved normalised operating profit of 35.0m on revenue of 241.7m, compared to normalised operating profit of 35.0m on revenue of 241.8m as reported, and Alsa would have remained the same with normalised operating profit of 2.6m on revenue of 18.2m note 5.

8 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT The charge in respect of share-based payment transactions included in the Groups income statement for the year is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Expense arising from share and share option plans continuing operations 2.0 3.5 discontinued operations 0.1 2.0 3.6 During the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group had seven share-based payment arrangements, which are described in note 7.
Included in the charge for share-based payment transactions is nil 2005: 2.1m which relates to share options granted in 2005 under the TWM SIP which vested immediately.
The fair value of share options granted in 2005 under the TWM SIP was measured using the market price at the grant date.
For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average exercise prices.
The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise Number of price Number of price share options p share options p Options without a nil exercise price: At 1 January 4,807,708 620 7,594,301 587 Granted during the year 36,406 932 49,534 883 Lapsed during the year 378,604 833 979,569 658 Exercised during the year 3,079,512 544 1,856,558 471 1 Outstanding at 31 December 1,385,998 738 4,807,708 620 Exercisable at 31 December 492,299 813 1,632,374 786 Options with a nil exercise price: At 1 January 716,299 nil 11,002 nil Granted during the year 791,645 nil 711,271 nil Lapsed during the year 61,845 nil 5,974 nil Exercised during the year 21,295 nil nil Outstanding at 31 December 1,424,804 nil 716,299 nil Exercisable at 31 December Total outstanding at 31 December 2,810,802 5,524,007 Total exercisable at 31 December 492,299 1,632,374 1 Included within this balance are options over 412,896 2005: 2,360,125 shares for which no expense has been recognised in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 as the options were granted before 7 November 2002 and have not been subsequently modified.
60 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 8 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT CONTINUED The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had exercise prices that were between 398p and 1224p 2005: between 398p and 1224p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
Options were exercised regularly throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 911p 2005: 863p.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options without Share options with nil exercise price nil exercise price 2006 2005 2006 2005 Risk free interest rate 4.4%4.7% 4.3%4.8% Expected volatility 27.0%27.5% 27.6%28.0% 19% 25.0%27.0% Peer group volatility 29.7%31.2% 34.0% Expected option life in years 6 years 6 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.6%3.8% 3.4% 3.4%3.5% 3.3%3.7% Weighted average share price 937p940p 871p888p 931p1033p 838p906p Weighted average exercise price 920p940p 875p888p 0p 0p Weighted average fair value of options granted 181p188p 175p183p 369p934p 561p821p Experience to date has shown that approximately 15% 2005: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to redundancies.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.

e Unrecognised tax losses There is no recognition of the deferred tax asset in relation to the excess overseas tax losses on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence to determine that they are recoverable.

In addition, there are capital losses of 26.4m 2005: 30.2m which have not been recognised, recoverability of which is dependent on capital gains arising.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Indefinite life intangible assets including goodwill have been allocated to individual cash generating units for annual impairment testing on the basis of the Groups business operations.
The carrying value of indefinite life intangible assets by cash generating unit is as follows: 2006 2005 Contractual 2006 2006 Contractual 2005 2005 relationships Goodwill Total relationships Goodwill Total m m m m m m UK Bus 13.2 13.2 13.2 13.2 UK Trains 19.2 19.2 UK Coach 5.6 5.6 5.6 5.6 North American Bus 18.0 200.3 218.3 16.9 218.9 235.8 European Coach & Bus Alsa 290.8 290.8 298.2 298.2 18.0 509.9 527.9 16.9 555.1 572.0 The project to allocate the consideration paid to acquire Alsa to the fair value of assets acquired was completed during the year see note 19.
The amortisation charge in 2005 on the Alsa intangible assets acquired was immaterial.
The useful economic lives of contractual relationships in North America are deemed to be indefinite where historical experience has shown that these contracts are consistently renewed.
The customer contract and rail franchise intangible assets are amortised over the finite duration of the contract or franchise as appropriate.
All amortisation charges in the year have been charged to operating costs.
The recoverable amount of indefinite life intangible assets has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three year period.
Growth has then been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts.
66 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The assumptions used for the cash generating units, excluding UK Trains, are as follows: Growth rate used to extrapolate Discount rate applied to cash flows beyond three year cash flow projections period of management plan 2006 2005 2006 2005 UK Bus 10.7% 10.7% 2.0% 5.0% North America Bus 11.712.1% 10.812.1% 2.0% 2.0% UK Coach 10.7% 10.7% 2.0% 2.0% European Coach and Bus Alsa 10.7% 10.7% 2.0% 2.0% The discount rates represent the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital appropriate for the cash flow generated.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the assumptions over gross margin, discount rates, price inflation and growth rate.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
Due to the nature of the fixed term franchise agreements, the Group believes the goodwill that arises in UK Trains on the acquisition of Prism Rail PLC has a finite life.
This goodwill is subject to an annual impairment charge to reflect the finite nature of the cash flows related to this goodwill.
The net book value of this goodwill is nil 2005: 19.2m.
With respect to the recoverable amount of the UK Trains goodwill, the discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.7% 2005: 10.7% and the growth rate applied to the cash flow projections is 7.8% 2005: 13.4%.
Cash flows are sourced from management plans through to the end of the franchise.
The impairment charge in 2006 of 1.0m relates to the goodwill arising on the remaining share capital acquired of Altram LRT Limited due to ongoing operating losses.
The impairment charge in 2005 of 60.0m relates to our North American Public Transit operations that were sold on 1 September 2005 see note 11.

The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify maximum net debt to EBITDA and minimum EBITDA to interest ratios.
30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES Financial risk factors and management The Groups multi-national operations and significant debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most material of which are the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes in fuel prices.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of these risks on the financial performance of the Group by using financial instruments including borrowings, forward exchange contracts, fuel price and interest rate swaps.
The Board of Directors have delegated to a sub-committee, the Treasury committee, the responsibility for implementing the risk management policies laid down by the Board.
The policies are implemented by the central treasury department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The treasury department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk including the use of financial instruments.
The Group does not hold any financial instruments that would be classified as held for trading under IAS 39.
80 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED Foreign currency The Group has major operations in the US, Canada, Spain and residual assets in Australia and as a result is exposed to foreign exchange risks on translation of net assets and on earnings denominated in foreign currency.
The Group finances overseas investments mainly through the use of foreign currency borrowings to hedge the net asset investment.
The Group has also entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of its overseas subsidiaries.
These have the effect of increasing foreign currency denominated debt and reducing sterling debt.
The forward exchange contract terms run for periods up to one year.
The Group has a policy of hedging between 50% and 100% foreign currency denominated net assets.
At 31 December 2006 78% of the Groups exposure to US dollar assets were hedged, 92% of the exposure to Canadian dollar assets, 89% of the exposure to Australian dollar assets and 94% of the exposure to euro assets.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures, and with the exception of fuel purchases the Group believes these exposures are immaterial.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
It is the Groups policy to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide certainty as to the level of our interest expense in the short-term and to reduce the year on year impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term.
Interest on the Groups floating interest rate debt is based on LIBOR or EURIBOR and, to achieve the above objectives, the Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps that have the effect of converting floating debt to fixed debt.
The net effect of these transactions was that as at 31 December 2006 the Group was hedged against interest rate movements on 345.6m of gross debt for an average of 2.8 years.
Based on the year end debt, each 1% increase in interest rates would cost the Group approximately 0.9m.
Commodity prices The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
It is our policy to hedge this exposure in order to provide certainty as to the level of costs in the short-term and to reduce the year on year impact of price fluctuations over the medium term.
This is achieved by entering into fuel swaps and purchase contracts which are expected to be highly effective.
As at 31 December 2006 the Group had hedged approximately 97% of its 2007 expected usage, 63% of its 2008 expected usage and 35% of its 2009 expected usage.
Credit risk The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of each of its financial assets.
This risk is mitigated by a number of factors.
The majority of the Groups receivables are public or quasi-public bodies, both national DfT Rail and Network Rail in the UK and local school boards in North America, municipal authorities in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, Transport for London and Centro in the UK.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Treasury Committee and such approval is limited to financial institutions with an A rating or better.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the Treasury Committee.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds to meet current and forecast financial requirements as cost effectively as possible.
As at 31 December 2006 the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 903.1m of which 247.8m were undrawn.
The Groups primary loan facilities expire in June 2011 and the lease facilities at various times in line with their terms.
31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair values The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, fuel price and interest rate swaps has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar financial instruments.
The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is equal to the carrying value.
Other receivables and other payables are to be settled in cash in the currency they are held in.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk.

These instruments are summarised below: a A cash flow hedge with a total principal of US$100m that was entered into in September 2000 fixed at 6.8545% until September 2010. b A cash flow hedge with a principal of a200m that was entered into in December 2005 fixed at 2.84% until December 2007. c A cash flow hedge with a principal of a150m that was entered into in December 2006 fixed at 3.77% until December 2008 d An interest rate swap of US$100m that was entered into in September 2000 fixed at 6.9% and a separate US$100m interest rate swap that has the effect of fixing the accrued loss on the first swap.
These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, the net effect on the income statement is immaterial.
The conditions of all swaps remaining in place at 31 December 2006 coincide with the material conditions of the underlying loans.
The benchmark rate for floating rate financial liabilities is the relevant interbank borrowing rate.
During the year 2.4m has been transferred from the hedging reserve to the income statement in respect of interest rate swaps.
82 NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Hedging activities continued Hedge of net investments in foreign entities Included in bank loans are borrowings of US$190m 96.9m 2005: US$280m 162.7m, CAN$96m 41.1m 2005: CAN$70m 35.0m and a475m 320.0m 2005: a545m 374.9m which have been designated as a hedge of net investments in the foreign currency denominated net assets of the Group and are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
In addition the Group has synthetic debt in the form of foreign currency forward contracts in place split between US$185.0m 94.4m 2005: US$nil, CAN$150.0m 65.7m 2005: CAN$156.7m 78.3m, AUD$72.0m 29.0m 2005: AUD$80m 34.1m and a200.5m 135.1m 2005: a160m 110.1m to complete the post-tax hedge of the net investment in foreign entities.
The portion of the gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contracts that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and, to this extent, offsets any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
Fuel price hedges The Group has a number of fuel price swaps in place to hedge the different types of fuel used in each division.
Ultra low sulphur diesel and gasoil as used in the UK Bus, UK Coach, UK Trains and European Coach & Bus Alsa divisions are hedged by swaps in the same type of fuel.
Diesel used in the North American division is hedged by heating oil swaps which have been determined to be effective hedges of the fuel used with a strong correlation in price movements between the two products.
During the year 0.8m 2005: 12.9m has been transferred from the hedging reserve, of which 6.7m 2005: 4.9m was recognised in the hedging reserve at 1 January 2006 and the remainder was generated during the year due to the movement in market fuel prices.

For the RPS, mortality assumptions are based on the recent experience of the Scheme with an allowance for future improvements in mortality.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is determined based on the market returns prevailing on that date.
b Accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme The majority of employees of the UK Train companies are members of the appropriate section of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee.
To date, the Group has experienced five changes of UK Train franchise ownership where the current owner has funded the scheme during the franchise term and the pension deficit at franchise exit has transferred to the new owner, without cash settlement.
However, although the Groups past experience has proven otherwise, our legal advisers have opined that in certain situations, the liability for the deficit on the relevant sections of the RPS could theoretically crystallise for funding by an individual TOC at the end of the franchise.
By entering into the franchise contract, the TOC becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the rules of the RPS must fund its share of the pension liability in accordance with the schedule of contributions agreed with the Scheme trustees and actuaries and for which there is no funding cap set out in the franchise contract.
We understand that franchise contracts entered into in the future will clarify that RPS pension deficits and surpluses will not be the responsibility of the outgoing franchisee following exit.
To comply with IAS 19, the Group is required to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation that arises under the terms of each franchise agreement.
In determining the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the Groups accounts present fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows, management has consulted with TOC industry peers and has concluded that the Groups constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
This accounting policy, which in all other respects is consistent with that set out in this note for the Groups other defined benefit schemes, means that the Groups accounts reflect that element of the deficits anticipated to be settled by the Group during the franchise term and will prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new owner at franchise exit.
In calculating the Groups constructive obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out above.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
The franchise adjustment decreased from 71.0m at 31 December 2005 to 44.4m at 31 December 2006.
The decrease is caused by interest on the franchise adjustment of 2.5m offset by net actuarial movements in scheme liabilities of 6.7m and by 22.4m relating to the franchise exits.
In the prior year, the franchise adjustment increased by 3.4m from 67.6m at 1 January 2005 to 71.0m at 31 December 2005.
The increase was caused by interest on the franchise adjustment of 3.6m offset by net actuarial movements in scheme liabilities of 0.2m.
