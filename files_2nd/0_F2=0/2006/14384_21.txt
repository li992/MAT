This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
Normal restructuring costs are charged against profits.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure: exceptional items including impairments note 4 : amortisation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amortisation charge is a non-cash item, and the directors believe that it should be added back to give a clearer picture of underlying performance: and other financing gains and losses these represent the results of derivatives and other financial instruments which do not fall to be hedge accounted under IAS 39 and do not form part of the Groups financing strategy.
These items are included either within operating profit or profit before taxation depending on the nature of the transaction.
The application of IFRS accounting principles makes this item potentially volatile, and it is therefore excluded to give a clearer picture of the underlying performance.
4 Exceptional operating items Items which are material either because of their size or their nature, and which are non-recurring, are presented within their relevant consolidated income statement category, but highlighted separately within the line exceptional operating items.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better picture of the Companys underlying performance.
Items which may be included within the exceptional category include: profits losses on disposal of businesses: spend on the integration of significant acquisitions: and significant goodwill or other asset impairments.
An analysis of the items presented as exceptional in these financial statements is given below: Period ended Year ended 5 August 2006 31 July 2005 m m Integration of acquisitions 18.7 10.4 Patent dispute settlement 14.9 Class action settlement 12.2 Profit on disposal of businesses note 29 16.4 8.7 Impairment of goodwill 11.4 14.5 28.0 Period ended 5 August 2006 Restructuring costs in connection with the integration of Medex amounting to 18.7m 2005: 10.4m have been incurred in the period.
Along with three other companies, Titeflex Corporation, a US subsidiary, has settled an industry-wide class action with respect to its corrugated stainless steel tubing product in the US.
The settlement is a compromise of disputed claims and does not imply any admission of liability.
The company stands by the safety of this product, and has entered into this agreement solely to avoid the future expense, disruption and burden of protracted litigation.
The exceptional charge of 12.2m covers all legal fees and administrative costs, and an estimate for a contribution to certain homeowners towards remedial costs connected with the tubing.
Profit on disposal of businesses includes 11.2m relating to the release of provisions and accruals made in respect of prior-year disposals, the warranties and attendant issues for which they were created having been satisfactorily resolved.
Year ended 31 July 2005 14.9m was charged to exceptional operating items in respect of a patent dispute relating to the Cozmonitor insulin pump.
Profit on disposal of businesses of 8.7m included a total of 12.1m arising from settlement and curtailment gains in respect of pension and other retirement benefits.
In addition, two small product lines with a net asset value of 2.6m were sold during 2005 for net cash proceeds of 0.5m.
This gave rise to a loss of 3.4m after provisions in the year ended 31 July 2005.
11.4m was charged to exceptional operating items in relation to the impairment of goodwill in respect of an Aerospace business acquired in 2000.

No additional tax liabilities have been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the timing of other temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the future.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 205m 2005: 186m relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
The Group's capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arise.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below.

The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and in the United States and are of the defined benefit type, with assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, principally post-retirement healthcare, in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2006.
The most recent valuations of the 6 principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2005.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 5 August 2006.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 5 August 2006.
Contributions to these schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The Group provides a defined contribution 401K plan for its US employees.
The disclosures relate to all defined benefit retirement plans in the United Kingdom and the United States.
There are also abbreviated disclosures for other countries.
Defined benefit plans in other territories which are not covered under this disclosure on grounds of immateriality, most of which are unfunded, have net pension liabilities of 7.5m 2005: 7.1m.
These are reported within other creditors.
UK and USA The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2006 2005 UK US UK US Rate of increase in salaries 3.8% 3.8% 3.4% 3.75% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.7% n a 2.5% n a Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.8% n a 2.4% n a Discount rate 5.3% 6.2% 5.0% 5.50% Inflation rate 2.8% 2.8% 2.4% 2.75% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% 9% p. a. reducing 1% p. a. to 5% in 2011 9% p. a. reducing 1% p. a. to 5% in 2010 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used in the UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme and the assumptions also allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member who retires in 2013 at age 65 will live on average for a further 21 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years after retirement if they are female.
The mortality table used for the US retirement plans is based on the most recent mortality study produced for retired pensioners in the US the RP 2000 table.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue versus white collar.
If a participant retires in 2013 at age 65, it is expected that they will live 19 years if male, and 21 years if female.
The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 5 August 2006 were: 2006 2005 UK schemes US schemes UK schemes US schemes Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m Equities 8.0% 1,513.2 8.8% 212.3 8.0% 1,324.0 8.8% 215.2 Government bonds 4.9% 720.2 5.1% 76.2 4.7% 673.2 4.5% 71.7 Corporate bonds 5.3% 248.1 6.2% 42.1 5.0% 294.5 5.5% 27.3 Property 7.0% 162.1 n a n a 7.0% 131.9 n a n a Other 4.8% 126.8 5.0% 2.2 4.8% 123.3 3.0% 29.7 Total market value 2,770.4 332.8 2,546.9 343.9 Present value of funded pension scheme liabilities 2,630.1 394.3 2,529.1 467.2 Surplus deficit 140.3 61.5 17.8 123.3 Unfunded pension plans 31.9 4.3 31.8 4.7 Post-retirement healthcare 17.0 64.5 17.9 76.7 Net pension asset liability 91.4 130.3 31.9 204.7 The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

The value in use calculation determined the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash-flows of the cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash-flows.
This charge was reflected in operating profit for the Aerospace division.
71 Smiths Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the accounts continued 11 Intangible assets continued Significant cash generating units Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
Value in use calculations are utilised to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held within each cash generating unit CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash-flows of the CGU in which the goodwill is contained, applying a discount rate of the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%.
These forecast cash-flows are based on approved budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
Goodwill held in the Smiths Medical Critical Care and Imaging Systems CGUs, comprising 302.5m and 215.6m at net book value respectively, are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying value of goodwill at 5 August 2006.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash-flow projections for the Smiths Medical Critical Care and Heimann CGUs: growth rates of 2% have been used for the Smiths Medical Critical Care and Imaging Systems CGUs to extrapolate beyond the most recent forecasts representing a view of the long-term average growth rates for the industries in which the businesses operate.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning precesses do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for similar projects and do not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment planning: and in addition to discount rates and long-term growth rates, the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the Smiths Medical Critical Care and Imaging Systems CGUs include future sales prices and volumes with reference to specific customer relationships and product lines, operating margins, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise planned productivity improvements.
The growth rates and margins used in the discounted cash-flow forecasts are based on past performance and historical growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets as a guide.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the Smiths Medical Critical Care and Imaging Systems CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amount.

They carry a fixed cumulative preference dividend at the rate of 15% per annum.
One-third of the dividend is payable on 25 July each year, subject to certain financial conditions having been met.
To date, these conditions have not been met, and no dividends have been paid.
The preference shares are redeemable, together with unpaid dividends, following full repayment of the outstanding liabilities of TI Automotive Limited under its bank facilities.
No dividend accrual has been recognised as at 5 August 2006.
Recognising continued deterioration in the automotive market, particularly in the US, an impairment review of the preference share investment in TI Automotive has been undertaken, as required by IAS 39.
The preference shares have not yet borne any dividends and it is considered unlikely that dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.
Similarly there is no current prospect of the preference share interest being redeemed.
The directors have also considered the possibility that cash flows could accrue from the investment in TI Automotive in the event that the enterprise is sold: such a sale is not currently considered sufficiently probable to take into account any cash flows which could accrue in such an event.
As a result, the directors have decided to write down the carrying value of the investment in the TI Automotive preference shares from 325m to nil value in these accounts.
The Company also holds 19.99% of the issued ordinary share capital of TI Automotive Limited.
The shares confer 19.99% of the voting rights attaching to ordinary shares, and additionally confer the right to appoint the Chairman and to benefit from compulsory transfer provisions which oblige the other shareholders to sell their shares to a purchaser making an offer accepted by Smiths subject to certain conditions.
The ordinary shares are recorded at nil value in these accounts.

The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using various instruments and techniques, including foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board.
The Central Treasury function receives regular reports from all the businesses to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The treasury policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risks, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
a Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
Under the Groups foreign exchange policy, such transactional exposures are hedged once they are certain or highly probable, mainly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations, particularly in the Americas, but to a lesser extent Europe and the rest of the world.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group therefore seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing either directly in either the local domestic markets or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward foreign exchange contracts.
Based on the composition of net debt at 5 August 2006, a 10% appreciation in sterling against major currencies would result in a reduction in the Groups net debt of approximately 48m.
A 10% weakening in sterling against major currencies would result in an increase in the Groups net debt of approximately 48m.
b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a three-year horizon.
This is achieved partly through the fixed rate character of the underlying debt instrument, and partly through the use of interest rate swaps.
Interest rate derivative instruments are accounted for as fair value or cash-flow hedges of the relevant assets or liabilities.
At 5 August 2006 38% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates, post swaps.
Based on the composition of net debt and financing arrangements at 5 August 2006, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates would have a 6m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
c Credit risk Financial The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their expectations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups Board approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long-term credit rating, normally at least AAor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 11m, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign exchange contracts at 5 August 2006 to a single bank was 12m.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets totals 772m at 5 August 2006.
Operational As tier one suppliers to aerospace manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time, the largest being Boeing and the Department of Defense.
There are many advantages in these relationships and the credit risk is managed at a number of levels.
Debtor days and overdue accounts are reported to divisional management who co-ordinate any action required and overall divisional performance is regularly reviewed by management.
At 5 August 2006, the Aerospace business had trade receivables of 229m and 65m due from these two customers representing 10% of total trade receivables for the Group.
77 Smiths Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the accounts continued 20 Financial instruments continued d Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
During the period, the Group extended its principal credit facility 660m revolving credit facility to 2011 and entered into new facilities of 190m which, when taken together, were undrawn by 395m at 5 August 2006.
As at 5 August 2006 18m was on deposit with various banks and in money market funds of which 16m was on deposit in the UK.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The table below presents the carrying amounts under IFRS and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 5 August 2006.
The carrying amounts at 31 July 2005 are presented on the UK GAAP basis applicable at that date rather than in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39 as described later in note 20.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount: short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments: long-term loans approximates to the carrying amount for floating rate debt [and quoted market prices of equivalent instruments for fixed rate debt]: forward exchange contracts based on market valuations at the balance sheet date: currency swaps based on market valuations at the balance sheet date: interest rate instruments based on the net present value of discounted cash-flows: embedded derivatives based on the net present values of discounted cash-flows: preference shares see note 14 regarding impairment : receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount for both long term and short term: provisions approximates to the carrying amount: and lease obligations approximates to the carrying value.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities Borrowings are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost, adjusted for fair value movements in respect of related fair value hedges.

Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Reorganisation Significant parts of the Companys operations have been undergoing a phased restructuring programme.
Full provision is made for reorganisation approved and committed by the end of each financial year.
This years residual balance relates mainly to Aerospace and Medical, and is expected to be utilised during the next financial year.
Property As stated in the accounting policies on pages 54 to 57, where a property is vacant, or sub-let under terms such that rental income is insufficient to meet all outgoings, the Company provides for the expected future shortfall up to termination of the lease.
Provision is also made for the cost of reinstatement work on leased properties where there is an obligation under the lease, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Where evidence of contamination is found on property in the Companys occupation, provision is made for estimated remedial costs pending action on the affected site.
Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next five years.
Litigation The Company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its patents and other business intellectual property rights against infringement, and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provision is made for the expected fees and associated costs, based on professional advice as to the likely duration of each case.
Provisions totalling 1.1m were released relating to litigation settled at less than the expected cost.
None of the above provisions are discounted.

As previously reported, John Crane, Inc John Crane, a subsidiary of the Company, is one of many co-defendants in numerous law suits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The John Crane products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of John Crane, the products were safe.
John Crane ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
John Crane has resisted every case in which it has been named and will continue its robust defence of all asbestos-related claims based upon this safe product defence.
As a result of its defence policy, John Crane has been dismissed before trial from cases involving approximately 128,000 claims over the last 27 years.
John Crane is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 162,000 claims.
Despite these large numbers of claims, John Crane has had final judgements against it, after appeals, in only 55 cases, amounting to awards of some US$52.6m over the 27 year period.
To date these awards, the related interest and all material costs of defending these claims have been met directly by insurers.
Since the year end John Crane has secured the commutation of certain insurance policies, resulting in anticipated proceeds of approximately US$54m.
While substantial insurance will remain in place, it is likely that John Crane will in future meet defence costs directly, seeking appropriate contribution from insurers thereafter.
No provision relating to this litigation has been made in these accounts other than as disclosed in note 21.
At 5 August 2006, contingent liabilities, comprising bonds and guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounted to 91m 2005: 86m.
At 5 August 2006 certain unfunded pension liabilities, recognised on the balance sheet, were secured by means of a fixed and floating charge over land and buildings 25m and cash deposits 10.7m.
In the period the Parent Company arranged a 100m letter of credit facility to support the Groups pension plans.
The Parent Company has guaranteed the US$250m 5.45% Senior Notes 2013 privately placed by a subsidiary and the 660m revolving credit facility used by a subsidiary.

All issued shares are fully paid.
The adjustment results in a decrease in creditors of 35.4m and an increase in shareholders equity of 35.4m.
2 During the period since 21 November 2005, the Company has made a minor amendment to its previously published IFRS information as a result of emerging interpretations of standards.
3 As allowed by IFRS 3, the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in prior year acquisitions have been finalised.
These adjustments result in a decrease in goodwill of 0.4m, an increase in other assets of 2.1m, and an increase in shareholders equity of 1.7m.
4 The basis for valuing non-closely related embedded derivatives was revised in the year to better represent the contractual cash flows in the relevant contracts.

In addition, the Company also acquired the minority interests in subsidiary companies operating in Canada and China.
The values set out below are provisional pending finalisation of the fair values attributable, and will be finalised in the period ending 31 July 2007.
All acquisitions are wholly owned.
Goodwill and other net assets in respect of prior year acquisitions, as previously reported, have been adjusted as a result of finalising their attributable fair values.
Accordingly goodwill has decreased by 0.4m and other assets have increased by 2.1m.

Goodwill represents the value of synergies arising from the acquisitions and the acquirees assembled workforces.
The adjustments to current assets and liabilities relate to valuation adjustments and are provisional, based on managements best estimates.
From the date of acquisition to 5 August 2006, the acquisitions contributed 21.3m to revenue, 2.2m to headline profit before taxation and 0.9m to profit before taxation.
If Smiths had acquired the assets at the beginning of the financial period, the acquisitions would have contributed 27.5m to revenue and 1.1m to profit.
29 Disposals The most significant disposal transaction during the period was the sale of the Companys interest in Heimann Biometric Systems GmbH to Cross Match Technologies, Inc. in exchange for 43% of the issued share capital in that company, which is regarded as an associate and its results are therefore accounted for on an equity basis see note 13.

The nature of each scheme and plan, including general conditions, is set out below: Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme is an HM Revenue & Customs-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme which is open to all UK employees, including directors, with 12 months service or more.
Participants enter into a contract to save a fixed amount per month of up to 250 in aggregate for three or five years and are granted an option over shares at a fixed option price, set at a 20% discount to market price at the date of invitation to participate.
In the case of five-year savings contracts, participants can elect to delay maturity of the contract until its seventh anniversary.
The number of shares comprising the option is determined by the monthly amount saved and the bonus paid on maturity of the savings contract.
Options granted under the SAYE scheme are not subject to any performance conditions.
Smiths Industries 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme 84 ESOS No options have been granted under this scheme since 1994.
This scheme ceased to exist on 8 April 2005 following the exercise of the last remaining option.
Smiths Industries 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 95 ESOS The 95 ESOS replaced the 84 ESOS in 1995.
Options granted under the 95 ESOS can only be exercised after three years if a performance requirement, determined by the Remuneration Committee, has been met.
Options granted under the 95 ESOS up to 2001 are subject to performance testing based on total shareholder return of the Company versus the total return of the General Industrials Sector of the FTSE All Shares Index.
Options granted from 2002 are subject to a performance test based on growth in the Companys earnings per share.
If the performance requirement is not satisfied at the end of the third year, the performance period may be extended for up to two further years so that performance is tested over a four-year period at the end of the fourth year and a five-year period at the end of the fifth year.
The performance requirement is that the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share over the three four five financial years beginning immediately prior to the option grant must exceed the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period by 3% per annum for options up to one times base salary and by 4% per annum for the excess up to two times base salary.
Executive directors received their final grants of options under the 95 ESOS in October 2003.
From 2004 senior executives, including directors, have received awards under the PSP see below.
Grants under the 95 ESOS continue to be made to other executives.
Smiths Industries Senior Executive Deferred Share Scheme DSS Under the DSS executive directors and senior employees were able to use their after tax bonus to purchase the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the participant is still in office, he can exercise an option granted to him over matching shares, in respect of any shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares awarded was determined by the Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus was earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The last grant under the DSS was made on 7 December 2004, in respect of bonus earned in the year to 31 July 2004, and matched shares purchased in the market by the grantee on that day.
The DSS has been replaced by the CIP see below.
Smiths Group Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was introduced in 2004 and replaced the 95 ESOS for executive directors and senior executives.
Conditional awards of up to 1.5 times salary and exceptionally three times salary are granted annually.
The awards will be released following the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent the PSPs performance tests have been met.
One-third of the award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three year performance period.
25% of the award will vest if the companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straight-line pro-rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target measured before exceptional items.
Full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% per annum.
25% vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between 5% and 12%.
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP In October 2005 the CIP replaced the DSS.
Under the CIP the executive directors and senior executives are able, if invited, to use their after tax bonus or 25% of their basic salary after tax, whichever is the greater, to invest in the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, he will be awarded matching shares in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur and the matching shares will be released at the end of the three year period if the Companys Return on Capital Employed RoCE over the Performance Period exceeds the Companys weighted average cost of capital over the Performance Period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
TI Group 1994 Savings Related Share Options Scheme TI SAYE The last invitation to participate in the TI SAYE Scheme, an HM Revenue & Customs-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme, was issued in 2000.
The extant options are held by employees of the former TI Group who elected to receive seven-year options in 1999 and 2000.
No performance conditions attach to this scheme.
TI Group 1990 Executive Share Option Scheme TI 90 ESOS No options have been granted under this scheme since 1999 when it was replaced by the TI 99 ESOS see below.
Executives who held options at the time of the merger of TI Group into Smiths Group were able to exercise their options at the time or to roll them over into continuing options over an equivalent number of Smiths Group shares.
The performance conditions attaching to this scheme were waived as a result of the change of control of TI Group.
TI Group 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme TI 99 ESOS No options have been granted under this scheme since 2000 when TI Group was merged into Smiths Group.
Executives who held options at time of the merger were able to exercise their options at the time or to roll them over into continuing options over an equivalent number of Smiths Group shares.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.
