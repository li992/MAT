Daily Mail and General Trust plc 66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT Continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and compare the net present value of these cash flows using a suitable discount rate to determine if any impairment has occurred.
A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets at the balance sheet date was 1,124.9 million after an impairment loss of 59.1 million recognised during the year.
Operating profit The Group discloses as operating profit, profit before investment revenue, other gains and losses and finance costs.
Adjusted profits and exceptional items The Group presents adjusted earnings by making adjustments for costs and revenues which management believe to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence and by adding back amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
Share-based payments The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives: these are set out in note 38.
Management regularly perform a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest, this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Taxation Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure which makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes.
Such issues can take several years to resolve.
The Group however takes a prudent view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Groups results and future cash flows.

Operating profit before exceptional operating costs and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets within the business to business information and careers division comprised 68.0 million from business to business information and 4.1 million from Study Group offset by unallocated central costs of 4.1 million.
Included within unallocated central costs is a credit of 1.8 million which adjusts the pensions charge recorded in each operating segment from a cash rate to actuarial accrual rate in accordance with IAS 19.
The Groups exceptional operating costs comprised regional newspapers and related activities restructuring and strategic review costs totalling 31.9 million, together with reorganisation costs of 5.8 million within national newspapers and related activities, 0.6 million in business to business information and careers and 2.8 million within exhibitions and related activities.
If all acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, contribution to Group revenues for the year would have been 73.0 million and contribution to Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been 10.3 million.
This information takes into account the amortisation of acquired intangible assets for a full year, together with related income tax effects but excludes any pre-acquisition finance costs and should not be viewed as indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisitions had actually been completed on the first day of the financial year.
