Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs JKX Oil & Gas plc the ultimate parent of the group is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated in England.
The registered office is 6 Cavendish Square, London, W1G 0PD and the principal place of business is disclosed in the introduction to the annual report.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group are the exploration for, appraisal and development of oil and gas reserves.
The Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 20 March 2007 and the balance sheets were signed on the board's behalf by Lord Fraser and Mr B J Burrows.
The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the group are set out below.
Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards The financial information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the structure of the Group at 31 December 2006 as described in Note 1. a Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2006 but that have no impact on the financial statements.
"The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006 but have no impact on the Groups financial statements:"" IAS 19 Amendment, Employee benefits IAS 21 Amendment, Net investment in a foreign operation IAS 39 Amendment, Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions IAS 39 Amendment, The fair value option IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Amendment, Financial guarantee contracts IFRS 1 Amendment, Firsttime adoption of international financial reporting standards IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease IFRIC 5 Rights to interests arising from decommissioning restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds, and IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market Waste electrical and electronic equipment b Standards and Interpretation to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group."
The following new standards and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups financial statements from 2007.
The Group has not early adopted these new standards and interpretations in 2006: IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures effective 1 January 2007.
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies effective from 1 March 2006.
IFRIC 7 provides guidance on how to apply the requirements of IAS 29 in a reporting period in which an entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the economy of its functional currency, when the economy was not hyperinflationary in the prior period.
The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is not a currency of a hyperinflationary economy and therefore IFRIC 7 is not relevant to the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
IFRIC 8 requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued to establish whether or not they fall within the score of IFRS 2.
The Group will apply IFRIC 8 for the 2007 financial statements, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006.
IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative when the entity first becomes a party to the contract.
Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required under the contract, in which case reassessment is required.
IFRIC 9 is not expected to have any impact on the Group's financial statements.
Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards continued IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
IFRIC 10 prohibits the impairments losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investment in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date.
The Group will apply IFRIC 10 for the 2007 financial statements, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
Significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control.
Interests in joint venture agreements The Group is party to a number of joint venture contractual arrangements with other parties venturers which govern the operation of associated jointly controlled assets.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint control exists only when the strategic financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the venturers.
Where a group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements, the Groups share of jointly and directly controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other ventures are recognised and classified according to their nature.
Income from the sale or use of the Groups share of the output of jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses, are included in the consolidated financial statements in proportion to the group's interest.
Foreign currencies The presentation currency of the Group is the US Dollar based on the fact that the Group's primary transactions originate in US Dollar, these being amongst others oil sales and procurement of rigs and drilling services.
Financial statements of foreign currency denominated companies are translated into US Dollars using the monthly average exchange rates.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups nonUS Dollar functional currency companies are retranslated into US Dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are only recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which any such operation is disposed of.
The Company holds monetary balances with its subsidiaries which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and thus this is considered to be part of the Company's net investment in the relevant subsidiary.
An exchange difference arises on translation in the Company income statement which on consolidation is recognised in equity, only being recognised in the income statement on the disposal of the net investment.
The exchange rate used for the revaluation of the closing balance sheet at 31 December 2006 was 1 $1.957 2005: 1 $1.717.
Property, plant and equipment Property plant and equipment comprises the Group's tangible oil and gas assets together with computer equipment, motor vehicles and fixtures and fittings and are carried at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price and construction costs for qualifying assets and borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Oil and gas assets Exploration and development expenditure is accounted for under the successful efforts method.
The successful efforts method means that only costs which relate directly to the discovery and development of specific oil and gas reserves are capitalised.
Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised within intangible assets.
Capital expenditure on producing assets is accounted for in accordance with IAS16.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to explore are expensed immediately to the income statement.
Significant accounting policies continued All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration, evaluation and development are capitalised as intangible or property plant and equipment according to their nature.
Intangible assets comprise costs relating to the exploration and evaluation of properties which the directors consider to be unevaluated until reserves are appraised as commercial, at which time they are transferred to property plant and equipment following an impairment review and depreciated accordingly.
Where properties are appraised to have no commercial value, the associated costs are treated as an impairment loss in the period in which the determination is made.
Costs are amortised on a field by field unit of production method based on commercial proven and probable reserves, with the exception of compressors, which are depreciated on a straightline basis 10 years over their anticipated useful life.
The calculation of the 'unit of production' amortisation takes account of estimated future development costs and is based on current period end unescalated price levels.
Changes in reserves and cost estimates are recognised prospectively.
Other assets Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straightline method, for the following classes of assets: Motor vehicles 4 years Computer equipment 3 years Other equipment 5 to 10 years The estimated useful lives of property plant and equipment and their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for the relevant period.
Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
Individual assets are grouped together as a cashgenerating unit for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which their identifiable cash flows, that are largely independent of the cash flows of the other groups assets, can be determined.
In the case of exploration and evaluation assets this will normally be at a field level.
If any such indication of impairment exists the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Where the carrying amount of an individual asset or a cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset cashgenerating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In accessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset cash generating unit and are discounted to their present value that reflects the current market indicators.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cashgenerating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Decommissioning Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the time when the obligation to decommission arises.
Such provision represents the estimated discounted liability discount rate 10% for costs which are expected to be incurred in removing production facilities and site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field.
A corresponding item of property plant and equipment is also created at an amount equal to the provision.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates of the cash flow or the current estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the property plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and other costs associated in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Leasing Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
Cash equivalents are shortterm with an original maturity of less than 3 months, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable costs.
After initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are accounted for on an accrual basis and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible loan notes The Group elected to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005.
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt.
The difference between the net proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity capital reserves.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
The liability was derecognised on conversion of the convertible loan notes in May 2005.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Loans are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans are derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments The Group may use derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions.
Any such derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
There has been no hedging activity during the period 2005: nil.
Sharebased payment Share options The Group issues equitysettled sharebased payments to the directors and senior management.
Equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each subsequent balance sheet date the Group calculates the estimated cumulative charge for each award having regard to any change in the number of options that are expected to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period.
The change in this cumulative charge since the last balance sheet is expensed.
Once an option vests, no further adjustment is made to the aggregate amount expensed.
The fair value which is calculated using the binomial model takes into account two performance criteria, being the actual increase in the Company's share price and a comparison of the actual increase in the share price to the change in FTSE FI until end of June 2004, the FTSE SI until end of February 2006 and the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index subsequent to that.
The expected life of the options depends on the behaviour of the option holders, which is incorporated into the option model consistent with historic data.
The fair values calculated are inherently subjective and uncertain due to the assumptions made and the limitations of the model used.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value of 10p per share and share premium when the options are exercised.
The rules regarding the scheme are described in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 36 to 38 and in note 24 on share based payments.
Bonus Scheme The Group operates a bonus scheme for its Directors and employees.
The scheme has three performance conditions: 1. financial objectives: 2. increase in share price: and 3. key strategic objectives.
The bonus payments are made annually, normally in January of each year and the costs are accrued in the period to which they relate.
Pension costs The Group contributes to the individual pension scheme of the qualifying employees choice.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Significant accounting policies continued The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Any such reduction shall be reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there exists a legal and enforceable right to offset and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Revenue recognition Sales of oil and gas products are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer and it can be reliably measured.
Other services are recognised when the services have been performed.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, by reference to the net carrying amount at the effective interest rate applicable.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the income statement account in the period in which they are incurred.
Treasury shares JKX Oil & Gas plc treasury shares held by the Company and the Group are classified in shareholders' equity.
The consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of transaction costs, is included in equity attributable to the company's equity holders.
No gain or loss is recognised in the financial statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a Recoverability of intangible oil and gas costs Costs capitalised as intangible assets are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying value may exceed its recoverable value.
This assessment involves judgement as to i the likely commerciality of the asset, and ii future revenues and costs pertaining and the discount rate to be applied for the purposes of deriving a recoverable value.
b Decommissioning The Group has decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests.
The full extent to which the provision is required depends on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the costs and timing of any decommissioning works and the discount rate applied to such costs.
c Oil and gas assets Oil and gas assets held in property plant and equipment are mainly depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate calculated by reference to proven and probable reserves and incorporating the estimated future cost of developing and extracting those reserves.
Future development costs are estimated using assumptions as to the numbers of wells required to produce those reserves, the cost of the wells, future production facilities and operating costs: together with assumptions on the oil and gas realisations.
Segmental analysis Segmental Information The primary segmental reporting format is determined to be the geographical segment according to the location of the asset.
The directors consider the group to have a single class of business, being the exploration for, development and production of oil and gas reserves.
Accordingly no secondary segmental information is presented.
There are five geographic reporting segments.
The Ukraine and USA are involved with production and exploration: Georgia and the 'Rest of World' are involved in exploration and the UK is the home of the head office.
The 'Rest of the World' segment comprises operations in Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey.
Transfer prices between segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment results include transfers between segments.
Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.
Cost of sales 2006 2005 $000 $000 Operating costs 17,343 14,744 Depreciation, depletion and amortisation 14,303 9,659 Production based taxes 2,750 1,283 34,396 25,686 Reversal of impairment provision 15,228 19,168 25,686 The Group previously recognised an impairment charge in respect of certain producing assets in Ukraine.
The impairment reflected uncertainty regarding the political and regulatory environment in Ukraine together with the relatively low Ukrainian oil and gas prices.
In 2006, following a step change in Ukrainian gas prices and easing of political and regulatory uncertainty, it was determined that the factors giving rise to the impairment have reversed and the impairment has been reversed also.
The amount of the reversal is determined by reference to the recoverable amount of the associated assets.
Recoverable amount was calculated based on expected future cash flows of the cash generating unit discounted at a rate of 10%.
The cash generating unit is the Group's NovoNikolaevskoye complex in Ukraine.
Consideration was given to the amount of depreciation that would have been suffered in the period since the impairment charge was taken.
The carrying value has been reinstated at a value not higher than the carrying value had the impairment not been made.
The cost of inventories expensed in 2006 was $34.5m 2005: $22.7m.
Operating profit The operating profit derives solely from continuing operations and is stated after charging the following: 2006 2005 $000 $000 Depreciation other assets 1,278 671 Foreign exchange gain 3,873 1,001 Minimum operating lease payments land and buildings 616 523 plant and machinery 12 21 Depreciation, depletion and amortisation of the oil and gas assets is included within cost of sales note 5.

Profits made overseas will not be able to be offset by costs elsewhere in the group.
This could lead to a higher than expected tax rate for the group.
Dividends On 18 May 2006, a dividend of 0.6 pence per share 2005: 0.3 pence per share was paid to shareholders and on 6 November 2006, an interim dividend for 2006 of 1.0 pence per share 2005: 0.5 pence per share was also paid to shareholders.
Total dividend paid during the year was 1.6 pence per share 2005: 0.8 pence per share.
Total dividend paid during the year was $4.5 million 2005: $2.2 million.
In respect of the full year 2006, the directors propose that a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share 2005: 0.6 pence per share be paid to shareholders on 1 June 2007.
This dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The proposed dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 10 April 2007.
The total estimated dividend to be paid is $3.6 million 2005: $1.6 million.

Provisions Provision for site restoration 2006 2005 $000 $000 At 1 January 590 475 Revision to estimate 76 68 Revision to timing of abandonment 213 Effect on discount of revision to timing of abandonment 16 47 At 31 December 437 590 The provision for site restoration is split between USA at $8,000 2005: $8,000 which is included in the intangible assets see note 13 a and for Ukraine $429,000 2005: $582,000 in property, plant and equipment see note 13 b.
The change in estimate reflects the increase in the number of wells that are required to be decommissioned as a result of recent drilling programmes.
The provision includes the site clean up, the removal of property, plant and equipment and the abandonment of wells.
The four production licences held in Ukraine were extended in 2005 by 10 years and will now expire in 2024.
The timing of the decommissioning of existing and future wells has been revised to account for this 10 year extension and the decommissioning will take place over this increased period.
The extent and cost of the future decommissioning is by its nature difficult to estimate, based on the timing and extent of the work programme to be completed.

Hedges The Group did not hold any financial instruments designated as hedges at the balance sheet date 2005: Nil.
Deferred taxation A deferred tax liability of $6.4m 2005:$2.8m arises in respect of the activities of Poltava Petroleum Company, based in Ukraine.
Provided deferred taxation Assets Liabilities Net 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 Fixed asset differences 9,701 6,435 9,701 6,435 Working capital temporary differences 5,966 4,259 2,623 608 3,343 3,651 Net deferred tax asset liability recognised 6,358 2,784 Unprovided deferred taxation 2006 2005 $000 $000 Tax losses 7,302 4,245 Fixed asset differences 159 68 Other temporary differences 5,195 2,517 Net deferred tax asset not recognised 12,338 6,830 $928,900 2005: $752,000 of the tax losses will expire principally between 2021 and 2026 2005: 2021 and 2025.
There is no expiry date on the remaining losses.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
At 31 December 2006, a deferred tax liability of $1.6m 2005: $13m relating to investments in subsidiaries has not been recognised.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the unprovided deferred taxation items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise these deductible temporary differences.
Obligations under leases At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding future minimum commitments under noncancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: Land and buildings Other 2006 2005 2006 2005 $000 $000 $000 $000 Within one year 741 546 16 32 In the second to fifth years inclusive 1,371 1,022 4 18 After five years 1,200 508 3,312 2,076 20 50 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for its office premises and office equipment.

Sharebased payments Share options Share options are granted to executive directors and senior management based on performance criteria.
The scheme rules are described in the Directors Remuneration Report and repeated below.
All sharebased payments are equity settled.
At 31 December 2006, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable during the years 2007 to 2016, to acquire 3,629,531 2005: 6,246,531 shares of the Company at prices ranging from 0.1675 to 3.83 per share 2005: 0.1675 to 1.515.
The vesting period of the options is 3 years, with an exercise period of 7 years, making a 10 year maximum term.
Sharebased payments continued The following table illustrates the number and weighted average prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the year.
2006 2006 2005 2005 Number WAEP Number WAEP 1 Outstanding as at 1 January 6,246,531 46.45p8,131,531 29.91p Granted during the year 305,500 330.77p 585,000 151.50p 3 2 Exercised during the year 2,922,500 22.76p 1,530,328 16.85p Surrendered during the year 939,672 16.85p Outstanding at 31 December 3,629,531 89.47p6,246,531 46.45p Exercisable at 31 December 479,031 20.80p 1 Included within this balance are options of 2,471,531 2005: 4,941,531 shares that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted on or before 7 November 2002.
These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
2 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of the options is 16.85p.
3 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of the options is 22.76p.
For the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2006, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.71 years 2005: 1.27 years.
During the year share options were granted in accordance with The New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New Unapproved Share Option Scheme collectively the New Share Option Schemes that were introduced in 2001.
They reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their guidelines in March 2001 the 'ABI Guidelines'.
For the options to vest there has to be an increase in Share Price combined with a comparison to an external benchmark the Financial Times Stock Exchange Oil & Gas Producers Index 'FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index'.
As a result of an increase in share price in the first quarter of 2006 the Company moved up into the FTSE 250 Index 'FTSE 250' and the benchmark was therefore reviewed and the Remuneration Committee decided that the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index was the most appropriate.
The Rules of the New Share Option Schemes address eligibility, timing of grants and exercise of options etc, and require that the shareholders are to be consulted if any substantive amendments to the Rules are required.
The Remuneration Committee Committee has discretion as to the application of the Rules of the New Share Option Schemes, particularly in the level of awards and the setting of the level of Performance Conditions.
The Committee has prepared internal guidelines to enable it to administer the New Share Option Schemes.
In awarding share options the Committee take into account the ABI Guidelines in terms of individual and collective limits, the need for demanding Performance Conditions etc, and other factors such as the performance of the Company and the individual in the previous 12 months, the effect of the vesting of grants awarded in previous years e. g. dilution, cost to the Company and the overall remuneration level annual salary, bonus award and benefits of the individual relative to the market.
Grants are made by reference to the market value mid Market price of the Company's shares under option at the time of grant.
Executive Directors and employees are not required to pay for the grant of share options.
After three years the number of options that can be exercised is determined by two factors: 1 the actual increase in the Companys Share Price: and 2 a comparison of the actual increase in the Share Price to the change in the FTSE FI until the end of June 2004, FTSE SI until the end of February 2006 and the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index after that date.
The Share Price and FTSE Factors will be multiplied together and the resultant figure will be applied to the number of options granted to an individual to determine the number of options to be vested.
The structure has been designed to introduce a sliding scale as distinct from a specific individual benchmark.
It will require the Share Price to double and this increase to be in the top quartile of the growth in the FTSE FI SI Oil & Gas Producers Index for all of the awards granted to an individual to determine the number of options that vest.
To encourage the retention of key staff, the Committee has determined that an option holder will only be able to exercise up to 50% of vested options at any one time and up to 50% after a period of 12 months, unless determined otherwise by the Committee.

Sharebased payments continued The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 21.771p 2005: 49.815p.
The fair value of equitysettled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 December 2006 amd 31 December 2005.
The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.
2006 2005 Dividend yield % 0.30 0.40 Historical volatility % 49.40 38.12 Expected comparator group volatility % 15.50 4.58 Expected share price volatility % 49.40 38.12 Risk free interest rate % 4.73 4.75 Expected life of option years 3.50 3.50 Weighted average share price pence 89.47p 46.45p Bonus scheme The performance criteria of the Directors and senior employees bonus payments includes a component that relates directly to JKX's share performance over the vesting period and a component which relates to the performance of JKX share price in relation to the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index.
The full details of the bonus performance criteria are explained in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 35 and 36.
Capital commitments Under the programmes for the development and production of oil and gas reserves in Ukraine, the Group had committed $3.5m to future capital expenditure on drilling rigs at 31 December 2006 2005: $1.5m.
Related party transactions Compensation of key management personnel.
Key management are considered to comprise only the directors.
The remuneration of directors during the year was as follows: 2006 2005 $000 $000 Shortterm benefits 2,148 2,071 Postemployment benefits 164 154 1 Sharebased payments equitysettled 10,722 4,073 13,034 6,298 1 Sharebased payments relates to the gain on exercise of options during the year.
Disposal of Oklahoma assets In December 2003 JKX disposed of its Oklahoma assets for $8.8 million.
The consideration was to be paid in two equal tranches of which $4.4 million was paid in December 2003 and the balance was due December 2004.
In December 2004 JKX entered into a US Dollar loan agreement with Avalon Exploration Inc which bore interest at 10% and was to recover principal and interest over a 3 year period.
In February 2006 Avalon Exploration Inc paid down the loan, including principal and interest.
Ukrainian business environment Ukraine continues to display emerging market characteristics, and its legislation and business practices regarding banking operations, foreign currency transactions and taxation is constantly evolving as the new government attempts to manage the economy.
Risks inherent in conducting business in an emerging market economy include, but are not limited to, volatility in the financial markets and the general economy.
Uncertainties over the development of the tax and legal environment, as well as difficulties associated with the consistent application and interpretation of current laws and regulations, have continued.
As at 31 December 2006, oil and gas assets based in Ukraine represent approximately 85% of the Groups oil and gas assets.
The Groups operations and financial position may be affected by these uncertainties.
The Groups financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability, and classification of assets or the amounts or classifications of liabilitites that may result from these uncertainties.
