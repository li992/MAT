9 Goodwill and intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
Brands that are classied as indefinite have been in the market for many years, and the nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how, and software, are capitalised and amortised in operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected useful lives, none of which exceeds ten years.
The level of amortisation for nitelived intangible assets is not expected to change materially over the next five years.
