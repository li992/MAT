In preparing these financial statements, the following significant limitations and Significant circumstances were taken into account.
matters relating to Investigations into accounting irregularities the basis of On 20 July 2006 the Company announced that the Board had commissioned an investigation into preparation possible accounting irregularities.
The initial independent investigation was completed on 7 August and of the concluded that there were grounds for a more formal investigation.
The Board also recognise that the financial commencement of the more formal investigation may give rise to further investigations by the Company statements and other parties.
The conclusion of the initial investigation was that there is evidence of irregularities in respect of subsidiaries affecting the financial years 2003 4 and 2004 5.
The principal effects of this would appear to have been to recognise revenues earlier than they should have been and would not appear to have had any effect on the cash position of the Company.
It is not possible for the Board to conclude what implications, if any, may arise from the conclusion of the investigations into these matters and it is possible that certain adjustments or restatements to the financial statements as presented may arise which could be material to the reported results or statement of 71 financial position as presented.
Accounting policy for revenue and cost recognition and lack of associated accounting information On 8 June 2006 the Board announced that it had decided to change the Group's accounting policy for revenue recognition to one appropriate to the current commercial situation of the business as described in the Chairman's report and in note 2.
In considering the most appropriate policy to apply the Board considered a number of different polices and practices.
The criteria applied in determining the most appropriate policy included an assessment of which policy would best reflect the underlying business contracts, the cash flows and the application of the resources of the business with the objective of ensuring that information could be reported so as to help users to assess business performance and the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash outflows and cash inflows.
The Board consider such information is essential in assessing the ability of the business to generate net cash inflows and provide economic returns to investors.
The revenue recognition policy as historically implemented was that all contracts were unbundled into their constituent parts, and an internally determined proportion of the contract value attributed to implementation and support was recognised evenly over the implementation and support phases of the contract respectively.
The balance of the contractual value was attributed to licence revenue and recognised at the date of contract.
The historical implementation of this policy presumed that supply of product licences can be separated from implementation and support.
The complex construction of the commercial contracts of the business, the level of resources applied to implementation and support on an ongoing basis and the absence of a reliable third party market in implementation and support of the Company's product have made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between the supply of product licences and implementation and support.
As the current Board has concluded that the previous accounting policy has become inappropriate and did not achieve the criteria and objective set out above it has decided that licence revenues will typically be recognised over the period of implementation, which may range from a few months to a number of years from contract signature, and over the full contract term in the case of full service contracts that are not capable of being unbundled.
Changing the accounting policy requires previously reported revenues to be restated under the newly adopted accounting policy.
The nature of the contracts underlying the revenues of the business determines the way in which revenue should be recognised.
In the case of implementation projects the licence and implementation revenues are appropriately recognised over the implementation period.
In the case of bundled contracts the total revenues of the contract including licence are appropriately recognised over the total duration of the contract.
The judgement of the Board is that this is the most appropriate way for the Company to recognise revenues on projects.
Notes to the financial statements 01 In accordance with IAS 18, revenue of the business that is earned through the rendering of services Significant should be recognised on a stage of completion basis in line with the activity and costs associated with each of the projects.
matters relating to Steps have been taken such that for new contractual arrangements the directors believe that it will be the basis of possible to capture costs and activity on a contract by contract basis so that the costs and activity can be preparation used as a basis of allocating costs and revenues between accounting periods.
Under the previous of the accounting policy capturing individual contract costs to measure contract activity was not deemed financial necessary.
Given the historical costing records of the business do not identify activity by contract, the information is not available to enable management to measure revenue on a strict stage of completion basis and therefore the directors have concluded that, in the absence of more reliable data, the most appropriate and practicable basis in the circumstances to recognise revenue on existing contracts is to use time as the basis of recognition.
The licence and implementation revenue is therefore spread evenly over the estimated period of the implementation in the case of implementation unbundled contracts and over the total contract term in the case of bundled contracts.
The lack of historical records to support the strict allocation of costs and revenues has meant that it is not 72 possible to provide sufficient and appropriate evidence to the independent auditors to demonstrate that revenue is recognised in line with contract activity as required by the new policy.
The cost base of the iSOFT business units has historically been predominantly fixed in nature.
The judgement of the Board, given the historical costing records, is that it is currently most appropriate and prudent to treat the costs, of the business as period costs accounting for them in the period they arise.
The Board is of the view that the new accounting policy now reflects an appropriate presentation of revenues.
Further, the Board is of the opinion, given the lack of historical records and resulting limitations in information, that spreading revenue evenly over the estimated period of the implementation in the case of implementation contracts and over the total contract term in the case of bundled contracts and treating costs as period costs provides the best available recognition of revenues and presentation of results of the business.
Information concerning the status of delivery under the National Programme for IT Revenue in relation to the National Programme contracts was formerly recognised according to development work done.
The new policy is to recognise revenue based on the timing of software delivery.
The National Programme contracts are product delivery arrangements with a phased release of functionality enhancements over the duration of the contracts, as described more fully on page 76.
The licence revenue arising is recognised as the elements of the product are delivered.
Given the complexity of the contractual arrangements between Connecting for Health and the LSPs and between the LSPs and iSOFT and the difficulty in measuring and recording delivery of product the Board has been unable to obtain conclusive third party confirmation of the status of delivery.
On the basis of the limited third party evidence that is available and the detailed internal knowledge and records of the iSOFT operational team, the Board believes that in the circumstances it has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that revenue that it has recognised in the accounts is in accordance with the stated accounting policies.
However, conclusive third party confirmation of the status of delivery from the LSPs may have given rise to adjustments or restatements to the financial statements as presented which could be material to the reported results or statement of financial position as presented, including the impact on capitalisation of associated development costs.
Potential for claims from National Programme Local Service Providers As described in the Finance Review and in note 29, the Group has experienced a number of difficulties in the delivery of the National Programme for IT, some of which are outside the control of the Group.
Some of these difficulties have resulted in formal correspondence being exchanged between the Company and the LSPs, Accenture and CSC, alleging material contractual breach by the Company.
The Company has vigorously denied all of the alleged breaches.
To date none of this correspondence has resulted in notice to terminate being given or any formal claims being made by the LSPs.
Financial Statements 2006 Annual Report and Accounts Notes to the financial statements The Company has taken legal advice on these matters.
However, due to the complexity and nature of the 01 contracts, and differences in interpretation of functional requirements and their delivery and in the Significant absence of any formal claim, it is not possible to establish the likelihood nor the quantum of any potential matters liability and consequently no specific provision has been made in relation to this matter.
relating to the basis of Were any claims, including the potential for claims noted above, to be brought against the Company the preparation Board would continue to deny liability and would defend its position vigorously.
Should such claims be of the substantiated then they could give rise to adjustments to the financial statements as presented, which financial could be material to reported results, cash flows and statement of financial position.
statements Going concern cont...
The Board has prepared projected cash flow information for the period ending 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
The projections include certain key assumptions made by the directors: a Future sales and margins consistent with prior experience which also take into account the anticipated effect of the current circumstances facing the business.
b Significant restructuring of its UK and international operations to generate cost savings from the 73 reduction of resources, the simplification and re-engineering of the Group's core processes and systems and the streamlining and simplification of the Group's product offerings.
c Disposal of the Group's non-core activities by certain key dates.
d Renegotiation of certain key contractual arrangements.
e The satisfaction of the conditions contained in the banking agreement to enable the continuation of the banks facilities described in note 19. f The Group previously derecognised contract financing arrangements as the obligations were considered non-recourse.
These obligations have been recognised on the balance sheet as it is now considered appropriate to recognise these as a balance sheet liability.
The banking covenants were calculated excluding these derecognised obligations and as such were these obligations to be included in previous covenant calculations the Group would not have been in compliance with its financial covenants.
As part of the revised banking agreements, detailed in note 19, a waiver has been provided for any prior breach of covenants.
The Directors therefore consider that there is no impact on the availability of its banking facilities.
The nature of the Group's business is such that there can be considerable unpredictable variation and uncertainty regarding the timing and or occurrence of the matters referred to above, the timing and margin of sales, the quantum and timing of cash flows from new business activity and the achievement of contractual milestones.
In preparing these projections the directors recognise that there are material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.
Having taken into account the uncertainties inherent in the assumptions referred to in this note 1, the directors consider that the cash flow projections are compiled on a reasonable basis and that it is appropriate that the financial statements should be prepared on the going concern basis.
Future events may give rise to circumstances not foreseen by the stated assumptions such that the use of the going concern basis proves to be inappropriate.
Should the going concern basis be inappropriate, the Company may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
The financial statements do not contain any adjustments that would be required were a satisfactory outcome to the uncertainties, as detailed above, not be achieved.
Such adjustments would include writing down the carrying value of assets, including goodwill, to their recoverable amount and providing for any further liabilities that may arise.
Notes to the financial statements 02 General information General iSOFT Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 129.
The nature of the Group's operations and its information principal activities are set out on page 25 and in the Financial Review on pages 13 to 23. and significant accounting These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary policies economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in the note below.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Right to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds 74 IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments, when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Significant accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 31.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Going concern The Group's directors have prepared projected cash flow information for the period ending 12 months from the date of approval of these accounts.
The projections include certain key assumptions made by the directors as disclosed in note 1.
The Group is currently undergoing a significant restructuring of its UK and international operations, a process which is expected to generate cost savings through, inter alia, the removal of excess resources built up during the Group's development over recent years, the simplification and re-engineering of the Group's core processes and systems, the renegotiation of contractual commitments and the streamlining and simplification of the Group's market offerings.
The projected cash flow information assumes that the restructuring plan referred to above will be implemented successfully.
The nature of the Group's business is such that there can be considerable unpredictable variation in the timing and margin of sales, the quantum and timing of cash flows from new business activity and the achievement of contractual milestones.
However, on the basis of the projected cash flow information, which assumes the continued careful management of working capital, and provided that the disposal of the Group's non-core activities is completed in the timescale currently envisaged, the directors consider that the Group will continue to operate within the bank facilities currently agreed.
Having taken into account the uncertainties referred to above, the directors consider that the cash flow projections are compiled on a reasonable basis on the assumptions set out in note 1 and it is on that basis that the directors consider it appropriate to prepare the Group's accounts on the going concern basis.
The Financial Statements 2006 Annual Report and Accounts Notes to the financial statements accounts do not include any adjustments which may be necessary if the Group were unable to continue 02 to operate.
General information Basis of consolidation and significant The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities accounting controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 30 April each year.
Control is achieved where the policies Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to cont... obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the profit and loss account in the period of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority's proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority interest is allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during a financial year are included from, or up to, the effective date of acquisition or disposal.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 75 financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.
Intercompany transactions, balances, and income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable net book value of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Internally-generated intangible assets - research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group's software development is recognised only if Notes to the financial statements 02 all of the following conditions are met: General an asset is created that can be clearly identified: information and significant it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and accounting the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
policies cont... Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives commencing from the date of first income recognition.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Revenue The Group's revenues are derived from the sale of software product licences, the attendant installation, maintenance and support revenues and supplies of third-party hardware and software.
The change in revenue recognition policy has been implemented by way of a prior year adjustment as mandated by International Financial Reporting Standard 1.
This requires the Group to provide comparable figures prepared on a consistent basis for the financial year ended 30 April 2005.
The accounting policy 76 restatement has involved reversing revenues of 76 million, 54 million and 44 million total: 174 million which were recognised in the years ended 30 April 2005, 2004 and 2003 or earlier, respectively.
Those revenues will now be recognised in future years in accordance with the provisions of the new accounting policy.
In calculating the prior year adjustment, note 1 outlines the limitations in the historical data available to the Board.
The Group's policy on revenue recognition is that revenue is recognised only when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured and there are no material outstanding conditions or contingencies attaching to the receipt of monies due.
The Group enters into certain arrangements involving the delivery and implementation of a given software product against predetermined milestones, and the future maintenance and support thereof.
In the case of such arrangements the revenue from the sale of product software licences is not clearly separable from the attendant installation and the revenue for services is recognised on a percentage completion basis over the period of the installation with due regard for future anticipated costs.
Support revenues in this regard are recognised from implementation over the remaining period of the arrangement.
The National Programme contract is a product delivery arrangement with a phased release of functionality enhancements over the period of the arrangement.
The licence revenue is recognised as the elements of the product are delivered.
Implementation and service revenues are recognised in line with the provision of those services, and support revenues on a percentage completion basis over the remainder of the period of the arrangement.
The Group enters into bundled service arrangements whereby it agrees to make certain software applications available for the duration of the arrangement.
As the fair values of the services deliverable and maintenance and support to be provided under such supply arrangements are not clearly separable from the software supply, total revenue in relation to the supply arrangement is recognised on a stage of completion basis over the period of the arrangement, subject to the limitations in historical information available outlined in note 1.
Revenue arising from contract extensions involving the granting of a licence to continue to use installed software for an extended time period is recognised on a straight line basis over the extended period.
Deferred income is recognised in respect of invoices issued and cash received in advance of revenue recognition.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet Financial Statements 2006 Annual Report and Accounts Notes to the financial statements date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences are taken to the profit and loss 02 account.
General information In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and significant and options see below for details of the Group's accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial accounting instruments.
policies On consolidation, results of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rate for the cont... period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the closing year end rate.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are taken to equity.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterlingdenominated assets and liabilities.
Financial instruments 77 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Bank and other borrowings, including discounted receivables financing Interest-bearing bank loans and financing arrangements entered into in respect of specific customer contracts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group's policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the Group balance sheet at fair value.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments at 30 April 2005 and 30 April 2006 was not material.
02 Property, plant and equipment General Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less any applicable discounts.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful life information on a straight-line basis.
The annual rates of depreciation, by category of fixed asset, are as follows: and significant accounting freehold land and buildings 2% policies cont... fixtures, fittings and equipment 12.5% to 20.0% computer equipment 33.3% Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
78 Inventories Inventories comprise goods held for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, 'Share-based Payments'.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 May 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model or Binomial model, as most appropriate for the terms of the instrument.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The cost in relation to the deferred bonus scheme is charged in the year of performance.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet at fair value, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at inception of the lease.
These assets are depreciated in accordance with the Group's normal accounting policy for the class of asset concerned.
The present value of future rentals is shown as a liability.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or Financial Statements 2006 Annual Report and Accounts deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's 02 liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the General balance sheet date.
information and significant Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying accounting amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the policies computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax cont... liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 79 extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Retirement benefit costs For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out on a tri-annual basis and updated at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Multi-employer defined benefit schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes when the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and released to profit and loss account where changes in circumstances indicate that a provision is no longer required.
Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, which are in this note above, management has made judgements that those policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below are detailed in note 1.
02 Key sources of estimation uncertainty General In addition to the matters described in note 1, the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a information material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are and significant discussed below.
accounting policies Impairment of goodwill cont...
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 144.1 million after an impairment charge of 351.4 million was recognised during the year.
Details of the impairment loss calculation are provided in note 11.
Deferred tax Determining whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised in respect of utilisable tax losses requires an estimation of the future taxable profits of the legal entities in which the tax losses reside.
Details of the deferred tax assets recognised are shown in note 13.
80 03 The principal activity of the Group is the development and supply of software application products and Segmental related services to the healthcare sector.
All turnover and profit loss is generated from this activity.

Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 10 85 by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
The weighted average number of shares for the Loss earnings calculation of the diluted loss per share in the year ended 30 April 2006 is the same as that for the basic loss per share per share, because the exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS 33.
Details of options outstanding, which are currently anti-dilutive are included in note 22.
The dilutive effect of options in 2005 was an additional 2,614,000 shares.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2006 2005 '000 '000 UK and Ireland 282,966 282,966 Other European Union 180,667 167,487 Rest of World 31,921 31,202 495,554 481,655 Impairment The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, derived from the present value of future cash flows generated by the CGUs.
There are a number of assumptions and estimates involved in calculating the present value of future cash flows, including but not restricted to the following: growth rates applied to EBITDA, used as the basis for the future cash flows: the long term growth rates for the Group's key markets applied into perpetuity: the discount rate applied to the cash flows to calculate their present value: and the estimated recoverable value for any CGUs which the Board expects to divest within the time frame considered.
Financial Statements 2006 Annual Report and Accounts Notes to the financial statements Although the Board are satisfied that the assumptions used are appropriate to the current circumstances 11 of the Group, changes to these key assumptions or estimates could significantly affect the result of the Intangible impairment calculation.
The basis of the assumptions used is as follows: fixed assets cont... Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
The growth rates are based on management forecasts for the specific markets.
The Group prepares pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management for the next four years and extrapolates cash flows for future periods based on growth rates varying from 0%-5%.
Management consider that the rates used do not exceed the average longterm growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows ranges from 13%-20% and represents management's current best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital in each of the years for which cash forecasts have been discounted.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 144.1 million after an impairment loss of 351.4 million was recognised during the current year.
Other intangibles 87 Other intangibles represent capitalised development costs.
The amortisation period for development costs is dependent on the expected life of the related product release, which is currently estimated at one year.
Acquisition of Novasoft Sanidad S. A.
On 11 October 2005, iSOFT acquired 100% of the Sanidad healthcare operations of Novasoft.
The book values and provisional fair values are as follows: Provisional Book value Revaluations fair value '000 '000 '000 Intangible fixed assets 209 203 6 Tangible fixed assets 86 79 7 Investments 13 - 13 Debtors 5,362 565 4,797 Stock 4 4 - Overdraft 1,867 - 1,867 Corporation tax 56 - 56 Trade and other creditors 3,163 142 3,305 Debt 5 - 5 Net liabilities acquired 583 993 410 Goodwill 13,066 Consideration 12,656 Satisfied by: 470,199 shares issued at fair value 2,039 Acquisition costs 436 Cash 6,123 Intercompany liabilities acquired 1,529 Fair value of deferred consideration 2,529 12,656 Notes to the financial statements 11 No adjustments were required to align the accounting policies of the acquitted entity with those of the Intangible Group.
fixed assets Fair value adjustments comprise: cont... Write off of establishment expenses and intangible assets of 203,000.
Write off of fixed assets with a net book value of 79,000.
Additional provision for bad and doubtful debts of 501,000, together with write off of deferred expenses of 39,000 and irrecoverable Novasoft balances of 25,000.
Write off of obsolete stock of 4,000.
Additional provision for goods and services not invoiced of 74,000 together with additional staff costs of 68,000.
From 11 October 2005 to 30 April 2006, the acquired business contributed 4,419,000 to turnover, 21,000 to loss from operations and 158,000 to loss before taxation.
The post acquisition cash outflow was 1,606,000.
88 In the 12 months ended 30 April 2006 revenue and loss before tax for the acquired entity totalled 8,458,000 and 501,000 respectively.
ii Other acquisitions Further investment in iSOFT R&D Private Limited On 16 August 2005, the Group increased its stake in iSOFT R&D Private Limited iSOFT R&D from 88% to 94% through the issue of 200,000 shares at a fair value of 847,500.
Changes in interests in a controlled entity that do not result in a change of control do not fall within the definition of a business combination under IFRS 3 and accounting for such transactions is not yet covered by any authoritative IASB guidance.
Goodwill arising on this transaction has therefore been calculated as the difference between the consideration paid and the book value of the assets acquired as follows: '000 Consideration - satisfied in shares 848 Additional net assets acquired 418 Goodwill on increase in stake 430 The minority interest shareholders, who are also employees of the Group, hold a put option in respect of their shareholding, whereby the Group may be required to purchase the remaining 6% minority interest at any time between 31 July 2006 and 31 July 2009 for consideration of shares in iSOFT Group plc.
GAP Management AG additional goodwill As part of the Torex acquisition in December 2003, iSOFT accrued 918,000 deferred consideration in respect of the acquisition of GAP Management AG.
All deferred consideration in respect of this transaction was settled by the issue of 294,559 shares in the year at a fair value of 1,032,000.
Additional goodwill of 114,000 arose as a result of the transaction.
HAS PTY intellectual property As part of the Torex acquisition in December 2003, iSOFT acquired rights to market certain products with a royalty payable to a third-party.
An additional payment of 289,000 was made to buy out the third-party arrangement.
The profits and cash flows arising from the other acquisitions are not material to the Group.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 9,222,000 2005: 55,186,000 of such losses and timing differences.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the remaining 59,847,000 losses as their utilisation cannot be considered more likely than not.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
Allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Group's principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Credit risk is focused on a small number of high value contracts, which are long-term in nature.
Outside these contracts the potential exposure is spread over a large number of customers.

assets and Receipts and payments are made in these respective currencies in the normal course of business.
Liquidity risk It is the Group's policy to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with its bankers.
Flexibility is achieved by the use of a revolving credit facility and a fixed term loan facility.
Since the year end the Group agreed revised terms for its facilities with its bankers, details of which are set out below.
At the balance sheet date the Group had a term loan of 39,000,000 and a multi-currency revolving credit facility of 105,000,000.
The term loan is repayable in quarterly payments which commenced in August 2004 with the final payment scheduled for September 2008.
The revolving credit facility was also subject to review in September 2008.
As at 30 April 2006, 789,000 of the revolving credit facility was unused by the Group.
Revision of bank facilities In August 2006, the Group secured the revision of 141 million of facilities.
The facilities following the revision include: 95 105 million revolving credit facility: 36 million term loan facility with no further amortisation: and 25 million facility, available following disposal of non-core assets The maturity date of the above facilities has been revised to 14 November 2007.
The financial terms have also been amended to better reflect the Group's revised business expectations and revenue recognition policies.
Warrants over 3.7% of the issued Share Capital of the business are to be granted to the lender with an exercise price of 10 pence per share as a condition of the new facilities.
The warrants will be exercisable between issue and 36 months from the date of the revision of the facilities, however any shares acquired on exercise cannot be sold until six months following the date of the revision of the facilities.
An exit fee of 15 million is payable at the end of the facility, on refinancing or on change of control of the Company, and if the warrants are not issued prior to 31 October 2006.
If the warrants are issued prior to 31 October 2006 then no exit fee is payable.
The issue of these warrants will require shareholder approval, which will be sought at the AGM.
Additionally, further fees are payable on facilities outstanding post 31 December 2006.
These additional fees are payable at the end of the facility term or, if earlier, at the date of any refinancing of the facilities.
These fees, calculated on the total facility available, are 5.0% per annum for the three months to 31 March 2007, 7.5% per annum for the three months to 30 June 2007, and 10.0% per annum thereafter.
The costs of refinancing are not included in the financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2006 and are estimated to include an amendment fee of 1.2 million, the write off of 0.6 million in unamortised fees and professional fees of approximately 1.0 million.
The cost of interest will increase in accordance with the revised margins.
Margins on debt will now range between 200 and 450 basis points depending on the usage of different elements of the facilities.
The financial covenants applicable to the revised facilities relate to key performance indicators KPIs such as rolling EBITDA and the reduction in letters of credit.
To assist in the monitoring of the KPIs, further financial and non-financial information are to be provided to the lenders on a periodic basis.
In addition the facilities may be terminated in the event of certain actual or threatened litigation, termination of material contracts or the exercise of step in rights.
As part of the revision to the facilities a waiver of any prior breaches of covenants has been provided.
The directors have undertaken to pursue a refinancing of the Group and, if satisfactory progress is not made in the remainder of the current financial year, will explore the other strategic options open to the Group including the disposal of some or all of the Group's business.
The new terms will provide the Group with a period of stability during which the corporate finance strategy of the Group can be considered and executed as required by the banking agreements.
Additionally the revised banking agreements include mandatory prepayments relating to planned disposals, additional covenants relating to material contracts, additional reporting requirements and waivers of any previous breaches of financial covenants.

The assets of the Torex Medical Systems TMS defined benefit pension scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Full actuarial valuations of the scheme are schemes undertaken on a tri-annual basis.
The last completed full actuarial valuation was at 1 January 2005.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme for IAS 19 disclosures was at 30 April 2006.
The IAS 19 valuation of the TMS scheme used the projected unit method and was carried out by KPMG, professionally qualified actuaries, using the following assumptions: 2006 2005 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.0 4.3 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferment 2.9 2.8 Discount rate 5.25 5.4 Inflation assumption 2.9 2.8 98 Uplift on liabilities for mortality assumptions 5.0 5.0 The fair value of the assets of the scheme and the weighted average expected return were: Long term rate of Long term rate of return expected Value at return expected Value at at 30 April 30 April at 30 April 30 April 2006 2006 2005 2005 % '000 % '000 Equities 7.5 12,723 7.5 9,626 Bonds 4.7 1,372 4.7 1,179 Insurance policy 5.0 1,319 5.0 1,256 Other 3.75 833 3.75 751 Total market value of assets 16,247 12,812 Present value of scheme liabilities 26,959 21,979 Deficit in the scheme 10,712 9,167 The long-term rate of return expected on the various classes of scheme asset is set out above.
For bonds and cash balance the market yields at the balance sheet date are known and the overall expected rate for bonds will therefore reflect the actual portfolio of bonds held by the scheme.
For equities the future yield is subjective.
It is usually expected that the long term return on equities will be higher than the return from bonds as a result of the equity-risk premium.
The rates have remained unchanged year on year as the yield on Government bonds has been relatively unchanged.

28 Capital commitments Notes to the financial statements 29 Through the subsidiary company iSOFT plc The Company, the Group entered into two principal Contingent contracts the Contracts to deliver software and services as part of the National Programme for IT NPfIT.
On 2 April 2004, the Company signed a contract with Accenture UK Limited Accenture, a liabilities Local Service Provider LSP, to deliver software and services to the North-East and East Midlands clusters arising under the Accenture Agreement.
On 28 April 2004, the Company signed a contract with CSC Computer National Programme Sciences Limited CSC, an LSP, to deliver software and services to the North-West and West Midlands for IT cluster the CSC Agreement.
Details of the commercial situation surrounding these agreements are given in the Finance Review on pages 18 and 19.
A number of difficulties experienced on the programme are outside the Company's control, but some have resulted in formal correspondence being exchanged between the Company and both Accenture and CSC, alleging material contractual breach by the Company.
The Company has denied all of the disputed allegations of breach.
To date, none of this correspondence has resulted in notice to terminate the Contracts being given, or any formal claims being made.
The Company has registered claims for additional work done outside the scope of the basic contracts.
The Company has taken legal advice from Ashurst on these matters.
However, due to the complexity and 106 nature of the contracts there are differences in the interpretation of functional requirements and their delivery and, in the absence of any formal claim, it is not possible to establish the likelihood nor the quantum of any potential liability.
Having reviewed the legal advice the Board has taken the view that, in view of the complexity of the potential claims and counter claims, a commercial settlement is the most likely outcome.
Given this position and the existence of receivables due for contractual services performed, no specific provision has been made in relation to this matter.
Were any claims to be brought against the Company, the Board would continue to dispute the liabilities and would defend the Company's position vigorously.
Whilst no claims have been made, claims are contractually limited to 1 in respect of Accenture, 5 million per annum for liquidated damages by way of delay deductions and otherwise to 15 million per annum in aggregate: and 2 in respect of CSC, 4 million per annum for liquidated damages by way of delay deductions and otherwise to 18 million per annum in aggregate, with an overall cap of 50 million.
On 11 August 2006, iSOFT signed a Memorandum of Understanding MOU with CSC confirming the schedule under which it will provide deliveries to CSC up to a value of 153 million, including 36 million already delivered, in respect of the CSC Agreement, subject to the satisfactory achievement of delivery milestones, with the opportunity to win additional NPfIT business in future through CSC in certain circumstances.
Under this agreement, iSOFT has made a number of commitments in respect to the future development of its products for the NPfIT and the costs that it will bear for that work and CSC will have step-in rights to support that development work in the event that iSOFT is unable to meet its material milestones or fulfil its obligations.
30 On 31 May 2006 the Group disposed of the iSOFT Switzerland GmbH to Nexus Medizinesoftware und Systeme AG for gross consideration of 807,000.
Subsequent events In May 2006 the Group announced a cost reduction plan in respect of its UK operations.
It is anticipated that savings of 6,000,000 per annum will be achieved on an annualised basis with a reduction of approximately 150 in employee numbers.
The total cost of action already in hand to reduce the cost base, which will be taken as a one-time charge in the year ending 30 April 2007, is estimated to be at least 7 million.
In August 2006 the Group confirmed the revision of its existing bank facilities for a further period of 15 months.
Details of these revisions are included in note 19.

IFRS Reconciliation of equity at 30 April 2005 date of last GAAP financial statements.
adjustments cont... On 27 October 2005, the Group published financial information for the year ended 30 April 2005 restated for the adoption of IFRS.
A copy of that release is available on the Group's website at www.
Since the publication of that information, an additional change has come to light and has been reflected in the comparative financial information contained in these financial statements.
The change, in respect of the period ended 30 April 2005, comprises the reclassification of accruals of 2,735,000 to share based payment reserve.
The impact on the income statement and balance sheet for the year to 30 April 2005 is set out below.
This pro-forma also incorporates adjustments arising from the transition to IFRS recognised since IFRS 109 reconciliations were published on 8 December 2005.
Explanatory notes relating to the IFRS adjustments applied to the reconciliation of equity at 30 April 2005 1.
Goodwill - goodwill has been frozen at the brought forward written down value as at 1 May 2004 and the UK GAAP amortisation charge for the year ended 30 April 2005 reversed to increase intangible assets and profit for the year by 25,221,000.
Other intangible assets - development costs of 4,357,000 have been capitalised, including 2,003,000 capitalised in 2004, within other intangible assets.
The amortisation charge in the period was 2,003,000.
The net increase in other intangible assets is therefore 2,354,000.
Property, plant and equipment - certain leases have been capitalised at a value of 1,249,000 in accordance with IAS 17 with the related liability being included as finance lease liabilities due within one year 761,000 and after one year 525,000.
Deferred tax asset - restated in accordance with IAS 12 to include deferred tax arising on: '000 Reclassification from retirement benefit obligation 2,750 Rolled over gains on asset disposals 2,299 Share based payments 2,420 Capitalisation of development costs 706 Other timing differences 116 2,049 The deferred taxation asset historically netted off the liability on the defined benefit pension scheme has been reclassified to deferred tax assets in accordance with IAS 12.
Gains subject to rollover relief were not provided for under UK GAAP where the gain had been deferred on a semi-permanent basis.
IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be provided irrespective of whether there is an intention to sell the asset that the gains are rolled into.
Differences in timing between the recognition of accounting charges and corporation tax deductions under IAS now create temporary differences resulting in deferred tax rather than a permanent difference under UK GAAP.
IAS 12 applies to all share-based payments and is not time restricted to those issued post 1 November 2002.
The capitalisation of development costs has resulted in the creation of a deferred tax liability.

The finance costs of 233,000 relate to interest in respect of operating leases reclassified as finance leases in accordance with IAS 17.
The net capitalised development cost is the net effect of the capitalisation of development costs in the year of 2,354,000 and the amortisation of development costs previously capitalised of 2,003,000.
Finance cost - the 225,000 charge arises from interest on finance leases 3.
Tax - the additional credit of 138,000 under IAS 12 represents the change in deferred tax arising from the IFRS adjustments between the two balance sheet dates.

Independent auditors' report to the members of iSOFT Group plc We have audited the individual Company financial statements of iSOFT Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2006 which comprise the balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 13.
These individual company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
The corporate governance statement and the directors' remuneration report are included in the Group annual report of iSOFT Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2006.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of iSOFT Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2006 and on the information in the Report of the Directors that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors' responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the individual Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards United Kingdom Generally 116 Accepted Accounting Practice are set out in the statement of directors' responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the individual company financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the individual Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, and whether the individual Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the individual Company financial statements.
We also report to you if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the Report of the Directors and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year as described in the contents section and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the individual Company financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland issued by the Auditing Practices Board, except the scope of our work was limited as explained below.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the individual Company financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the individual Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the individual Company financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
However, the evidence available to us was limited because of the following significant matters: Carrying value of investments in, and amounts due from, subsidiary undertakings, together with all other assets and liabilities Arising from the limitations in audit scope detailed in our report on the Group financial statements on pages 61 to 64, in particular the investigations into accounting irregularities in respect of subsidiary undertakings, together with the detail given in notes 1 and 2 of the Group financial statements, sufficient and appropriate audit evidence is not available to determine the carrying values of investments in, and amounts due from, subsidiary undertakings, together with all other assets and liabilities included in the individual Company balance sheet.
In the absence of any alternative evidence available to us, we have been unable to form a view on any possible adjustments to the financial statements that might have been determined had the limitations not existed.
Financial Statements 2006 Annual Report and Accounts Going concern As detailed in note 1 to the Group financial statements, the directors recognise that there are material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue in operation.
Having taken into account these material uncertainties, the directors consider it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Company on the going concern basis.
In the circumstances of the Group and the Company, we have been unable to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the reasonableness of the directors' assumptions regarding the identified material uncertainties.
As a result, and in the absence of any alternative evidence available to us, we have been unable to form a view as to the applicability of the going concern basis for the Company, together with the effect on the individual company financial statements should this basis be inappropriate.
Any such adjustments would include writing down the carrying value of assets, including investments in subsidiary undertakings, to their recoverable amount and providing for any further liabilities that might arise.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the individual Company financial statements.
Opinion: disclaimer on view given by individual Company financial statements Because of the possible effects of the limitations in evidence available to us, we are unable to form an opinion 117 as to whether: the individual Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the company's affairs as at 30 April 2006: and the individual Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 including comparative information.
In respect of the limitations of our work referred to above we have not obtained all the information and explanations that we considered necessary for the purposes of our audit.
In our opinion, having regard to our disclaimer of opinion set out above, the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the financial statements.
The information given in the Report of the Directors includes that specific information presented in the Financial Review, Report of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Corporate Social Responsibility Statement that are cross-referred from the Business Review section of the Report of the Directors.

Basis of accounting 01 The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
Significant They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United accounting Kingdom Accounting standards and law.
In preparing these individual company financial statements, the policies significant limitations and circumstances set out in note 1 to Group financial statements were taken into account.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year with the exceptions of FRS 20 and FRS 21 which have been applied for the first time in this reporting period and prior year balances restated accordingly.
Impact of new FRS The following new accounting standards have also been adopted in the year but have had no impact on the financial statements: FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement FRS 28 Corresponding amounts 119 ii.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less any applicable discounts.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of tangible assets over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
The annual rates of depreciation, by category of fixed asset, are as follows: office equipment, fixtures and fittings 12.5% to 20.0% iv.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20, 'Share-based Payments'.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 May 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioral considerations.
v. Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any write down for impairment.
Leased assets Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, where the timing differences result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Timing differences arise because of differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Notes to the financial statements 01 Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the timing Significant differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the accounting balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
policies Where law or accounting standards require gains and losses to be recognised in the statement of total cont... recognised gains and losses, the related taxation is also taken directly to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pensions The Company operates a defined contribution scheme.
The pension charge shown represents the total contributions made by the Company for the year.
Significant accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, which are detailed above, management has made judgements that the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements relate to the assumptions on valuation of investments and intercompany loan accounts.
Management have reviewed the carrying value of investments in the balance sheet as at 30 April 2006.
