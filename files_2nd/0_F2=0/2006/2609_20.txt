NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 Changes in accounting policies and presentation The results for the year to 31 March 2006 have incorporated the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS allows an entity, for financial instruments, to produce comparative information, under previous UK GAAP.
However, for the first IFRS reporting period, being 31 March 2006, the adjustment between the balance sheet at the comparative periods reporting date under the previous GAAP and the balance sheet at the start of the first IFRS reporting period must be accounted for as a change in accounting policy.
The Group has taken advantage of this exemption and has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 April 2005.
The impact of these standards on the Groups opening balance sheet is shown below.
The principal impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the Groups financial statements relates to the classification of redeemable preference shares and the recognition of derivative financial instruments.
