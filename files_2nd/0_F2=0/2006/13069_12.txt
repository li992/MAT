RECKITT 23-64:RECKITT 23-64 7 3 07 02:03 Page 31 Notes to the accounts 1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Segmental information is presented in respect of the Groups geographical and product group segments.
The primary segment, geographical areas, is based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
The individual operations based in the countries within each geographic segment are considered to have similar operational risk and generate a similar level of financial return for the Group.
Inter-segment revenues are charged according to internally agreed pricing terms that are designed to be equivalent to an arms length basis, and have been consistently applied throughout 2005 and 2006.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one accounting period.
Primary Segment by Geographical Areas For management purposes the Group is currently organised into three operating areas: Europe: North America, Australia and New Zealand NAA : and Developing Markets and geographical segmental information is presented on this basis.
Segment revenue is based on the geographic location of the Groups customers and segment assets are based on the geographic location of the assets.

The Group has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Notes Scope: Executive Share Awards including Share Options awarded under the 1999 Share Option Plan and Restricted Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan are awarded to the Top 400 Management Group.
Other Share Awards represent SAYE Schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Individual tranches of these awards are not material for detailed disclosure therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
Contractual Life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three-year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2005 or 2006 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
The weighted average share price for the year was 20.88 2005 17.00.
Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 35 RECKITT 23-64:RECKITT 23-64 7 3 07 02:03 Page 36 Notes to the accounts continued 4 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED d Pension and other post-retirement commitments The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally of the funded type.
The Groups two most significant defined benefit pension schemes UK and US are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement schemes in certain countries.
The major scheme is in the US US retiree healthcare scheme, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree healthcare benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
As at 31 December 2006 there were 2,827 2005 2,816 eligible retirees and 1,414 2005 1,470 current employees potentially eligible.
Pension costs for the year are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Defined contribution schemes 15 11 Defined benefit schemes net charge 9 14 Total pension costs recognised in the income statement Note 2 24 25 For the UK scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2004 and updated at 31 December 2006.
For the US scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2005 and updated at 31 December 2006.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the three major schemes as at 31 December 2006 were: 2006 2005 US US US US UK pension medical UK pension medical %%% %%% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.0 5.0 4.8 5.0 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred pensions 3.0 2.8 Discount rate 5.1 5.8 5.8 4.8 5.5 5.5 Inflation assumption 3.0 3.0 2.8 4.0 Annual medical cost inflation 10.5-4.5 10.5-4.5 Long-term expected rate of return on: Equities 7.4 10.7 7.4 10.8 Bonds 4.7 4.5 4.3 5.0 Other 5.9 5.9 The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on PMA92 and PFA92 tables, with allowance for projected improvements in mortality rates in 2004.
In addition, the net discount rate has been reduced by 0.25% to allow for further improvements in mortality.
Impact of medical cost trends rates A one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects: 1% -1% m m Effect on service cost and interest cost 1 1 Effect on post-retirement benefit obligation 12 10 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2006 2005 US US US US UK pension medical Other Total UK pension medical Other Total m m m m m m m m m m Total equities 388 74 18 480 354 83 23 460 Total bonds 214 39 20 273 217 43 14 274 Total other assets 91 6 97 79 5 84 Fair value of plan assets 693 113 44 850 650 126 42 818 Present value of scheme liabilities 691 119 99 149 1,058 700 136 107 129 1,072 Net liability asset recognised in the balance sheet 2 6 99 105 208 50 10 107 87 254 Other represents the total of post-retirement benefits and Group defined benefit scheme not material for individual disclosure.

Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has three categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Executive Options, Employee Sharesave schemes and Convertible Capital Bonds converted in 2005.
The options only dilute earnings when they result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the share and when all performance criteria if applicable have been met.
As at 31 December 2006 there were 17.3m 2005 14m of Executive Share Options not included within the dilution because the contingent performance targets had not been met.
The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2006 2005 Profit for Average Earnings Profit for Average Earnings the year number of per share the year number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 674 720,685,570 93.5 669 727,061,855 92.0 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding 12,365,411 13,496,383 and Executive Restricted Share Plan Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 1,145,515 726,783 Dilution for Convertible Capital Bonds outstanding 1,970,687 On a diluted basis 674 734,196,496 91.8 669 743,255,708 90.0 After the appropriate tax adjustment, the profit adjustment represents the coupon on Convertible Capital Bonds.
The earnings per share impact reflects the effect of that profit adjustment and the assumption of the issue of shares on conversion of bonds.
Adjusted Basis The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2006 2005 Profit for Average Earnings Profit for Average Earnings the year number of per share the year number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 786 720,685,570 109.1 669 727,061,855 92.0 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding 12,365,411 13,496,383 and Executive Restricted Share Plan Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 1,145,515 726,783 Dilution for Convertible Capital Bonds outstanding 1,970,687 On a diluted basis 786 734,196,496 107.1 669 743,255,708 90.0 The Directors believe that a diluted earnings per ordinary share, adjusted for the impact of the restructuring charge after the appropriate tax amount, provides the most meaningful measure of earnings per ordinary share.

The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and accordingly are subject to an annual impairment review.
A number of small non-core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.

Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections based on historical operating results, short-term budgets, medium-term business plans five years and longer-term extrapolation.
The long-term extrapolations assume a growth rate of no more than the long-term inflation assumption for the relevant markets range of 2%-6%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11% 2005 11% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.

V. to form Reckitt Benckiser plc.
This transaction was accounted for as a merger.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedge transactions that are extant at year end.
The capital redemption reserve is required to maintain the Groups capital following the Groups market purchases and subsequent cancellations of the Companys share capital.
The reserve consists of the nominal value of the shares purchased and cancelled see Note 20.
The foreign currency translation reserve contains the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Groups foreign operations that are not considered integral to the operations of the parent company, arising when the Groups entities are consolidated.
The reserve also contains the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net exposure in a foreign currency.

Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has dollar-denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of net investment in its subsidiaries in the USA.
The carrying value of the dollar borrowings at 31 December 2006 was 58m 2005 67m.
The foreign exchange gain of 9m 2005 loss of 7m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in foreign currency translation reserve.
This hedge is used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries in the USA.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term borrowings approximate to book value.

This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2006 the acquisition contributed 494m to net revenues.
Had the acquisition taken place at 1 January 2006, it would have contributed 546m to net revenues.
Disclosure of operating profit information for the acquisition is considered by management to be impracticable due to the extent of integration into the combined Group.
As such one combined business is providing the profits rather than two separate businesses.
Similarly disclosure of cash flows from the acquired business is considered by management to be impracticable as they are derived from one combined business.
All assets and liabilities were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
