Lattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed above.
The executive options have a market based performance condition attached and hence the assumptions are disclosed separately.
The Group uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model: seperate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behaviour are considered separately for valuation purposes.
The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding: the range given above results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behaviour.
Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities as determined by a simple average of no less than three international banks excluding the highest and lowest numbers.
The risk-free rates for periods within the contractual life of the option are based on the UK gilt yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
Shares used for the Groups employee incentive plans can be newly issued shares, shares held in treasury or market purchased shares either through the Company's employee benefit trust or direct from the market or a combination of sources.
The source of the shares is determined by the Company having regard to what is considered the most efficient source at the relevant time.
Some share awards have an attached market condition, based on Total Shareholder Return TSR, which is taken into account when calculating fair value of the share awards.
The valuation methodology for the TSR was based on Vodafones ranking within the same group of companies where possible over the past 10 years.
The volatility of the ranking over a three year period was used to determine the probability weighted percentage number of shares that could be expected to vest and hence affect fair value.
Other information The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year 2006 was 0.30 2005: 0.34.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended 31 March 2006 was 164 million 2005: 28 million.
The aggregate intrinsic value of fully vested share options outstanding at the year end was 68 million and the aggregate intrinsic value of fully vested share options exercisable at the year end was 58 million.
Cash received from the exercise of options under share options schemes was 356 million and the tax benefit realised from options exercised during the annual period was 24 million.
The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended 31 March 2006 was 18 million 2005: 5 million.
