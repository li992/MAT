29 Explanation of transition to Adopted IFRSs As stated in note 1, these are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRSs.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 October 2004 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to Adopted IFRSs has affected the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following notes and tables.
Business Combinations and Intangible Assets adjustment i As stated in note 1 GCap Media has elected not to restate business combinations that occurred before 1 October 2004.
Under IAS 38 goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually.
This results in a statutory increase in profit before tax of 5.1 million for the write-back of goodwill amortisation in the period to 31 March 2005 and a corresponding increase in goodwill on the balance sheet at that date.
Business combinations occurring after 1 October 2004 have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
No business combinations occurred between 1 October 2004 and 31 March 2005.
Since 31 March 2005 the only business combination has been the acquisition of GWR by GCap Media plc formerly Capital Radio on 9 May 2005.
GCap Media plc Annual Report 2005 06 91 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Explanation of transition to Adopted IFRSs continued Employee Benefits Defined benefit schemes adjustment ii At transition, as stated in note 1, GCap Media has elected to recognise in full all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes in equity.
The Group has also elected to adopt the amendment to IAS 19 December 2004 early and recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period they arise.
Under IAS 19, for the period ended 31 March 2005, the statutory operating charge is 0.2 million lower and an additional financing charge is recognised of 0.08 million.
The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes which were both in a deficit position at the transition date.
These deficits totalling 5.0 million are recognised in full in the statutory results on transition to IFRS at 1 October 2004.
At 31 March 2005 the deficits on the balance sheet had increased to 5.4 million, which compares with a net prepayment recognised under SSAP 24 under UK GAAP of 0.3 million.
A corresponding deferred tax asset of 1.6 million at 31 March 2005 has been recognised in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme liability.
Holiday pay adjustment iii IAS 19 requires a liability and an expense to be recognised for paid annual leave.
The Group has therefore recognised an additional accrual for holiday pay of 0.4 million at 31 March 2005.
Share-based Payment adjustment iv As stated above, GCap Media has elected not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to equity instruments that were granted before or on 7 November 2002, or were granted after 7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2005.
GCap Media only had equity-settled share-based instruments: the Group did not have any cash-settled instruments outstanding.
Under IFRS 2 the charge to the income statement for these equity instruments is determined by spreading the fair value of the instruments at grant date over the vesting period.
A calculation is then performed at period end to account for the most current estimate of the number of instruments that will vest taking into account both service and non-market vesting conditions.
The fair value of the instruments is measured under the Monte Carlo, Bi-nomial and Black-Scholes models, depending upon which is the most appropriate model given the terms of the relevant scheme.
UK GAAP charges for these schemes were based on UITF 17, where the difference between the exercise price of the option and the market price of the underlying shares at the date of the grant is recognised as a charge.
Under IFRS 2 the fair value of the equity instrument is recognised as a charge.
As a result there is an increase in the statutory charge under IFRS of 0.6 million for the six months ended 31 March 2005.
There is no impact on the net assets of the Group as this charge is matched by a corresponding increase in equity.
Associates adjustment v The Groups share of associates taxation charge has been reclassified from the taxation line to the share of profit of associates.
This amounts to a statutory adjustment of 0.3 million for the six months to 31 March 2005.
The Groups share of associates interest income has been reclassified from the interest line to the share of the profit of associates.
This amounts to a statutory adjustment of 0.03 million for the six months to 31 March 2005.
Dividends adjustment vi Under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date and similarly under FRS 21 of the same name which applies under UK GAAP for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 dividends are only recognised when they are formally declared, i. e. for interim dividends when paid and for final dividends when authorised by a general meeting.
Accordingly a statutory adjustment has been made.
Dividends of 5.1 million at 31 March 2005 have been reversed and are included in the subsequent period: therefore liabilities have been reduced by this amount.
The amount of dividends approved and paid in the six months to 31 March 2005 was 10.6 million.

There are no other material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRS and the cash flow statement presented under previous GAAP, other than presentational changes.
