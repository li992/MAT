13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 67 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, other than a change in policy from the previous year requiring a restatement of the comparative figures to widen the definition of an investment property see note 13.
The directors have adopted this change as they believe it provides more relevant information on the position of the Group.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties at fair value through the income statement and where IFRSs require an alternative treatment principally in the areas of retirement benefit obligations, share based payments and financial instruments.
In preparing the 2006 financial statements, UK COAL has not applied the following pronouncements for which adoption is not mandatory until the year ending 31 December 2007 and which have not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC11 IFRS2 Group and treasury transactions IAS 1 amendment Presentation of financial statements: Capital disclosures IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures IFRS 8 Operating segments The directors do not anticipate any of the above will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
Consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of UK COAL PLC and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which UK COAL has power to govern the financial and operating policies.
Control is presumed to exist where UK COAL owns more than half of the voting rights, unless in exceptional circumstances it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control.
The consolidated financial statements includes all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries, after eliminating intercompany balances and transactions.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the consolidated income statement up to, or from, the date control passes.
UK COAL uses the purchase method of accounting to consolidate subsidiaries.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities being acquired are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Accounting policies are changed where necessary to bring them into line with those adopted by UK COAL.
The interest any minority shareholders is stated as the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures through which the Group carries on its business are classified as jointly controlled entities and accounted for using the equity method.
Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different to those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products and services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group manages its business primarily by reference to business segments, and this is adopted in the accounting policies as the primary segment.
Deep mining comprises the underground mining operations of the Group.
Surface mining incorporates all mining activities at ground level, together with the plant hire operations of the Group.
The Property division maintains, develops and rents the Groups property portfolio.
The Power division represents that portion of the Group which generates power, either for internal or external sale.
Any activities not falling into any of these categories is included in the other segment.
The Group is based in the United Kingdom.
Its secondary segments are defined as the United Kingdom, Europe other than the United Kingdom and each continent.

Coal transactions Revenue is recognised when delivery of the product or service has been made and when the customer has a legally binding obligation to settle under the terms of the contract and has assumed all significant risks and rewards of ownership.
A large proportion of production is sold under medium to long term contracts.
Revenue is only recognised on individual sales when all of the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
In most instances revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the location specified by the customer, which is typically when despatched, where the customer pays the transportation costs.
Service transactions Rental income is recognised during the period in which rents due to the Group accrue.
Sales of power are recognised when electricity is transferred into the local distribution network.
Exceptional Items Items that are both material and non-recurring and whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure and identification within the consolidated financial statements are referred to as Exceptional Items and disclosed within their relevant income statement category.
Items that may give rise to classification as Exceptional Items include, but are not limited to, significant and material restructuring and reorganisation programmes, asset impairments, profits or losses on the disposal of businesses and income from the Department of Trade and Industry in relation to Investment Aid.
Property related transactions, including changes in the fair value of investment properties, and profits and losses arising on the disposal of property assets, are not included in the definition of Exceptional Items as they are expected to recur, but are separately disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement, where material.
Coal Investment Aid Coal Investment Aid is received as a contribution towards qualifying expenditure, as defined by the Department of Trade and Industry, incurred by UK COAL.
If the expenditure has been charged in the consolidated income statement then the related Investment Aid is credited to the consolidated income statement in the same period.
Where the Investment Aid relates to the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the Investment Aid is held on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income and is credited to the consolidated income statement over the lives of the assets to which it relates.
Investment Properties and Operating Properties The Group holds the following types of freehold property: Working deep mines in production: Working surface mines in production: Land where application for planning to mine has been received: Property held for administrative purposes: Property held for rental income, capital appreciation or both.
Working deep mines in production, working surface mines in production, land where planning to mine has been received, and property held for administrative purposes are held as Operating Properties as these assets are used or intended to be used within the mining operations of the Group and are accounted for at historical depreciated cost and in accordance with IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.
All other freehold properties are held as Investment Properties as these are held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both and are accounted for at valuation and in accordance with IAS 40 Investment property.
Certain freehold property included within property held for rental income has the potential for surface mining, but no application for planning to mine has yet been received.
Investment Properties Investment Properties comprise freehold land and buildings and are measured at fair value.
External, independent valuation firms having appropriate, recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued, value the portfolio annually at the Groups year end.
The fair values are determined by obtaining an independent valuation prepared in accordance with the current edition of the Appraisal and Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 133 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 69 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued In accordance with IAS 40, any difference between the book value of the investment property and the first valuation on recognition as an investment property is taken to reserves.
Subsequent gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement, net of any clawback on deemed disposal.
Investment properties are not depreciated.
Investment Properties with the potential for coal extraction are transferred from Investment Properties to Operating Properties at fair value when application for planning to mine the site has been received.
Where an existing Investment Property is developed for continued use as an Investment Property, no reclassification is made.
Where the development of Investment Property commences with a view to sale, the property is transferred from Investment Properties to inventories at fair value, which is then considered to represent deemed cost.
Investment Property which is held with a view for sale without development is retained within Investment Properties up until derecognition, as defined above.
Operating Properties Operating Properties which are acquired or constructed are initially recorded at cost, which represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into existing use and subsequently stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation other than freehold land which is not depreciated.
Where properties are transferred from Investment Properties to Operating Properties, this transfer is made at fair value, which is then considered to represent deemed cost.
Costs incurred prior to coaling planned for surface mines are held in debtors as deferred costs.
Once coaling has commenced, these costs are transferred to surface mine development and restoration assets and charged to the consolidated income statement net of any residual value over the recoverable reserves of the mine.
Expenditure on sites not expected to be worked within ten years is written off.
During the life of the surface mine property, a separate provision is held in the consolidated balance sheet for outstanding restoration or rehabilitation obligations.
Properties which have historically been used as working deep mines or working surface mines Operating Properties are transferred to property held for rental income or capital appreciation Investment Properties at the point when a decision is made to pursue planning with a view to future development or rental, and mining has ceased.
IAS 16 is applied up to the date of transfer and any difference at that date between the book value and fair value is taken to the revaluation reserve.
Property clawback Under the terms of the privatisation Sale and Purchase Agreement The Agreement, the Department of Trade and Industry is entitled to a percentage of any property gain above certain thresholds and after deducting an amount representing corporation tax thereon accruing, or treated as accruing to UK COAL, as a result of the disposal or deemed disposal of certain properties acquired at privatisation.
The percentage applied is on a declining scale until 31 March 2015, when it reduces to zero.
If properties are disposed of, or are deemed to have been disposed of during this period, a part of the relevant gain will become payable to the Department of Trade and Industry.
A liability for clawback in respect of property disposals is recognised only when an actual or deemed disposal occurs.
A liability for clawback on a deemed disposal as a result of granting a lease is recognised over the life of the lease on a cash received basis.
Clawback is also recognised at the commencement of major developments as defined in The Agreement.
Properties in the course of development Directly attributable costs incurred in the course of developing a property are capitalised as part of the cost of the property.
For Operating Properties amortisation of these costs is done in accordance with the policy for each class of property.
Development costs on Investment Properties are capitalised and the change in value is recognised as part of the next revaluation.
Profit or loss on disposal Disposals are accounted for when legal completion of the sale has occurred or there has been an unconditional exchange of contracts.
Profits or losses on disposal arise from deducting the assets carrying value from the net proceeds being purchase consideration less clawback liability arising on disposal and are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Net carrying value includes valuation in the case of Investment Properties and historic cost less accumulated depreciation in the case of all other property, plant and equipment.
In the case of Investment Properties, the revaluation reserve in relation to the property disposed of is treated as realised on disposal of the property and transferred to retained earnings.
Derecognition Derecognition of Investment and Operating Properties arises on disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use.
69 13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 70 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Plant and equipment The cost of plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in accordance with agreed specifications.
Plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
On conversion to IFRS, UK COAL opted to continue to measure operating property, plant and equipment excluding Investment Properties at historic cost, less accumulated depreciation, in the consolidated balance sheet.
Colliery assets Mine development The purpose of mine development is to establish secure working conditions and infrastructure in order to allow the safe and efficient extraction of recoverable reserves.
Depreciation on mine development is only charged when full production commences or the assets are put to use.
On commencement of full production, depreciation is charged on a tonnageextracted basis over the estimated life of the recoverable reserves.
Coal extracted prior to the commencement of full production is credited against the cost of mine development.
Mines and surface works Assets acquired on the privatisation of British Coal in 1994 were valued at discounted net recoverable amount, based on future mining plans, in accordance with the accounting guidance existing at that time.
Depreciation is charged on a tonnage-extracted basis over the estimated life of the recoverable reserves.
Subsequent additions to mines and surface works are accounted for at cost, and depreciated over their useful lives.
Seismic and geological mapping costs Expenditure on seismic and geological mapping costs which increases the value of the reserves by identifying additional reserves over and above those previously recognised, or increases the value of the existing known reserves by providing information which enables reserve estimates to be increased, is capitalised.
This expenditure is amortised on a unit of production basis over the shorter of four years or the life of the associated reserves.
If the information does not fulfil either of these criteria, the cost is charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Other assets Depreciation The cost of Operating Properties, excluding freehold land, and the cost of all other plant and equipment, less estimated residual value, is written off on a straight-line basis over the assets expected useful life.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Changes to the estimated residual values or useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
Heavy surface mining and other plant and equipment is depreciated at varying rates depending upon its expected usage.
Indicative expected lives are set out below: Freehold land not depreciated Operating properties excluding land 25 to 50 years Mines and surface works Heavy mining equipment 8 to 20 years Plant and machinery Plant and equipment 3 to 15 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Impairment Operating property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles are tested for impairment annually.
The carrying value of cash generating units taking into account related liabilities and allocated central net assets is tested for impairment on a regular basis by comparison with expected relevant future cash flows discounted at the cost of capital taking into account appropriate risk: provision is made for any impairment identified.
Cash generating units comprise individual mines or groups of mines depending upon the nature of the income streams derived from each.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use being the present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit or fair value less costs to sell.
Where there is no binding sale agreement or active market, fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available to reflect the amount UK COAL could receive for the cash generating unit in an arms length transaction.
13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 133 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 71 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Future cash flows are based on: estimates of the quantities of the reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction: anticipated production levels and costs: and anticipated coal prices.
The impairment testing is carried out under the principles described in IAS 36 Impairment of assets which includes a number of restrictions on the future cash flows that can be recognised in respect of restructurings and improvement related to capital expenditure.
Hire purchases and leases as lessee Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to UK COAL are treated as finance leases.
All other leases are treated as operating leases.
Assets held under hire purchase and finance lease arrangements are capitalised and written off according to the depreciation rate of the applicable asset category.
The outstanding capital obligations are included in creditors.
Interest is allocated to accounting periods during the hire purchase or lease term to reflect a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Costs in respect of the operating leases are charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Hire purchases and leases as lessor The Group grants leases over land and buildings in the course of its property business.
These do not substantially transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, and therefore they are accounted for as operating leases.
Financial instruments On transition to IFRS UK COAL elected to adopt IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement with effect from 1 January 2005.
This allowed the recognition of derivatives for the first time in 2005 and did not require prior year figures to be restated.
UK COAL recognises financial instruments when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive the cash flows expire or it has transferred the financial asset and the economic benefit of the cash flows.
Financial liabilites are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial instruments are used to support UK COALs trading operations.
Interest is charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred or earned.
Issue costs of debt instruments are charged to the consolidated income statement over the term of the debt.
From time to time, UK COAL holds derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.
Derivatives are designated as hedges, when applicable, and treated as such from the inception of the relevant contracts.
Gains or losses on hedging instruments are recognised when the hedged transaction occurs.
Gains or losses arising from cancellation of hedging instruments due to the termination of the underlying transaction are taken to the consolidated income statement immediately.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swap agreements are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
UK COAL applied IAS 32 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement with effect from 1 January 2005.
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39 financial instruments are recorded initially at cost.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows: a Financial assets liabilities held for trading or short term gain, including derivatives and embedded derivatives other than hedging instruments, are measured at fair value and movements in fair value are credited charged to the consolidated income statement in the period.
b Held to maturity investments, including those with a fixed maturity date, are measured at amortised cost.
c Loans and receivables payables and non-derivative financial assets liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, are measured at amortised cost.
These are included in current assets liabilities except for instruments that mature after more than 12 months which are included in non current assets liabilities.
71 13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 72 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued d Available-for-sale financial assets, which are either those designated for sale or those not classified in any of the other categories, are measured at fair value.
Movements in fair values are recognised directly in equity and these instruments are included in non current assets unless the intention is to dispose of them within 12 months.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of UK COAL is sterling.
Transactions in other currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at year end exchange rates and the resulting exchange rate differences are included in the consolidated income statement within the results of operating activities if arising from trading activities and within finance cost income if arising from financing.
For consolidation purposes, income and expense items are included in the consolidated income statement at average rates, and assets and liabilities are translated at year end exchange rates.
Where foreign operations are disposed of, the cumulative exchange differences of that foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Values of spares and consumables are based on average purchase prices.
Appropriate provisions are made for slow-moving and obsolete stock.
Coal is recognised as stock when delivered to the surface and is valued at the average cost of extraction.
Cash and cash equivalents In the preparation of UK COALs cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents represent short term, liquid investments which are readily realisable.
Cash held to match liabilities which is subject to restriction is included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet.
Restoration and closure costs Surface mines The total cost of reinstatement of soil excavation is recognised as a provision on site commissioning when the obligation arises.
The amount provided represents the discounted net present value of the expected costs.
Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs.
An asset is created within property, plant and equipment at an amount equal to the initial provision.
This is depreciated on a unit of production basis over the recoverable reserves of the scheme.
Rehabilitation costs, which will be incurred after coal extraction and restoration of the site, are provided for over the recoverable reserves of the scheme on a unit extraction basis and represent the discounted net present value of the liability incurred at the balance sheet date.
Deep mines Closure costs relating to shaft treatment and pit top restoration are recognised as a provision on a discounted basis at colliery commissioning stage or on acquisition.
Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs for the year.
An equivalent asset is created within property, plant and equipment at an amount equal to the initial provision.
Costs of restoring spoil heaps are provided for on acquisition to the extent that an obligation has been incurred and, thereafter, on a unit of production basis as the additional obligation arises.
Provision for other colliery closure costs is made only when there is a demonstrable commitment to the colliery closure.
Other Provisions Pumping costs Pumping costs are provided where there is a legal requirement to continue pumping activities at certain mines following closure and at other pumping facilities for a period into the future.
The provision is based on current experience and is calculated using the discounted net present value of future estimated costs.
Pumping costs on continuing operations are expensed as incurred.
13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 133 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 73 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Ground and groundwater contamination A provision is established for the estimated costs of rectifying ground and groundwater contamination when a legal or constructive obligation is identified and can be quantified.
Surface damage Provision is made for the estimated cost of settlement of surface damage claims based on detailed mining plans, taking into account surface and geological conditions.
The provision is calculated in respect of each colliery, location of mining activity and type of property affected or likely to be affected based on claims expected and submitted and using historical settlement experience.
The provision made represents the discounted net present value of the expenditure required to settle the current or estimated prospective obligation.
Employer and public liability claims UK COAL has established a Department of Trade and Industry approved insurance subsidiary Harworth Insurance Company Limited.
Provision is made for the estimated value of both known, and incurred but not reported, third party claims on an actuarially determined basis.
Where these claims are expected to be settled over a longer period of time, the provision made represents the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Redundancy Provision is made for redundancy costs when there is a demonstrable commitment to terminate the employment of either an employee or group of employees.
The full amount of redundancy payments, including amounts in respect of ex gratia payments, are provided where this has been communicated to employees.
Where contributions to redundancy costs have been firmly committed by third parties, these contributions are credited to the consolidated income statement in the same period, to the extent that the related redundancy cost has been recognised.
Employee Benefits Pension obligations The Group operates defined contribution schemes in respect of all employees who joined after the privatisation date in 1994.
The cost of this is charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
The Group also operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The majority of the employees within defined benefit schemes are members of industry wide schemes, being either the Industry Wide Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme IWCSSS or the Industry Wide Mineworkers Pension Scheme IWMPS, both of which commenced on privatisation following the Coal Industry Act 1994.
The assets of the Schemes are held separately from those of UK COAL, being funds administered by Trustees of the Schemes.
A qualified actuary updates the costs of the Schemes annually under the provisions of IAS 19, and carries out a full valuation triennially.
UK COAL accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value and plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Service costs are charged systematically over the service lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Concessionary fuel Provision is made for the estimated liability arising from the obligation to provide concessionary fuel benefits to retired employees.
The costs of the concessionary fuel benefits are determined annually by a qualified actuary.
The arrangement is unfunded so no assets are held directly to meet the obligations.
The regular service cost and interest on the scheme liabilities are charged to the consolidated income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are charged to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, representing the difference between actual and expected performance.
Share based payments The fair value of share plans is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement over the expected vesting period of the grant.
The fair value of share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market based vesting conditions attached to the award.
Non-market based vesting conditions e. g. earnings per share targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed regularly and the expense charged adjusted accordingly.
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using an industry accepted simulation model.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium any increment when the options are exercised.
73 13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 74 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued On conversion to IFRS, UK COAL, in recognising fair values of share-based payments to employees, chose to apply the exemption only to include those awards made after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 31 December 2003 in its calculations at the date of transition.
Taxation Current Tax The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year adjusted for items that are either not subject to taxation or for expenditure which cannot be deducted in computing the tax charge.
The tax charge is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary imbalances in the tax charge, arising from differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all taxable temporary differences, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
In deciding whether future reversal is more likely than not, the directors review the Groups future forecasts and make a prudent estimate of the aggregate deferred tax asset that should be recognised.
This aggregate deferred tax asset is then allocated into the different categories of deferred tax, taking account of the fact that the deferred tax asset in relation to the pension deficit will be recognised over a longer period, as the pension liability reverses over the average remaining service life of employees.
In relation to investment properties, a deferred tax liability is provided on the basis of normal income tax rules for the proportion of the propertys carrying amount expected to be recovered through use and is provided using capital gains tax rules in respect of the remainder of the propertys carrying amount including all land expected to be recovered through sale.
In the case of the latter, no liability is recognised where the Group has sufficient unrecognised capital losses to cover the future tax obligations arising from these gains.
Provision is made for gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except where it applies to items credited or charged to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Emissions Trading Scheme Income arising from reductions in carbon emissions to the atmosphere as part of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme is credited to the consolidated income statement within other operating income in the year in which the credits are earned to the extent that it is virtually certain that the income entitlement is established.
Surplus credits above this entitlement are not valued and are therefore not recognised in the Financial statements until such time as they are sold to third parties.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are capitalised and written off over the term of the associated borrowings.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend Distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which the dividends are paid in the case of interim dividends or approved by the Companys shareholders in the case of final dividends.
Significant judgements Management exercises significant judgement in the determination of the provisions required in respect of restoration and closure costs.
Amounts provided are based on management experience and historical out turns, together with such external expert assistance as is deemed appropriate.
13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 133 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 75 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Key assumptions and estimates Amounts in the consolidated financial statements that are subject to significant estimates are as follows: a Investment Property Valuations.
The fair value of investment property reflects, amongst other things, rental income from our current leases and assumptions about rental income from future leases, in light of current market conditions.
A change in fair values could have a material impact on the Groups results.
These are subject to actuarial estimates of, among other items, rate of return on investments, rate of salary increases, rate of price inflation and post retirement life expectancy.
Details of the significant estimates used are set out in note 24. c Mine development costs.
Capitalised mine development costs deep and surface mines are amortised over the expected tonnage of coal to be extracted in the future.
If the amount of coal expected to be extracted varies, this will impact on the amount of the asset which should be carried in the consolidated balance sheet.
Provisions are established in the consolidated balance sheet in proportion to the expected coal to be extracted from a site.
If that expected tonnage varies, then the provision may be under or over stated.
The provisions are disclosed in note 22. e Deferred taxation.
The recognition of deferred tax assets requires considerable judgement as to the future profitability of the mining business.
The recognition of a deferred tax liability in relation to property revaluations requires an estimate to be made of the proportion of the value of a property which will be recovered through use, compared to the proportion of the value which will be recovered through sale.
In the case of the latter, the Group does not recognise any tax liability as a result of the significant brought forward capital losses, as disclosed in note 9.

In February 2007, one deep mine at Maltby has been sold.
Subsequent to this, the Group has proven reserves of around 40 million tonnes, employing around 2,900 people in deep mining.
During 2006, mining operations were mothballed at Harworth and closed at Rossington.
These are described as the closed deep mines in the segmental notes to the financial statements for 2006 and 2005.
Surface mining The Group has four active surface mines and planning consent to mine a further site.
Surface mine reserves of 14 million tonnes have either already been granted for mining, applied for or are planned for application during 2007.
Property The Group has a portfolio of around 47,500 acres of predominantly agricultural land and has identified some 2,650 acres of this land as offering prime prospects for a mix of business park, residential, distribution and community development.
Power Generation The Group has established its own power generation business, which utilises waste gas from mines to generate electricity and is actively pursuing the development of alternative power generation opportunities, including wind farms.
Other This includes any activities not already included within one of the above segments and the results of joint ventures.

In the year, attempts to develop a new face and to salvage the mining equipment proved unsuccessful.
As a result, abortive development costs of 2,940,000, net salvage costs of 2,467,000 and post coaling costs of 4,857,000 were incurred.
b In addition to the above, the remaining assets of the Harworth Colliery were written off of 3,589,000. c The decision was taken during 2005 to mothball the Harworth Colliery: the assets were reviewed, giving rise to an impairment of 967,000. d The decision was taken to mothball, and later to close, the Rossington Colliery during 2006.
In the year, post coaling costs of 4,809,000 were incurred.
e In addition to the above, the remaining assets of the Rossington Colliery were written off in 2006 of 203,000. f The decision was taken during 2005 to mothball, and later to close, the Rossington Colliery: the assets were reviewed, giving rise to an impairment of 5,634,000. g In light of deep mine closures during the year, a strategic review was undertaken of the expected future utilisation of stores equipment.
As a result, a provision was created against the carrying value of these items of 6,527,000 2005: 4,696,000. h Costs in relation to redundancies announced prior to the year end have been recognised during the year of 1,995,000 2005: 24,249,000. i A one-off gain arose as a result of the reduction in the Groups liability to provide post retirement benefits in respect of employees leaving UK COALs employment during the year of 4,355,000 2005: 5,180,000. j During 2005, post coaling costs were incurred at the Ellington Colliery following the cessation of mining operations in January 2005. k During 2005, a provision release was recognised in relation to a difference between costs incurred on the cessation of coaling and the commencement of restoration work at Selby.
Other Exceptional Items l In July 2006 a major roof fall occurred at Maltby Colliery, resulting in the inability to mine for 3 months and the invocation of the force majeure clause of certain coal supply contracts.
Net mining costs during this period have therefore been treated as exceptional costs of 6,973,000. m Costs incurred related to health and safety incidents at Daw Mill of 2,392,000. n An impairment provision release arose following the disposal of surface mining plant during the year of 4,400,000. o During 2005, additional labour costs were incurred at Rossington and Kellingley consequent to the revised mining plans following invocation of the force majeure clause within certain coal supply contracts.
p During 2005, costs were incurred following an approach from a consortium looking to acquire the Company.
It comprised fees from property advisers, lawyers and financial advisers.
q Coal investment aid receivable under the Government Aid Scheme of 7,892,000 2005: 17,143,000.
This scheme has now closed for new applications.
r In 2005, a provision was created against the Coal Investment Aid debtor in relation to payments which were being challenged as a result of the closure or mothballing of collieries, or revised mining plans.
s During 2005 a profit was earned on the disposal of the Monckton business.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforced right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
However, the Group is unable to offset any of its deferred tax liabilities at either the 2005 or 2006 year end.

Other deferred tax assets have not been recognised owing to the uncertainty as to their recoverability.
If these deferred tax assets were recognised the total asset would be 110.4million 2005: 109.6 million as set out below.

No tax liability has been recognised in relation to the balance of the gain which is expected to be realised through sale, due to the fact that the Group has unrecognised capital losses brought forward of 431.5 million 2005: 431.5 million.
The deferred tax asset charged to equity during the year is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Restated Deferred tax asset in respect of retirement benefit liabilities 35,752 In addition, in equity a deferred tax liability of 1.1 million has been recognised in relation to the prior year adjustment relating to investment properties note 13.
The Company has no recognised or unrecognised deferred tax in 2006 and 2005.
10 LOSS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys income statement has not been included separately in these financial statements.
11 DIVIDENDS During 2005 a final dividend of 1 pence per share was paid in relation to the Groups performance in 2004.
The total dividend paid amounted to 1,483,000.
No dividends have been paid or proposed in relation to 2006.

In calculating diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the diluting effect of share options being potentially issuable under the Groups employee share option plans.
If the inclusion of these dilutive shares would reduce the diluted profit loss per share, they are disregarded.

At the year end there were no future share options outstanding which could dilute earnings per share.
13 OPERATING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT In order to provide more relevant information in relation to the Groups property portfolio, the directors have widened the categories of property recognised as investment properties.
This change in accounting policy has led to a restatement of the Groups prior year consolidated income statement, consolidated balance sheet and statement of changes in shareholders equity.
Other property, plant and equipment is subject to a floating charge to cover either liabilities due to the Coal Authority or bank borrowings.

The properties were valued during the year, in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, by Atisreal, Smiths Gore and Bell Ingram, independent firms with relevant experience of valuations of this nature.
The valuation excludes any deduction of rehabilitation and restoration costs which are stated within provisions in the balance sheet.
Key assumptions within the basis of fair value are: The sites will be cleared of redundant buildings, levelled and prepared ready for development: The values are on a basis that no material environmental contamination exists on the subject or adjoining sites, or where this is present the sites will be remediated by UK COAL to a standard consistent with the intended use: and No deduction or adjustment has been made in relation to clawback provisions, or other taxes which may be payable.
Certain of the Groups borrowings are secured by a fixed charge over the investment properties.

It should be noted that these are based on the information available at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared and are subject to a number of estimates and uncertainties, as noted below.
This included a charge of 2.0 million 2005: 29.6 million in respect of Exceptional Items and a release of 0.5 million 2005: 2.8 million in respect of non exceptional items.
A brief description of the nature of the Groups obligations and an indication of the uncertainties surrounding each of the above provisions is provided below: Employer and public liabilities provisions are made for current and estimated obligations in respect of claims made by employees and the general public relating to accident or disease as a result of the business activities of the Group.
This is covered by dedicated cash deposits in note 19.
Surface damage provision is made for the Groups liability to compensate for subsidence damage arising from past mining operations.
Claims can be lodged by the public up to six years after the date of relevant damage.
The estimate is based on historical claims experience, following a detailed assessment of the nature of damage foreseen.
Claims where surface mine sites owned by the Group are mined by external contractors and mining conditions vary from those specified in the contract, the external contractors may be entitled to claim further costs incurred.
Claims are settled with individual contractors, generally at the completion of a surface mining site.
All claims provisions are based on known mining conditions encountered, historical experience and contracted rates.
Restoration and closure costs of surface mines provisions are made for the total costs of reinstatement of soil excavation and for surface restoration, such as topsoil replacement and landscaping.
Costs become payable after coal mining has been completed.
Further liabilities for aftercare can extend after restoration, for a period of up to six years.
13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 133 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 95 22 PROVISIONS continued Restoration and closure costs of deep mines: Shaft treatment and pit top provisions are made to meet the Groups liability to fill and cap all mine shafts and return pit top areas to a condition consistent with the required planning permission.
No liabilities will arise until decommissioning of each individual colliery.
The current pit top provision reflects existing planning permissions that require pit areas to be restored to former use, usually agricultural.
The Group will, where possible, seek planning permission for development use, which, if successful, may reduce the expected cost.
Spoil heaps provisions are made for the costs payable to bring spoil heaps to a condition consistent with required planning permission and to complete approved restoration schemes.
An element of spoil heap restoration is ongoing, although the majority of costs will be incurred on decommissioning of a colliery.
Pumping costs there is a legal requirement to continue pumping activities at certain mine sites following closure and for a period into the future.
The provision is based on current experience and the net present value of future cost projections.
Ground groundwater contamination provisions are made for the Groups legal or constructive obligation to address ground and groundwater pollutants at its operating sites.
The provision is based on estimates of volumes of contaminated soil and the historical contract costs of ground contamination treatment.
These costs will usually be incurred on the decommissioning of a site.
Redundancy provision is made for current estimated future costs of redundancy and ex gratia payments to be made where this has been communicated to those employees concerned.
23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups overall strategy and policy in respect of treasury and liquidity is set out in the Directors Report and the Operating and Financial Review.
Strategies, Objectives and Policies The Groups strategy includes maintaining committed facilities which provide adequate cover over peak anticipated borrowing requirements.
The existing banking agreements include covenants on interest cover, EBITDA and net asset levels and a maximum gearing of 50%.
At the year end the Groups net gearing for the purposes of calculating the covenant was 11% 2005: 26%.
Consequently, these disclosures focus on the financial instruments which play a role in the financial risk profile of the Group on a medium to long term basis.
The Groups policy is not to trade in derivatives and only to use these instruments where it reduces risk from contracted sales.
Emissions Trading At 31 December 2006 the Group held 305,849 tCO e 2005: 157,187 tCO e allowances over and above those required 2 2 allowances to meet its annual obligation under the scheme rules.
These have not been attributed a book value or fair value as there is no readily ascertainable market value due to the embryonic status of the UK carbon credit market.
Foreign currency risk No foreign exchange contracts were entered into during 2006 and the Group does not have any material foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate swaps The principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 December 2006, was 55 million 2005: 17 million.
At 31 December 2006 the average fixed interest rate was 4.82% and the floating rate was 5.20%.
Their fair value, assessed by reference to market values, is set out below.

Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations, using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuations were at 31 December 2003.
The assumptions which usually have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are the discount rate, which is based on bond yields, and the rates of increases in salaries and pensions.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations of the UK COAL sections of each scheme were as follows: 2006 2005 Discount rate 5.10% pa 4.70% pa Rate of return on investments 7.00% pa 7.00% pa Rate of salary increases 3.10% pa 2.70% pa Rate of price inflation 3.10% pa 2.70% pa Rate of return on equities 7.00% pa 7.00% pa Rate of return on debt 5.10% pa 4.70% pa Rate of cash commutation 22.5% pa 20.0% pa Pensions in payment are assumed to increase in line with price inflation.
Post retirement mortality has been estimated using applicable standard mortality tables.
Normal health and ill health pensioners have been rated up by between one and three years and by five years respectively for the IWCSS, and by between two and eight years for the IWMPS.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is based on a historic view of the yields from equities and the rates prevailing on applicable bonds at the balance sheet date.
None of the pension schemes owns any shares in the Company.
The amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement are: 2006 2005 000 000 Current service cost 14,185 12,802 Interest cost 19,905 18,053 Expected return on plan assets 20,577 16,109 Effect of curtailment or settlement 3,025 2,191 10,488 12,555 The above amounts are charged to cost of sales, except for the interest cost, which is included in administrative expenses.
A 12.5 million gain 2005: 10.3 million loss has been taken to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in the year.
This represents the net effect of experience and actuarial gains and losses on the schemes in the year.
