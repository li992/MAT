Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to costs and selling prices during the period and the continuing relationship with key brand partners.
Management estimates discount rates using the weighted average cost of capital of the Group, adjusted for any risks specific to the CGUs.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next three years.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates that do not exceed the long term growth rate for the relevant market.
