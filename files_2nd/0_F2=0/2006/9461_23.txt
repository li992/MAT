Consolidated financial statements LogicaCMG Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5.
Restatement of balance sheet at 31 December 2005 and income statement for the year ended 31 December 2005 Following the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations which permit the group 12 months to nalise the fair values of the net assets acquired, the provisional fair values for the Edinfor acquisition acquired on 20 April 2005 were nalised.
As a result, the groups share of the fair value of net assets acquired decreased by 2.0 million and the goodwill increased by the same amount, compared to the amounts previously reported at 31 December 2005.
The decrease of 2.0 million is analysed as follows: m Investments in associates 0.1 Trade and other receivables 1.0 Trade and other payables 2.3 3.4 Minority interests 1.4 Decrease in share of net assets acquired 2.0 During 2005, the group purchased an associate interest in Unilog S. A. and its subsidiaries Unilog.
IAS 28 Investments in Associates requires that the group accounts for its share of the amortisation of the identi able intangible assets of an associate based on their fair value at the date of the initial purchase.
Due to the short time period between the date of purchase of the associate interest in Unilog and the date of approval of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, the groups share of the post-tax pro t of Unilog did not contain an amortisation charge for certain intangible assets, including brand names, customer contracts relationships and some software products.
The fair values of these intangible assets were subsequently nalised in 2006 and a restatement of the share of the post-tax pro t of Unilog for the period 25 October to 31 December 2005 has been made.
The post-tax effect of the amortisation charge was to reduce the share of the post-tax pro ts from associates in the income statement by 0.8 million and to reduce the carrying value of investment in associates in the balance sheet by the same amount.
Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased from 7.4 pence per share to 7.3 pence per share as a result of the restatements above.
Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share did not require restatement.
The effect of these restatements on shareholders equity and total equity as at 31 December 2005 was as follows: m Shareholders equity at 31 December 2005 820.1 Decrease in share of post-tax pro t from associates 0.8 Total shareholders equity 819.3 Minority interests at 31 December 2005 18.6 Decrease in minority interest due to nalisation of fair values of Edinfor 1.4 Total equity 836.5 6.
