Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan In addition to the schemes detailed above, the Company has introduced the Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan TBO under which executives have the opportunity to receive a supplemental bonus of up to 100% of their base salary in respect of any financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels of performance.
The TBO will operate in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan.
Any bonuses earned under the TBO will be payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those shares being awarded and the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.
Release of the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee has committed that the TBO will not be operated in respect of years after 2007 08.
There are currently no grants outstanding under the TBO.
The first grants under the TBO will be made shortly, having been approved at the Remuneration Committee of 23 May 2006.
Measurement of fair value The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the year.
An adjusted market value method of valuation, based on market value at grant date, adjusted for expected forfeitures and market-based performance conditions has been used to calculate the fair value of all other awards i. e. LTIP and RSP awards.
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous 10 years and on the implied volatility of traded options of the Companys shares.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share-based payment expense The Company recognised total expenses of 3 million 2005: 3 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
13 Events after the balance sheet date Proposed refinancing A refinancing will shortly be proposed including an underwritten rights issue and the restructuring of the Companys senior debt facilities, details of which are to be sent to shareholders.
The refinancing will be conditional, inter alia, on shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on 14 June 2006.
