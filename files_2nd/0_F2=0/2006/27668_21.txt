The adjustments to include long-term business on a statutory solvency basis reflect the difference between the net worth of each business on the statutory basis as required by the local regulator and their portion of the Groups consolidated equity shareholders funds.
In South Africa, these values exclude items that are eliminated or shown separately on consolidation such as Nedbank, Mutual & Federal and inter company loans.
For some European territories the value excludes deferred acquisition costs which are effectively part of the value of in-force of the business.
The ROEV is calculated as the adjusted operating profit after tax and minority interests of 929 million plus accrued dividends to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities divided by the opening Group embedded value plus 11 12 of the embedded value of Skandia at 1 February 2006.
The impact of marking all debt to market value is an increase of 61 million at 31 December 2006 and a reduction of 62 million at 31 December 2005.

Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 209 European Embedded Value supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 7 Basis of preparation This supplementary information has been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV Principles issued in May 2004 by the European CFO Forum.
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the preparation of this supplementary information.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the position at that date have been prepared on the same basis as that used in the 31 December 2005 EEV supplementary statements subject to the following changes: i the Group embedded value now includes the adjustment for market value of life funds investments in Group equity and debt instruments: and ii the Group embedded value now excludes perpetual preferred callable securities and accrued dividends.
Covered business is defined as long-term business in the primary financial statements.
This business covers traditional life insurance, long-term healthcare and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by the life insurance subsidiaries.
The results of Group companies providing administration and distribution services have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Following the acquisition of Skandia, covered business now includes the traditional life and unit-linked assurance business of Skandia.
Institutional investment platform pension business written in the United Kingdom has been excluded as it is more appropriately classified as mutual fund business.
The results do not include services provided by Group investment management companies.
Unallocated Group holding expenses have been included to the extent that they relate to the covered business.
For South Africa the covered business excludes individual unit trusts and some group market-linked business written by the asset management company through the life company as profits from this business arise in the asset management companies.
The treatment within this supplementary information of all business other than the covered business is the same as the primary financial statements.
Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of the products defined within the covered business.
The embedded value of the covered business is the sum of the shareholders adjusted net worth in respect of the covered business and the value of the in-force covered business.
The Group embedded value includes the value of all other business at the book value detailed in the primary financial statements.
The adjusted embedded value, a measure used by the directors to assess the shareholders interest in the value of the Group, includes the Groups listed banking and general insurance subsidiaries at market value.
The value of deferred consideration due in respect of Black Economic Empowerment partners is also included.
The adjusted net worth of the covered business is the market value of shareholders assets held in respect of the covered business, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
The level of required capital of the covered business reflects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business allowing for minimum local statutory requirements or equivalent where there is no local requirement, their internal assessment of the market, insurance and operational risk inherent in the underlying products and the level of capital required by rating agencies in respect of our United States business in order to maintain the desired credit rating.
The level of required capital is on average 147, 278 and 121 per cent of the minimum local statutory requirements in South Africa, United States and Europe respectively as at 31 December 2006.
The free surplus comprises the market value of assets allocated to the covered business in excess of the required capital.
The required capital in respect of the South Africa covered business is partially covered by the market value of the Groups investments in banking and general insurance in South Africa.
On consolidation these investments are shown separately.
The value of in-force covered business is the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate which incorporates a risk margin of the statutory distributable profits to shareholders projected to arise from the in-force covered business on a best estimate basis, less a deduction for the cost of holding the required level of capital.
Statutory distributable profit arises from the difference between amounts charged to policyholders for guarantees, expenses and insurance and the actual experience of these items, together with the investment return earned on shareholders assets.
Allowance has been made for the cost intrinsic value of financial options and guarantees to policyholders in the local statutory reserves according to local requirements.
In South Africa and Europe an investment guarantee reserve on a stochastic basis is included in the local statutory reserves.
A deduction from the value of in-force has been made to allow for the impact of future variability of investment returns on the cost of policyholder financial options and guarantees time-value to the extent that it is not already included in the statutory reserves.
This time-value has been determined using stochastic modelling techniques and represents the difference between the average value of shareholder cash flows under many generated economic scenarios and the deterministic shareholder value under the best estimate assumptions.
In the generated economic scenarios allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different circumstances.
The directors believe that the embedded value of the covered business is broadly market-consistent.

Experience variances were impacted by the one-off historic adjustments announced in September 2006 quarterly results, an increased spend on some key initiatives and negative retention experience in group and healthcare business.
The main operating assumption changes are the positive effects of reduction in the provision for future individual business maintenance expenses, which was offset by an increase in provision for group business terminations and maintenance expenses.
The risk-margin recalibration exercise resulted in a reduction from 2.3 to 2 per cent.
The methodology changes impacting cost of required capital reflects modelling improvements to the required capital which reduced the cost of required capital.
The net transfers from covered business include a provision related to the closure of the unclaimed shares trusts, an increased investment in the Old Mutual plc loan note, the purchase of additional shares in Nedbank, dividend payments, as well as head office expenses.
The embedded value for South Africa is after the adjustment for market value of life funds investments in Group equity and debt instruments.
Return on embedded value is the adjusted operating profit after tax divided by opening embedded value in Rand.

The negative experience variances mainly arose from mortality losses on single premium immediate annuities.
The main operating assumption changes include a strengthening of the assumed rate of usage of the penalty free withdrawal option in the deferred annuity product, strengthening of mortality assumptions on single premium immediate annuities and changes to the credited rates for multi-year guaranteed annuities.
The risk-margin recalibration exercise resulted in a reduction from 3.2 to 3.0 per cent.
The actuarial models used to calculate the embedded value have been replaced and upgraded.
This resulted in a reduction in embedded value of 38 million.
The methodology changes impacting cost of required capital reflects changes in the definition of required capital in OMRe and Old Mutual Bermuda Limited to that appropriate to manage the business.
The transfer to covered business is in respect of capital injections and head office expenses.
Return on embedded value is the adjusted operating profit after tax divided by opening embedded value in US Dollars.

The positive experience variances mainly arose from a higher level of fee income than that assumed, which was partially offset by negative expense variances from the Nordic and Latin America regions.
The main operating assumption changes are a strengthening of persistency assumptions in Europe, and increase in provision for future maintenance expenses in the Nordic and Europe and Latin America regions.
The risk-margin recalibration exercise resulted in a 10 basis points reduction in UK, 10 basis points reduction in the Nordic region, and 10-50 basis points reduction in the Europe and Latin America region.
For Nordic, the risk-margin was then increased by 20 basis points on account of a release of required capital.
The methodology changes impacting cost of required capital mainly reflect a reduction in the amount of required capital in the Nordic region, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
The transfers from covered business include repayment of internal financing arrangements as well as head office expenses.
Return on embedded value is the adjusted operating profit after tax divided by opening embedded value in Sterling.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 214 9 Value of new business after tax The tables below set out the geographic analysis of the value of new business VNB after tax.
Annual premium equivalent APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10 per cent of single premiums.
New business profitability is measured by both the ratio of the VNB to the APE as well as to the present value of new business premiums PVNBP, and shown under APE margin and PVNBP margin below.
PVNBP is defined as the present value of regular premiums plus single premiums for any given period and is calculated on the same assumptions as for the value of new business contribution.

The value of new unit trust linked retirement annuities and pension fund asset management business written by the South Africa long-term business, which amounted to 409 million in the year ended 31 December 2006, is excluded as the profits on this business arise in the asset management business.
The value of new business also excludes premium increases arising from indexation arrangements in respect of existing business, as these are already included in the value of in-force business.
The value of new institutional investment platform pensions business written in the United Kingdom, which amounted to 64 million in the year ended 31 December 2006, is excluded as this is more appropriately classified as mutual fund business.

Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 216 11 Assumptions Introduction The principal assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business and VNB are set out below.
The assumptions are best estimate and actively reviewed.
Both operating profit and VNB are calculated on closing assumptions.
The effect of increases in premiums over the period for policies in-force has been included in the value of in-force business only where such increases are associated with indexation arrangements.
Other increases in premiums of existing policies are included in VNB.
New schemes written on which recurring single premiums are expected to be received on a regular basis are treated as new business.
The annualised premium is recognised as recurring premium new business at inception of the scheme and is determined by annualising the actual premiums received during the year in question.
Subsequent recurring single premiums received in future years are not treated as new business, as these have already been provided for in calculating the value of in-force business.
VNB has been accumulated to the year end.
The sensitivity of the embedded value, the value of in-force and VNB to key assumptions are set out in note 12.

2 Risk-margin is net of the risk allowance for the time-value of financial options and guarantees and for the required capital in excess of statutory minimum.
3 This is the time-value of financial options and guarantees not allowed for in statutory reserves.

Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 217 European Embedded Value supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 11 Assumptions continued At 31 December Europe 2006 United Kingdom Risk-free rate 10 year Government bond 4.6% Cash return 3.6% Equity return 7.5% Property return 6.1% Expense inflation 4.3% 1 Traditional embedded value risk discount rate 7.1% Risk-free rate 4.6% 2 Risk-margin 2.1% 3 Cost of financial options and guarantees 4 Cost of required capital in excess of statutory minimum 0.4% Sweden Risk-free rate 10 year Government bond 3.8% Cash return 2.8% Equity return 6.8% Property return 5.3% Expense inflation 3.1% 1 Traditional embedded value risk discount rate 6.9% Risk-free rate 3.8% 2 Risk-margin 3.1% 3 Cost of financial options and guarantees 4 Cost of required capital in excess of statutory minimum Rest of Europe and Latin America Risk-free rate 10 year Government bond 2.5%-5.5% Cash return 1.5%-4.5% Equity return 5.5%-8.5% Property return 4.0%-7.0% Expense inflation 1.8%-3.0% 1 Traditional embedded value risk discount rate 4.0%-7.5% Risk-free rate 2.5%-5.5% 2 Risk-margin 1.4%-3.1% 3 Cost of financial options and guarantees 4 Cost of required capital in excess of statutory minimum 0.0%-3.0% The pre-tax investment and economic assumptions are updated every three months to reflect the economic conditions prevailing on the valuation date.
Risk-free rates have a duration similar to that of the underlying liabilities.
Equity and property risk premiums incorporate both historical relationships and the directors view of future projected returns in each geography.
The risk-margins have been calculated using a bottom-up market consistent approach, and reflect the distinctive risks of the products in the respective business units.
These risk-margins do not include the risk associated with financial options and guarantees.
Where applicable, rates of future bonuses or crediting rates have been set at levels consistent with the investment return assumptions.
Projected taxation is based on the current tax basis that applies in each country.
For the South Africa business projected taxation is based on the current tax basis that applies in each country.
Full allowance has been made for secondary tax on companies STC that may be payable in South Africa.
Full account has been taken of the impact of capital gains tax.
It has been assumed that 10 per cent of the equity portfolio excluding Group subsidiaries will be traded each year.
The effective tax rate was 35 per cent, except for the investment return on capital for which the attributed tax was derived from the primary accounts.
For the United States full allowance has been made for existing tax attributes of the companies, including the use of existing carry-forwards and preferred tax credit investments.
The effective rate was 33 per cent.
For the Europe businesses, projected tax is based on the current tax rate that applies in each country.
In Sweden, no allowance has been made for additional tax on dividends remitted to the UK.
Tax has however been allowed for on dividends to be remitted to the UK from the Isle of Man.
The effective tax rates for Nordic, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe were a range of 2 to 28 per cent, 29.8 per cent and a range of 9.1 to 43.1 per cent.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 218 11 Assumptions continued Risk-margins The risk-margins were recalibrated as at 31 December 2006.
The risk-margin in each geography above the risk-free rates as at 31 December 2006 for the South African, United States and Europe life covered businesses were 2.0, 3.0 and 1.4 to 3.1 per cent respectively.
Compared to the previous recalibration exercise, the recalibration of risk-margins in South Africa and the United States has resulted in reductions of 30 and 20 basis points, respectively, reflecting the changed mix of business and product design of the new business.
For South Africa, the reduction in risk-margin is also due to the expected cost of financial options and guarantees being provided for in the liabilities, and due to higher equity market levels, higher interest rates and a lower market consistent equity volatility parameters compared to the previous calibration.
The risk-margins for the risk associated with the time-value of financial options and guarantees and the allowance for required capital in excess of the statutory minimum have been presented separately.
Non-economic assumptions The assumed future mortality, morbidity and voluntary discontinuance rates have been based as far as possible on analyses of recent operating experience.
Allowance has been made where appropriate for the effect of expected AIDS-related claims.
The management expenses attributable to life assurance business have been analysed between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business and the maintenance of business in-force.
The future expenses attributable to life assurance business include 32 per cent of the Group holding company expenses, with 13 per cent allocated to South Africa, 4 per cent allocated to United States and 14 per cent allocated to Europe.
The allocation of these expenses aligns to the proportion that the management expenses incurred by the business bears to the total management expenses incurred in the Group.
No allowance has been made for future productivity improvements in the expense assumptions.
Future investment expenses are based on the current scales of fees payable by the life assurance companies to the asset management subsidiaries.
To the extent that these fees include profit margins for the asset management subsidiaries, these margins have not been included in the value of in-force business or VNB.
Required capital For the South Africa business, the required capital is calculated for each of the major business units.
The non-investment items are based on a multiple of the non-investment components of the local Statutory Capital Adequacy Requirements set out in PGN104 issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa ASSA.
The investment item is based on internal models developed for capital allocation and pricing purposes.
The models project assets and liabilities for the business forward for 10 years using stochastically determined investment returns on a realistic basis.
Bonus rates and adjustments to non-vested bonuses are determined using a consistent formula based on a weighted average of past returns and the level of the Bonus Smoothing Account BSA at the time.
To the extent that the BSA falls to lower than normally allowable minimum levels, the shareholder is considered to be required to provide support to the business.
The capital requirement, based on the discounted value of the maximum shareholder support required, is determined using a conditional tail expectation at the 97.5 percentile level the December 2005 calculation was based on the 99th worst percentile case: these are equivalent.
The required capital is invested in local equities, local cash and international cash.
The asset allocation as at 31 December 2006 is 60, 33 and 7 per cent respectively.
The required capital of Old Mutual International, based in Guernsey, is set at the greater of 1 per cent of funds under management and 10 million, a level considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business.
The required capital is invested in short-dated fixed interest assets.
For the United States business, the required capital is based on the multiple of the local Risk Based Capital RBC requirement that management deems necessary to maintain the desired credit rating for the company in question.
The multiples vary by company from 200 to 300 per cent and average 284 per cent as at 31 December 2006.
The required capital for OMNIA Bermuda Limited and Old Mutual Reassurance Ireland Limited in Ireland is based on the level of capital considered by management appropriate to manage the business, which is calculated as 125 per cent of United States RBC calculated on local reserves, subject to a minimum of local statutory requirements.
The required capital for the United States business is invested in fixed interest assets.
For the Europe businesses the required capital reflects the level of capital considered by management appropriate to manage the business, allowing for local minimum statutory requirements.
In certain regions, for example Nordic, statutory capital is partially covered by the deferred acquisition costs which are implicitly included in the value of in-force business rather than the adjusted net worth.
The required capital is invested in short and medium-term fixed interest assets.
"Financial options and guarantees South Africa The time-value of the financial options and guarantees included in the statutory reserves in the Africa businesses have been valued using a random walk, log-normal ""real world"" stochastic asset model that is in keeping with the applicable professional guidance notes issued by ASSA."
The time-value reserves relate mainly to the guarantees detailed below: Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 219 European Embedded Value supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 11 Assumptions continued Financial options and guarantees continued South Africa continued Individual business: A closed block of unit-linked type and with-profit business has an underlying minimum growth rate guarantee 4.28 per cent per annum for life and endowment business and 4.78 per cent per annum for retirement annuity business applicable when calculating death, disability and maturity claims.
A small block of with-profits business guarantees minimum values to the policyholder at a point in time, generally five years from inception.
If the guarantee is not exercised, another guarantee may be set.
A small block of with-profits savings business in Group Schemes that has death guarantees of premiums net of fees plus 4.25 per cent per annum investment return.
Retirement annuities sold prior to June 1997 contain guaranteed annuity options, whereby the policyholder has an option to exchange full retirement proceeds for a minimum level of annuity income at maturity.
In addition, with-profits business has vested bonus guarantees at certain future dates which operate in conjunction with the options and guarantees set out above.
Group business: There is a significant pre-retirement savings with-profits portfolio.
Vested bonuses affect the calculation of benefit payments when a member exits from the scheme as the face value is paid out.
If a scheme terminates, the lower of face and market value is paid out and the vested bonuses are not guaranteed.
A significant with-profits annuity in payment portfolio guarantees annuity payments once declared for the life-time of the annuitant.
Key assumptions: The mean returns and volatilities of the asset classes incorporated in the stochastic asset model are detailed below.
Correlations between asset classes have been based on an internal assessment of historical relationships.
Mean Standard deviation 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 2006 2005 Equity 11.4% 13.8% 22% 22% Property 9.8% 10.3% 15% 15% Fixed interest 20 year 7.9% 8.5% 13% 13% Cash 6.0% 5.6% 3% 3% Means have been calculated using the weighted arithmetic average across all scenarios.
The arithmetic means equivalent to the geometric means that were quoted in the December 2005 Annual Report and Accounts are shown for 2005 in the table above.
Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating returns for the required period in each scenario, taking the natural log of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
This makes the result comparable to implied volatilities quoted in investment markets.
As at 31 December 2006 the investment guarantee reserves held as part of the value of liabilities, which included allowance for reasonable management actions and a realistic take-up rate on guaranteed annuity options, were sufficient to cover the time-value of options and guarantees.
There is therefore no separate cost deduction from the value of in-force business.
In practice, at this year end, the reserves held were demonstrated to be consistent with the value that would be obtained using the model above.
United States The time-value of financial options and guarantees in the United States businesses are valued using a proprietary economic scenario generator.
"A ""real world"" stochastic model has been used with the initial position of the yield curve calibrated to 17 US$ denominated indexlinked government bond prices."
Interest rate scenarios are floored at zero per cent and capped at 30 per cent.
Crediting rates declared for the fixed deferred annuity block of business vest fully.
They are subject to a minimum crediting rate which is specified in the contract.
Minimum surrender values are determined by this rate.
Equity indexed annuities offer minimum crediting rates on the fixed portion of the product, minimum surrender values based on this and credit equity participation annually as a percentage of equity growth subject to a maximum.
This equity participation, which is subject to a minimum of zero per cent therefore vests annually.
The variable annuities offered to off-shore customers through Old Mutual Bermuda can offer minimum death benefit guarantees.
Death benefits are subject to a minimum of the sum invested or value at any anniversary date if greater.
A small proportion of variable annuity clients elect a minimum guaranteed account value on maturity.
Notwithstanding the comments above regarding the vesting of credited interest, deferred annuities are subject to surrender charges as specified in the contracts.
The universal life policies specify a minimum crediting rate to accumulate account balances.
All deferred annuities offer a guaranteed annuitisation option on maturity.
The rates are set conservatively and typically have very low utilisation as customers in the United States value the choice inherent in a lump-sum payment.
The reserves for financial options and guarantees assume that the low historical take-up rates of around 1 per cent per annum will continue into the future, and are therefore insignificant.
Certain of the universal life contracts contain a feature that guarantees that the contract will continue, even if values would otherwise be insufficient, provided the customer has paid at least a stated amount of premium.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 220 11 Assumptions continued Financial options and guarantees continued United States continued The mean returns and volatilities of treasuries along the yield curve are detailed below.
The mean-reversion to higher future interest rates inherent in the model is consistent with long-term historical patterns.
The interest rate scenarios generated by the model range from zero to 30 per cent.
Mean interest rate Standard deviation 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December Treasuries 2006 2005 2006 2005 6 months 4.7% 4.7% 4.3% 2.8% 1 year 4.7% 5.0% 4.3% 2.8% 5 year 4.9% 5.5% 4.1% 2.5% 10 year 5.1% 5.8% 3.9% 2.4% 20 year 5.3% 6.0% 3.0% 2.3% The means are calculated using the unweighted arithmetic average return across all scenarios.
Equivalent arithmetic means to the geometric means quoted in the December 2005 Annual Report and Accounts.
Standard deviations can be calculated by accumulating returns for the required period in each scenario, taking the natural log of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
Europe While certain products within the Europe businesses provide financial options and guarantees, these are immaterial due to the predominantly unit-linked nature of the business except in the Nordic region where the value of certain financial options and guarantees have been taken in the opening fair value adjustments.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 221 European Embedded Value supplementary information For the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 12 Sensitivity tests The tables below for South Africa, United States and Europe show the sensitivity of the embedded value and value of in-force at 31 December 2006 and VNB for the year ended 31 December 2006 to changes in key assumptions.
All calculations include the impact on the time-value reserves necessary for policyholder financial options and guarantees.
For each sensitivity illustrated, all other assumptions have been left unchanged.
The sensitivity showing the impact of one per cent increase in the yield on equities property as a change in the equity property risk premium is not given below as a bottom-up market consistent approach has been adopted for calibrating discount rates.
