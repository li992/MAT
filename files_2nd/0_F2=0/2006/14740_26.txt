INTANGIBLE ASSETS Continued Impairment testing of Goodwill: 2006 2005 Goodwill description Cash-generating unit m m Swalec Generation and Supply i 187.0 187.0 Hornsea SSE Hornsea Limited ii 56.2 56.2 Medway Generation and Supply i 22.2 22.2 Neos Neos Networks Limited iii 7.8 7.8 Connect South West Southern Electric Contracting Ltd iv 0.8 0.8 Eastern Contracting Southern Electric Contracting Ltd iv 0.9 0.9 Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge Generation and Supply i 17.7 17.7 Harrison Smith Batley Southern Electric Contracting Ltd iv 0.8 293.4 292.6 Impairment review on goodwill balances Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
The impairment test involves determining the cash generating unit to which the goodwill belongs and thereafter estimating the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or the value in use.
Value in use calculations have been used to determine the recoverable amounts for the cash generating units noted above.
These are based on five-year projected cash flows extracted from the corporate business model which has been approved by the Executive and the Board.
Discount rates in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% on a pre-tax basis have been applied to those cash flows.
The key assumptions applied in determining the recoverable amounts for the cash generating units are as follows: i Generation and Supply The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill relating to Swalec, Medway and Fiddlers Ferry Ferrybridge is based on an assessment of the recoverable amount of the Generation and Supply business segment.
This segment is managed as an integrated business at gross margin for all aspects of the generation and supply of electricity, and the sale of gas.
In projecting the gross margin for the business, factors such as market demand, market share and forward wholesale energy prices are considered.
Management believes that the assumed margins are reasonably achievable.
The specific goodwill balances relate to the following acquisitions: Swalec was acquired in 2001 and is a supply business serving, primarily, South Wales: Medway, a gas-fired power station, was acquired after the acquisition of the remaining 62.5% shareholding in the power station in November 2003: the Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge coal-fired power stations, were acquired in July 2004. ii SSE Hornsea Limited The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill associated with Hornsea has been carried out based on the recoverable amount of SSE Hornsea Limited.
This is based on projected cash flows which include management estimates of projected demand for gas storage, injection and withdrawal tariffs and wholesale gas prices.
iii Neos Networks Limited The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill associated with Neos has been carried out based on the recoverable amount of Neos Networks Limited.
This is based on projected cash flows which include management estimates of sales growth in the range of 10- 20%.
iv Southern Electric Contracting Limited The impairment test on the carrying value of goodwill related to the acquisitions of Eastern Contracting and Connect South West were based on cash flow projections of the acquiring subsidiary entity, Southern Electric Contracting, which has successfully integrated these businesses into its operations.
Management believes that the assumed margins included in the projections are reasonably achievable.
Scotia Gas Networks investment in gas distribution networks The Groups share of Scotia Gas Networks investment in the gas distribution networks includes an amount of acquired goodwill.
In testing this acquired goodwill for impairment, management believe that both the fair value less costs to sell of the business and the value in use of the cash generating unit support the carrying value of goodwill inherent in the Groups financial statements.
Summary In all cases, management conclude that the projected future cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of the recognised goodwill and the other cash generating unit assets.
Management believe that while cash flow projections are subject to inherent uncertainty, any reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions utilised in assessing recoverable amounts would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units identified.
Goodwill is allocated to the following business segments: 2006 2005 m m Energy Systems Generation and Supply 226.9 226.9 Other businesses 66.5 65.7 293.4 292.6
