Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of the company are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom applicable accounting standards.
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
Changes in accounting policies The company has adopted FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date and FRS 20 Share-based payment.
This adoption represents a change in accounting policy and comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Note 40 details the effects of these changes.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Employee share schemes The company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes under which shares are issued to certain group employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For schemes with only market based performance conditions, those conditions are taken into account in arriving at the fair value at the grant date.
Accordingly no subsequent adjustment to the amortised fair value is made for achievement or otherwise of those conditions.
For schemes that include non-market based conditions or no conditions, a true-up model is applied to the expense at each reporting date based on the expected number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a random walk stochastic model, which takes into account exercise price, share price at date of grant, expected life, expected volatility of the share price, risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield.
The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20 the standard has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
