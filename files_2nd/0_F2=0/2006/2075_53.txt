5041 BHPB AR06 Pt2 13 9 06 10:11 PM Page 227 38 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards The accounting policies set out in this financial report have been applied for the years ended 30 June 2006 and 2005, and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 July 2004.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the BHP Billiton Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial reports prepared in accordance with its previous basis of accounting previous GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from previous UK and Australian GAAP to IFRS has affected the Groups financial position and financial performance is set out in the following tables and accompanying notes.
Because of the DLC structure, the preparation of IFRS financial statements for the BHP Billiton Group requires transition from the two predecessor GAAPs for BHP Billiton Limited which reported under Australian GAAP and BHP Billiton Plc which reported under UK GAAP.
Where necessary, Australian GAAP has been chosen as the reference predecessor GAAP from which to base transition adjustments.
The amounts presented below differ to the amounts presented in the note on the impact of adopting IFRS in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2005.
This follows resolution of the treatment of two items identified in that note as being subject to interpretation and revision.
The amounts in the tables below are presented based on the application of the revised interpretation from the date of transition to IFRS: Royalties and resource rent taxes which are in the nature of an income tax are now measured and presented as income tax in accordance with IAS 12 AASB 112 Income Taxes deferred tax principles.
At 30 June 2005 these were accounted for as operating costs: and Deferred tax liabilities are no longer recorded on non-tax depreciable assets, such as mineral rights, where a tax base exists for capital gains tax, and that tax base exceeds the book base.
At 30 June 2005, a deferred tax liability was recorded by reference to the tax base for income tax purposes.
The following table presents a summary of the impact of IFRS on net equity as at 30 June 2005 and 1 July 2004.

The recognised net asset or liability is subject to changes in value that are more volatile than changes in assets and liabilities that were recognised under the BHP Billiton Groups previous policy, which was based on the UK Statement of Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Under SSAP 24, the cost of providing pensions was charged to profit and loss so as to allocate the cost systematically over the employees service lives on the basis of independent actuarial advice.
A pension liability or asset was consequently recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the contributions payable either lagged or preceded expense recognition.
228 BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2006 5041 BHPB AR06 Pt2 13 9 06 10:11 PM Page 229 38 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued B Deferred tax IAS 12 AASB 112 Income Taxes On transition to IFRS, the balance sheet liability method of tax effect accounting was adopted, rather than the income statement liability method applied under previous BHP Billiton Group policy.
This balance sheet method recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences between the accounting and tax values of balance sheet items, rather than accounting and tax values of items recognised in profit and loss.
This approach gives rise to a wider range of deferred tax assets and liabilities and an increase in the volatility of deferred tax balances brought about by foreign exchange rate movements.
IFRS requires deferred tax to be recognised on items which do not have a tax base, such as certain mineral rights and fair value adjustments on acquisitions, and for tax on unremitted earnings from subsidiaries and joint ventures except to the extent that the group can control the timing of distributions and those distributions are not probable in the foreseeable future.
In addition, royalty arrangements which are in the nature of income tax have been measured and presented as income tax in accordance with IAS 12 AASB 112 deferred tax accounting principles.
The impact on deferred tax balances of adopting IAS 12 AASB 112, other than the tax effect of other IFRS adjustments, is as follows: UK GAAP to IFRS Australian GAAP to IFRS 30 June 2005 1 Jul 2004 30 June 2005 1 Jul 2004 Tax asset Tax asset Tax asset Tax asset provision provision provision provision US$M US$M US$M US$M Deferred tax on non depreciable assets acquired in business combinations 309 321 309 321 Tax base resets under Australian tax consolidations 188 165 Foreign exchange movements tax base of non-monetary assets 434 216 434 216 Foreign exchange movements US dollar debt 516 255 516 255 Withholding taxes 10 10 Adoption of IAS 12 to jointly controlled entities 13 7 13 7 Remeasurement of royalties as income taxes 32 30 32 30 Recognition of tax losses 450 100 Increase decrease in net deferred tax liability 194 172 68 237 C Goodwill and business combinations IFRS 3 AASB 3 Business Combinations IFRS requires impairment assessments of goodwill, whereas both previous UK and Australian GAAP permitted required the amortisation of goodwill.
Business combinations undertaken after the date of transition to IFRS 1 July 2004 must be accounted for in accordance with IFRS.
The acquisition of WMC Resources Ltd was effective 3 June 2005.
Differences in accounting for the acquisition exist between UK GAAP and IFRS with respect to the measurement of fair value of inventory and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities, and between Australian GAAP and IFRS with respect to deferred tax assets attributable to unused tax losses.
Under previous UK GAAP goodwill existing prior to 1998 was classified as a reduction of retained earnings.
In order to maintain consistency in the IFRS treatment of goodwill in the DLC structure, such goodwill has been reclassified on transition as an asset in the balance sheet in accordance with previous GAAP.
The reclassification of goodwill was required because the IFRS accounting for past business combinations is determined from the previous basis of accounting applied by the Group under previous Australian GAAP, which has been chosen as the reference predecessor GAAP for these purposes.
D Dividend payable IAS 10 AASB 110 Events after the Balance Sheet Date IFRS does not permit the recognition of dividends payable as a liability until the dividend has been formally declared by the Directors.
Under previous UK GAAP, dividends payable were recognised as a liability in the balance sheet at the balance sheet date, despite the fact they were declared subsequent to the balance sheet date.
E Equity based compensation IFRS 2 AASB 2 Share-based Payment Under IFRS the cost of employee compensation provided in the form of equity-based compensation including shares and options is measured based on the fair value of those instruments rather than their intrinsic value as recognised under previous BHP Billiton Group policy.
In addition, the change in the tax base over time is reflected in equity.
F Joint ventures IAS 31 AASB 131 Interests in Joint Ventures Under IFRS as implemented in Australia, all joint ventures that are constituted as a legal entity are accounted for using the equity method.
Under both previous UK and Australian GAAP, the BHP Billiton Groups interests in the Escondida, Mozal and Valesul joint ventures were accounted for by proportional consolidation.
As each of these joint ventures operates through an incorporated entity, IFRS classifies them as jointly controlled entities and the Australian version of IFRS mandates the use of the equity method of accounting, notwithstanding that in substance none of the entities operate as independent business entities.
The change to single line equity accounting for jointly controlled entities does not impact net profit or net equity, however, as demonstrated in the schedules above, the amounts of profit before tax, income tax expense, investments in jointly controlled entities and other balance sheet and income statement line items are significantly affected.
G Royalty related taxation IAS 12 AASB 112 Income Taxes Under IFRS, royalties and resource rent taxes are treated as taxation arrangements when they have the characteristics of a tax.
For such arrangements, current and deferred tax is provided on the same basis as for other forms of taxation.
Under previous UK and Australian GAAP, such taxes were included in operating costs, and in some cases, were not calculated in accordance with deferred tax principles.
Material adjustments to cash flow The use of the equity method of accounting under IFRS for the Groups interests in the Escondida, Mozal and Valesul jointly controlled entities, as compared to proportional consolidation under previous UK and Australian GAAP, has corresponding impacts on the Cash Flow Statement.
Under IFRS, amounts included in dividends received from these jointly controlled entities were previously included elsewhere in cash flows related to operating activities.
In addition capital expenditure and debt repayments for these joint ventures are now excluded from the Groups investing and financing cash flows.
The presentation of the cash flow statement is consistent with previous Australian GAAP, however compared to UK GAAP, the cash flows have been reclassified as operating, investing and financing.
