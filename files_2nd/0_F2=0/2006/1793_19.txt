No deferred tax has been recognised owing to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Of this total, 140m 2005: 160m will expire 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2019.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 130m 2005: 130m and for joint ventures and associates is 11m 2005: nil.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Contributions are determined in accordance with independent actuarial advice.
Details of the IAS 19 valuations are set out in 25.1 below.
Details of the last actuarial valuations and reviews and the assumptions used by the actuaries are set out in 25.2 below.
25.1 IAS 19 valuations The latest actuarial funding valuations of the Groups principal dened benefit schemes have been updated by the actuaries to 31 December 2006 on the basis prescribed by IAS 19.
In particular, scheme liabilities have been discounted using the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond rather than the expected rate of return on the assets in the scheme used in the funding valuations.
Other than the mortality assumptions set out in 25.2, the principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: Balfour Balfour Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Pension Pension Mansell Birse Pension Pension Mansell Fund Scheme schemes scheme Fund Scheme schemes 2006 2006 2006 2006 2005 2005 2005 %%%% %%% Ination rate 3.10 3.10 3.10 3.10 2.80 2.80 2.80 Discount rate 5.15 5.15 5.15 5.15 4.75 4.75 4.75 Future salary increases 4.60 4.60 4.60 4.60 4.30 4.30 4.30 Future pension increases 3.10 3.10 3.10 3.10 2.80 2.80 2.80 Expected return on plan assets 6.35 7.30 6.79 7.36 5.98 7.00 6.60 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Balfour Balfour Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Pension Pension Mansell Birse Other Pension Pension Mansell Other Fund Scheme schemes scheme schemes Total Fund Scheme schemes schemes Total 2006 2006 2006 2006 2006 2006 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 m m m m m m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 1,876 158 210 94 11 2,349 1,806 159 212 14 2,191 Fair value of plan assets 1,688 150 177 62 10 2,087 1,629 136 160 12 1,937 deficit 188 8 33 32 1 262 177 23 52 2 254 Present value of unfunded obligations 26 26 26 26 Liability in the balance sheet 188 8 33 32 27 288 177 23 52 28 280 Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement dened benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which arrangements are closed to new entrants.

The rates of return for each class were determined as follows: equities and property: the rate adopted is consistent with the median assumption used in the actuarys asset modelling work as at 31 December.
bonds: the overall rate has been set to reect the yields available on the gilts and corporate bond holdings held at 31 December.
cash and other net current assets: this class is mostly made up of cash holdings and the rate adopted reects current short-term returns on such deposits.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the dened benefit schemes during 2007 is 41m.
Contributions paid in 2006 for the principal schemes were 24m 2005: 25m for the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, 2m 2005: 1m for the Railways Pension Scheme, 9m 2005: 7m for the Mansell schemes and 1m for the Birse scheme.
The Railways Pension Scheme is a shared cost scheme.
Accordingly the deficit shown above assumes that the Group will obtain economic benefit from, or be required to finance, only a proportion of the surplus or deficit in the Balfour Beatty section of the scheme.
This proportion has been based on the apportionment of the surplus which has already been agreed together with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and Rules and Trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit nancing.
Year end historic information for the Groups post-retirement benefit plans is: 2006 2005 2004 m m m Dened benefit obligation at end of year 2,375 2,217 1,984 Fair value of assets at end of year 2,087 1,937 1,730 Funded status at end of year 288 280 254 Experience adjustment for liabilities 52 24 59 Experience adjustment for assets 21 138 52 25.2 Funding valuations The last formal valuation of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF was carried out by the actuary at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit method and disclosed an excess of assets over past service liabilities of 1.7%.
Due to the size of the membership of the BBPF 38,062 members at 31 December 2006 the schemes actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and is able to make statistically credible comparisons of this experience with the mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables.
The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
As a result of these reviews the Group is able to adopt with a measure of confidence consistent mortality assumptions for its IAS 19 valuations across its various dened benefit schemes.
The mortality tables adopted for these valuations and that of the BBPFs 2004 formal valuation are the 1992 series CMI tables as shown below: With average life Mortality expectancy table at 65 years 1992 series of age Members in receipt of a pension Male PMA92c04 18.4 years Female PFA92c04 21.3 years Members not yet in receipt of a pension Male PMA92c22 20.0 years Female PFA92c22 22.9 years Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme.
The last formal valuation of this dened benefit scheme was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 December 2004 using the projected unit method and disclosed that the market value of the schemes assets represented 92.4% of the benets of which, being a shared cost scheme, the economic cost to the Group is circa 60% as represented in the schemes assets and liabilities shown below.
This proportion has been based on the apportionment of the surplus which has already been agreed together with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and Rules and Trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments.
Mansell plc operates two funded dened benefit schemes, the Mansell plc Pension Scheme and the Hall & Tawse Retirement benefit Plan Mansell schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Mansell plc Pension Scheme, which was closed to new members from 31 December 2001, was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 July 2005 using the projected unit method.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets represented 78.0% of the benets that had accrued to members on an ongoing funding basis.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Hall & Tawse Retirement benefit Plan, which was closed to new members from 1 July 1998, was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 March 2005 using the projected unit method.

Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, payable half-yearly.
Any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable on 1 July 2020 at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 117m at 31 December 2006 2005: 129m.
