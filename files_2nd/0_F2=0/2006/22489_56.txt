Comparison of the 2005 consolidated income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement as now reported under IFRS with those previously reported under UK GAAP i The effective interest rate method has now been applied.
Accordingly certain interest, fees and commissions are now spread, also impacting impairment losses.
ii Share-based awards are now accrued in the balance sheet and expensed in the income statement.
iii Goodwill is now subject to impairment testing, rather than to annual amortisation, and negative goodwill is no longer capitalised.
iv Many of the adjustments referred to in this note have related tax effects, nearly all of which are deferred.
v Minority interests are recognised as equity rather than as a liability and some of the adjustments to the profit and loss account and opening reserves referred to in this note have related minority interest effects.

vii Certain assets previously classified as tangible assets are now classified as intangible assets other.
viii Exchange adjustments are recognised through the exchange movements reserve rather than the profit and loss account.
ix The defined benefits pension scheme deficit is now recognised on the balance sheet.
