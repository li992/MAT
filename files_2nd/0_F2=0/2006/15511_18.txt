Segmental analysis Business segments In January 2006, the Group sold its Telecommunications Equipment and International Services businesses to Ericsson.
Those operations were discontinued with effect from 1 January 2006.
Work is ongoing to complete legal formalities associated with the sale of related shares and assets in a few overseas jurisdictions.
Following the disposal, the Group was reorganised into two Continuing Operating segments Telco Services and Enterprise Services.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Telco Services covers a broad range of services for fixed, mobile and multi-vendor communications networks in the UK, including Network Build, Network Support and Maintenance, Cable Install and Repair and End of Life Management services.
This includes the results of System X hardware and software activity and Payphones business, which were previously reported within Optical & Access Networks.
System X is managed within the Telco Services organisation structure, and the Payphones business was sold in March 2006.
Enterprise Services comprises the provision of services to enterprise network customers, particularly in the government, transportation and utilities sectors in the UK and Germany.
Under certain projects within the German Enterprise Services business, telent installs optical and access equipment.
These sales were previously reported within Optical & Access Networks but are now managed within the Enterprise Services organisation structure.
Discontinued Operations were organised into three operating segments Optical & Access Networks, Data Networks and Other Network Services.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, information relating to Outside Power and Plant OPP, which was disposed of in August 2004, is separately disclosed.
Following the disposal of businesses to Ericsson, which was achieved largely through asset-based transactions, the Group has retained legal entities in overseas territories, which hold legacy balances not transferred to Ericsson.
These legal entities do not trade and are the subject of an ongoing Legal Entity Rationalisation programme.
The results, assets and liabilities associated with these activities are presented as Liability management.
The principal components of Liability management are receivables from and payables to entities sold to Ericsson, legacy trade payables, VAT receivables and payables, accruals for professional fees and environmental, litigation and other provisions.
