Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2006 is estimated to have been $18m.
Acquisition accounting for Tec Products and Westgate was not finalised prior to approval of these financial statements due to the short timeframe involved.
Acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and contributed 151.1m to revenue, 4.2m to operating profit before intangible amortisation and 3.0m to operating profit after intangible amortisation in 2006.
All 2006 acquisitions, together with the two 2007 acquisitions, involved the purchase of 100% of the acquirees share capital or, as the case may be, all of the relevant assets of the businesses acquired.
Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
In connection with this the Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
At the end of the year, the allocation period for the acquisitions completed during 2006 remained open for all acquisitions and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge comes to light that more accurately reflects conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The net impact on acquired net assets reported in 2005 from these adjustments was 1.3m.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2005 has not been restated for these adjustments as they are not considered material.
34 Notes Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2006 26 Acquisitions continued The consideration for the acquisitions has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
