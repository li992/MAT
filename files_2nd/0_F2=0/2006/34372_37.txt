Adjustments to increase the deferred tax liability of 50m, and to recognise other liabilities of 10m have been made to the provisional amounts previously disclosed for the Pillar acquisition.
The Groups revenue for the year ended 31 March 2006 would have been 1,277m if Pillar Property PLC and the BL West group of companies had been acquired on1 April 2005: its profit after taxation would have been 1,220m.
The Groups profit after tax of 1,249m for the year ended 31 March 2006 includes post acquisition profits of 176m for Pillar Property PLC, and 37m for the BLWest group.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill to its recoverable amount.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the Spirit portfolio, Debenhams portfolio and the investment in HUT, are each regarded as cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is based on the fair value less costs to sell, with fair value being determined in the light of external property values.
As a result of these impairment tests, a non-cash impairment charge of 240 million has been recognised to write off goodwill in full.
The Boards in principle decision to become a REIT will result in the derecognition of deferred tax provisions in the foreseeable future.
Further, there has been a substantial rise in the values of the acquired assets.
These two factors have given rise to the goodwill impairment.
