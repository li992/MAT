Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 ACCOUNTING POLICIES i.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historic cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial statements of investment trust companies SORP as issued by the AITC in December 2005.
The Company has adopted certain new accounting policies due to the issue of new financial reporting standards FRSs.
Further details can be found in the accounting policies note below and in note 17.
The SORP and the listing rules have also given rise to some changes in the presentation.
The Statement of Total Return is now called the Income Statement and the total return column, as opposed to the revenue column, is now the profit and loss account of the Company.
There are two new primary statements, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds.
Valuation of investments Investments are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Listed investments are valued at bid market prices.
This represents a change in accounting policy, however, in accordance with the exemption conferred by paragraph 108D of FRS26, comparatives have not been restated.
In prior years, listed investments were valued using last trade prices.
The adoption of bid prices on 1st April 2005 decreased the value of investments by 51,000 as shown in note 8.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted and restricted investments are included at a fair valuation determined by the Directors.
In making its valuations, the Board has taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to the capital reserve realised.
Unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the capital reserve unrealised.
Income Dividends from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis, with overseas dividends being accounted for gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserves.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and treated as a capital item or an income item depending on the facts and circumstances of each dividend.
Stock lending income and interest receivable on deposits is recognised in revenue on an accruals basis.

Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue, with the following exceptions: performance related fees are allocated 100% to capital: management fees are allocated 70% to capital and 30% to revenue, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of revenue and capital returns from the Companys investment portfolio.
In previous years the management fee has been allocated wholly to revenue: expenses incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment, and those incidental to the sale of an investment are deducted from the sales proceeds of the investment.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs, and include items such as stamp duty and broker commissions.
In accordance with FRS 26 and the SORP, disclosure of transaction costs is now required and can be found in note 8. v. Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation and FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 70% to capital and 30% to revenue, in line with the Boards expected longterm split of revenue and capital returns from the Companys investment portfolio.
In previous years, finance costs have been allocated wholly to revenue.
Financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments namely interest rate swaps to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet in accordance with FRS26: Financial instruments: Measurement.
This represents a change in accounting policy, however in accordance with the exemption conferred by paragraph 108D of FRS26, comparatives have not been restated.
Gains or losses arising in the fair value of the cash flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps are taken directly to the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds.
Such gains or losses are taken to a reserve created specifically for that purpose, described as Other Reserve in the Balance Sheet.
Where permitted, the Company has excluded short-term debtors and creditors from the analysis of financial instruments in note 20. vii.
Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19 Deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
In line with the requirements of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate the tax relief on expenses charged to capital is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to capital.
JPMorgan Fleming Continental European 39 Notes to the Accounts continued viii.
Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, have determined the functional currency to be Sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of capital or revenue nature.
Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, final dividends declared but not approved are not accrued in the accounts, since their payment only becomes certain once shareholder approval has been obtained.
As a result, final dividends are now accounted for in the period in which they are approved.
This has led to an increase in net assets at those accounting dates where a final dividend has been declared but not approved.
Further details can be found in note 17.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares with European exposure.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Bank loans denominated in Euros, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: Interest rate swaps, the purpose of which is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the bank loans: Currency contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency exposure of the Company.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Accordingly, it is, the Companys policy that no trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates both foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing each of these risks is summarised below.
Financial instruments continued Market Price Risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on at least five occasions during the year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors.
The Investment Manager has responsibility for selecting investments in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its incremental operations through bank borrowings and retained profits.
The Company borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to both generate the desired interest rate profile and, to manage the Companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, all of the Companys borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
Foreign Currency Risk The income and capital value of the Companys investments can be significantly affected by exchange rate movements as the majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments and monetary assets and liabilities Movements in rates affect short term timing differences: and Movements in rates affect the income received The Company finances part of its, investment activities with Euro borrowings, thereby hedging part of the movements of the value of investments attributable to exchange rate fluctuations.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settled.
This exposure is short-term and therefore, the risk is not significant.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
