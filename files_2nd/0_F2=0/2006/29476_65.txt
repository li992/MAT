208983 St James RA Txt 20 3 07 08:03 Page 121 Notes to the European Embedded Value Basis continued In determining the market-consistent value an appropriate allowance is made to reect the fact that the value of tax relief on expenses does not move linearly with market movements.
The impact of this is assessed using a stochastic simulation model that is regularly calibrated to market conditions.
When calculating the value of new business, priority is given to relieving the expenses relating to that business.
Assumptions a Economic assumptions The principal economic assumptions used within the cash ows at 31 December 2006 are set out below: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 Million Million Risk free rate 4.9% 4.3% Ination rate 3.0% 2.8% Risk discount rate net of tax 8.0% 7.3% Future investment returns: - Gilts 4.9% 4.3% - Equities 7.9% 7.3% - Unit linked funds - Capital growth 4.5% 3.6% - Dividend income 2.8% 3.0% - T otal 7.3% 6.6% Expense ination 3.6% 4.3% Indexation of capital gains 2.2% 2.0% The risk free rate is set by reference to the yield on 10 year gilts.
The other investment returns are set by reference to these.
The ination rate is derived from the implicit ination in the valuation of 10 year index-linked gilts.
This rate is increased by 1.5%, to reect higher increases in earnings and the expense ination assumption is calculated as 80% of earnings ination.
The rate is reduced by 10% to derive the indexation of capital gains for the proportion of the fund invested in equities.
b Experience assumptions The principal experience assumptions have been set on a best estimate basis.
The persistency assumptions are derived from the Groups own experience, or where insufficient data exists, from external industry experience.
Maintenance expenses have been set in line with the costs charged by the Groups third party administrators, together with an allowance for the Groups own maintenance costs.
