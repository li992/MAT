The charge reflects the slower than expected development of the Japanese life business.
D Impairment testing Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to cash generating units CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing.
These CGUs are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
An allocation to CGUs of the Groups goodwill attributable to shareholders is E shown below: 2006 2005 m m M&G 1,153 1,153 Other 188 188 F 1,341 1,341 Other represents goodwill amounts allocated across CGUs in Asia and US operations.
These goodwill amounts are not individually material.
Assessment of whether goodwill may be impaired G With the exception of M&G, the goodwill attributable to shareholders in the balance sheet relates to acquired life businesses.
The Company routinely compares the aggregate of net asset value and acquired goodwill on an IFRS basis of acquired life business with the value of the business as determined using the EEV methodology, as described in note D1.
Any excess of IFRS over EEV carrying value is then compared with EEV basis value of current and projected future new business to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill in the IFRS balance sheet may be impaired.
H Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the CGUs carrying amount, excluding any goodwill, with its recoverable amount.
M&G The recoverable amount for the M&G CGU has been determined by calculating its value in use.
This has been calculated by aggregating the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the component businesses of M&G based upon management I projections and its current surplus capital.
The discounted cash flow valuation has been based on a three-year plan prepared by M&G, and approved by the directors of Prudential plc, and cash flow projections for later years.
As a cross check to the discounted cash flow analysis, a review was undertaken of publicly available information for companies engaged in businesses comparable to the component businesses, including reported market prices for such companies shares.
In addition, a review was undertaken of publicly available terms of transactions involving companies comparable to the component businesses.
In particular, comparison has been made of the valuation multiples implied by the discounted cash flow analysis to current trading multiples of companies comparable to the component businesses, as well as to multiples achieved in precedent transactions.
200 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements H1: Intangible assets attributable to shareholders continued The value in use is particularly sensitive to a number of key assumptions, as follows: i The assumed growth rate on forecast cash flows beyond the terminal year of the budget.
A growth rate of 2.5 per cent has been used to extrapolate beyond the plan period.
A ii The risk discount rate.
Differing discount rates have been applied in accordance with the nature of the individual component businesses.
For retail and institutional business a risk discount rate of 12 per cent has been applied.
This represents the average implied discount rate for comparable UK listed asset managers calculated by reference to risk-free rates, equity risk premiums of five per cent and an average beta factor for relative market risk of comparable UK listed asset managers.
A similarly granular approach has been applied for the other B component businesses of M&G.
iii That asset management contracts continue on similar terms.
Management believes that any reasonable change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of M&G to exceed its recoverable amount.
C Japanese life company As noted above, the entire goodwill relating to the Japanese life operation of 120 million was deemed to be impaired in 2005 following impairment testing carried out.
This testing was based on a recoverable amount for the Japanese company that was determined by calculating its value in use based on net present value cash flow projections.
Such projections reflected existing business over the D expected duration of the contracts and expected new business.
A risk discount rate of five per cent was applied to the projected cash flows.
On the basis of the results of this exercise, all goodwill held in relation to the Japanese business was written off in 2005. b Deferred acquisition costs and acquired in-force value of long-term business contracts attributable to shareholders The recoverable amount for the ventures entities controlled by the Group through PPM Capital has been determined on a portfolio CGU E basis by aggregating fair values calculated for each entity less costs to sell these entities.

All goodwill figures shown above reflect the cost.
These have no impairment losses or other write-offs.
A All goodwill additions relate to the UK and the long-term business segments.
Additional details on the acquisitions are provided in note I6.
The recoverable amount for the venture fund investment subsidiaries controlled by the Group through PPM Capital has been determined on a portfolio CGU basis by aggregating fair values calculated for each entity less costs to sell these entities.
B The fair value of each entity is calculated by PPM Capital in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines which set out industry best practice for determining the fair value of private equity investments.
The guidelines require that an enterprise value is calculated for each investment, typically using an appropriate multiple applied to the Companys maintainable earnings.
All amounts relating to financial instruments ranking higher in a liquidation than those controlled by PPM Capital are then deducted from the enterprise value and a marketability discount applied to the result to give a fair value attributable to the instruments controlled by C PPM Capital.
The marketability discount ranges from 10 per cent to 30 per cent, depending on PPM Capitals level of control over a realisation process.

The UK taxation regime applies separate rules to trading and capital profits and losses.
The distinction between temporary differences that arise from items of either a capital or trading nature may affect the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, for the 2006 results and balance sheet position at 31 December 2006, the possible tax benefit of approximately D 333 million 2005: 333 million, which may arise from capital losses valued at approximately 1.7 billion 2005: 1.7 billion, is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
In addition, a potential deferred tax asset of 71 million 2005: 67 million, which may arise from trading losses of approximately 245 million 2005: 237 million, is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
Liabilities Of the 1,303 million 2005: 962 million current tax liability, it is not practicable to estimate how much is expected to be settled in one E year or less due to the uncertainty over when outstanding issues will be agreed with HM Revenue and Customs.

214 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements H14: Provisions and contingencies continued Legal provisions The legal provisions of 11 million 2005: 11 million relate predominantly to Jackson.
Jackson has been named in civil proceedings, which appear to be substantially similar to other class action litigation brought against many life insurers in the US, alleging misconduct in the sale of insurance products.
During 2006, an additional provision of 3 million was made, 2 million was paid and there was a 1 million A exchange gain.
Restructuring provisions Restructuring provisions of 76 million 2005: 41 million comprise 72 million 2005: 30 million relating to restructuring activity of UK insurance operations, 4 million 2005: 1 million relating to Egg and nil 2005: 10 million relating to closure costs in Japan.
B UK restructuring In 2004 and 2005, Prudential implemented restructurings relating to document management review, streamlining operations, and the relocation of activities to an offshore base in India.
In December 2005, the Group announced an initiative for UK insurance operations to work more closely with Egg and M&G and in the process facilitate the realisation of substantial annualised pre-tax cost savings and C opportunities for revenue synergies.
At 1 January 2005, a provision of 49 million was brought forward, and during 2005 an additional 1 million was provided, 11 million of unused provision was released, and 9 million was paid.
During 2006, an additional provision of 75 million was provided, 4 million of unused provision was released, and 29 million was paid.
D Egg restructuring At 1 January 2005, a provision of 17 million was brought forward relating to Eggs withdrawal from the French market, of which 16 million was used during 2005.
In 2006, as a result of the UK and Egg initiative described above, a provision of 11 million was set up, of which 8 million was used.
E Japan restructuring In 2005, Japan closed its Financial Advisor distribution channel.
A 10 million provision was set up relating to closure and redundancy costs, which was used during 2006.
F Other provisions Other provisions of 155 million 2005: 124 million include provisions of 134 million 2005: 94 million relating to staff benefit schemes.
During 2006, another 78 million was provided, 7 million of unused provision was released, and 31 million was paid.
In 2005, a provision of 77 million was brought forward, an additional 27 million was provided and 10 million was paid.
Other provisions also include 18 million 2005: 19 million relating to various onerous contracts where, in 2006, an additional 1 million was provided and G 2 million was used.
In 2005, 29 million was brought forward, 6 million was released and 4 million was used.
The remaining provisions of 3 million 2005: 11 million include VAT provisions.
Contingencies and related obligations Litigation H In addition to the legal proceedings relating to Jackson mentioned above, the Group is involved in other litigation and regulatory issues arising in the ordinary course of business.
Whilst the outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the directors believe that the ultimate outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
I Pension mis-selling review In 1988, the UK government introduced new pensions legislation intended to encourage more individuals to make their own arrangements for their pensions.
During the period from April 1988 to June 1994, many individuals were advised by insurance companies, Independent Financial Advisers and other intermediaries to not join, to transfer from or to opt out of their occupational pension schemes in favour of private pension products introduced under the UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The UK insurance regulator previously the Personal Investment Authority, now the FSA, subsequently determined that many individuals were incorrectly advised and would have been better off not purchasing the private pension products sold to them.
Industry participants are responsible for compensating the persons to whom private pensions were mis-sold.
As a result, the FSA required that all UK life insurance companies review their potential cases of pension mis-selling and pay compensation to policyholders where necessary and, as a consequence, record a provision for the estimated costs.
The Group met the requirement of the FSA to issue offers to all cases by 30 June 2002.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 215 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued H14: Provisions and contingencies continued The table below summarises the change in the pension mis-selling provision for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 2005.
The change in the provision is included in benefits and claims in the income statement and the movement in unallocated surplus of with-profits funds has been determined accordingly.
2006 2005 A m m Balance at beginning of year 331 487 Change arising from adoption of FRS 27 109 Changes to actuarial assumptions and method of calculation 108 28 B Discount unwind 15 14 Redress to policyholders 48 21 Payment of administrative costs 5 12 Balance at end of year 401 331 C The pension mis-selling provision is included within the liabilities in respect of investment contracts with discretionary participation features under IFRS 4.
The liability accounting for the contracts which are the subject of the mis-selling provision is reflected in two elements, namely the core policyholder liability determined on the basis applied for other contract liabilities and the mis-selling provision.
The overall liability for D these contracts remains appropriate in the context of the accounting for policyholder liabilities that determines the calculation of both elements.
However, the constituent elements are reallocated and remeasured for the changes arising from the application of the realistic Peak 2 basis of liabilities for the core policyholder liability, as reflected in the IFRS policy improvement to apply the UK GAAP standard FRS 27 as described in section A4.
E The change arising from the adoption of FRS 27 in 2005 is due to two factors, namely: i Under the FRS 27 basis, which follows the FSA realistic Peak 2 approach, best estimate assumptions apply.
Previously a margin for adverse deviation was incorporated: and ii The pension mis-selling provision is the additional amount needed i. e. between the value of the guarantees given to policyholders F and the values of the personal pension policies.
The latter item is calculated differently under the previous Peak 1 and Peak 2 bases.
The Peak 1 calculation is deterministic and excludes provision for terminal bonus.
The Peak 2 calculation is stochastic and includes provision for terminal bonus.
The FSA periodically updates the actuarial assumptions to be used in calculating the provision, including interest rates and mortality G assumptions.
The pension mis-selling provision represents the discounted value of future expected payments, including benefit payments and all internal and external legal and administrative costs of adjudicating, processing and settling those claims.
To the extent that amounts have not been paid, the provision increases each year reflecting the shorter period of discount.
The directors believe that, based on current information, the provision, together with future investment return on the assets backing the H provision, will be adequate to cover the costs of pension mis-selling as well as the costs and expenses of the Groups pension review unit established to identify and settle such cases.
Such provision represents the best estimate of probable costs and expenses.
However, there can be no assurance that the current provision level will not need to be increased.
The costs associated with the pension mis-selling review have been met from the inherited estate.
Accordingly, these costs have not been I charged to the asset shares used in the determination of policyholder bonus rates.
Hence policyholders pay-out values have been unaffected by pension mis-selling.
In 1998, Prudential stated that deducting mis-selling costs from the inherited estate would not impact its bonus or investment policy and it gave an assurance that if this unlikely event were to occur, it would make available support to the fund from shareholder resources for as long as the situation continued, so as to ensure that policyholders were not disadvantaged.
The assurance was designed to protect both existing policyholders at the date it was announced, and policyholders who subsequently purchased policies while the pension mis-selling review was continuing.
This review was completed on 30 June 2002.
The assurance will continue to apply to any policy in force at 31 December 2003, both for premiums paid before 1 January 2004, and for subsequent regular premiums including future fixed, RPI or salary related increases and Department of Work and Pensions rebate business.
The assurance has not applied to new business since 1 January 2004.
New business in this context consists of new policies, new members to existing pension schemes plus regular and single premium top-ups, transfers and switches to existing arrangements.
The maximum amount of capital support available under the terms of the assurance will reduce over time as claims are paid on the policies covered by it.
The bonus and investment policy for each type of with-profits policy is the same irrespective of whether or not the assurance applies.
Hence removal of the assurance for new business has had no impact on policyholder returns and this is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
216 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements H14: Provisions and contingencies continued Mortgage endowment products review In common with several other UK insurance companies, the Group used to sell low-cost endowment products related to repayment of residential mortgages.
At sale, the initial sum assured is set at a level such that the projected benefits, including an estimate of the annual bonus receivable over the life of the policy, will equal or exceed the mortgage debt.
Because of a decrease in expected future investment A returns since these products were sold, the FSA is concerned that the maturity value of some of these products will be less than the mortgage debt.
The FSA has worked with insurance companies to devise a programme whereby the companies write to customers indicating whether they may have a possible shortfall and outline the actions that the customers can take to prevent this possibility.
The Group is exposed to mortgage endowment products in respect of policies issued by Scottish Amicable Life plc SAL and policies B issued by Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society SALAS which were transferred into SAIF.
At 31 December 2006, provisions of 5 million 2005: 6 million in SAL and 45 million 2005: 50 million in SAIF were held to cover potential compensation in respect of mortgage endowment product mis-selling claims.
As SAIF is a separate sub-fund of the Prudential Assurance long-term business fund, this provision has no impact on shareholders.
C In addition, in the year ended 31 December 2006 Prudential Assurances main with-profits fund paid compensation of 11 million 2005: 24 million in respect of mortgage endowment products mis-selling claims and at 31 December 2006 held a provision of 60 million 2005: 63 million in respect of further compensation.
The movement in this provision has no impact on the Groups profit before tax.
In May 2006, the Group introduced a deadline for both Prudential and Scottish Amicable mortgage endowment complaints.
Impacted D customers have three years to lodge a mis-selling complaint in line with the time limit prescribed by the FSA and the ABI.
Guaranteed annuities Prudential Assurance used to sell guaranteed annuity products in the UK and at 31 December 2006 held a provision of 47 million 2005: 52 million within the main with-profits fund to honour guarantees on these products.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed E annuities in the UK is through SAIF and at 31 December 2006 a provision of 561 million 2005: 619 million was held in SAIF to honour the guarantees.
As SAIF is a separate sub-fund of the Prudential Assurance long-term business fund, the movement in this provision has no impact on shareholders.
Other matters F Inherited estate of the PAC long-term fund The assets of the main with-profits fund within the long-term fund of PAC comprise the amounts that it expects to pay out to meet its obligations to existing policyholders and an additional amount used as working capital.
The amount payable over time to policyholders from the with-profits fund is equal to the policyholders accumulated asset shares plus any additional payments that may be required by way of smoothing or to meet guarantees.
The balance of the assets of the with-profits fund is called the inherited estate and has G accumulated over many years from various sources.
The inherited estate represents the major part of the working capital of PACs long-term insurance fund.
This enables the Company to support with-profits business by providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees, by providing investment flexibility for the funds assets, by meeting the regulatory capital requirements that demonstrate solvency and by absorbing the costs of significant H events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting the bonus and investment policies.
The size of the inherited estate fluctuates from year to year depending on the investment return and the extent to which it has been required to meet smoothing costs, guarantees and other events.
PAC believes that it would be beneficial if there were greater clarity as to the status of the inherited estate.
As a result, PAC has I announced that it has begun a process to determine whether it can achieve that clarity through a reattribution of the inherited estate.
As part of this process a Policyholder Advocate has been nominated to represent policyholders interests.
This nomination does not mean that a reattribution will occur.
Given the size of the Groups with-profits business any proposal is likely to be time consuming and complex to implement and is likely to involve a payment to policyholders from shareholders funds.
If a reattribution is completed the inherited estate will continue to provide working capital for the long-term insurance fund.
Support for long-term business funds by shareholders funds As a proprietary insurance company, the Group is liable to meet its obligations to policyholders even if the assets of the long-term funds are insufficient to do so.
The assets, represented by the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds, in excess of amounts expected to be paid for future terminal bonuses and related shareholder transfers the excess assets in the long-term funds could be materially depleted over time by, for example, a significant or sustained equity market downturn, costs of significant fundamental strategic change or a material increase in the pension mis-selling provision.
In the unlikely circumstance that the depletion of the excess assets within the longterm fund was such that the Groups ability to satisfy policyholders reasonable expectations was adversely affected, it might become necessary to restrict the annual distribution to shareholders or to contribute shareholders funds to the long-term funds to provide financial support.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 217 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued H14: Provisions and contingencies continued In 1997, the business of SALAS, a mutual society, was transferred to Prudential Assurance.
In effecting the transfer, a separate sub-fund, SAIF, was established within Prudential Assurances long-term business fund.
This sub-fund contains all the with-profits business and all other pension business that was transferred.
No new business has been or will be written in the sub-fund and the sub-fund is managed to ensure that all the invested assets are distributed to SAIF policyholders over the lifetime of SAIF policies.
With the exception of certain A amounts in respect of the unitised with-profits life business, all future earnings arising in SAIF are retained for SAIF policyholders.
Any excess deficiency of revenue over expense within SAIF during a period is offset by a transfer to from the SAIF unallocated surplus.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of SAIF but are entitled to the investment management fees paid on this business.
With the exception of certain guaranteed annuity products mentioned earlier in this note, and certain products which include a minimum B guaranteed rate of accumulation, the majority of SAIF with-profits policies do not guarantee minimum rates of return to policyholders.
Should the assets of SAIF be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations to the policyholders of SAIF, the Prudential Assurance long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency.
Due to the quality and diversity of the assets in SAIF and the ability of SAIF to revise guaranteed benefits in the event of an asset shortfall, the directors believe that the probability of either the Prudential Assurance C long-term fund or the Groups shareholders funds having to contribute to SAIF is remote.
Guarantees and commitments Guarantee funds in both the UK and the US provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance companies.
These guarantee funds are financed by payments assessed on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume, and types of business.
The Group estimated its reserve for future guarantee fund assessments for Jackson to be 9 million at 31 December D 2006 2005: 11 million.
Similar assessments for the UK businesses were not significant.
The directors believe that the reserve is adequate for all anticipated payments for known insolvencies.
Jackson has commitments for future payments related to equity index call options totalling 0.3 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 3 million.
The commitments were entered into in the normal course of business to hedge obligations associated with the issuance E of equity index-linked immediate and deferred annuities.
The final payment is due in 2007.
At 31 December 2006, Jackson has unfunded commitments of 174 million 2005: 227 million related to its investments in limited partnerships and of 38 million 2005: 104 million related to commercial mortgage loans.
