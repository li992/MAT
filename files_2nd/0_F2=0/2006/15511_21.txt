ii During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group recognised curtailment gains of 6 million in relation to previously announced headcount reductions in the UK and as a result of the disposal of the Telecommunications Equipment and International Services businesses to Ericsson.
The Group recognised a further 14 million settlement gain in relation to the termination of one of its US post-retirement medical benefit plans.
iii The net increase in provisions for litigation and indemnities resulted mainly from the creation of provisions for claims received during the year from former employees in the US and CALA regions, partially offset by the release of provisions relating to disposals completed in prior years following the successful settlement of all outstanding claims from the purchaser at a lower level than previously provided.
iv Two major restructuring programmes in the UK were announced during the financial year as well as programmes in certain overseas territories, resulting in a 34 million restructuring charge within Discontinued Operations relating to the associated headcount reductions and site closures.
In addition, an 11 million charge was recorded to cover the impairment of IT systems no longer required within telent following the disposal of businesses to Ericsson.
These were partially offset by a 1 million credit to cost of sales relating to the manufacturing outsourcing arrangements in place within the European supply chain, now transferred to Ericsson.
In the financial year ended 31 March 2005, the 9 million of restructuring and litigation items comprised employee severance costs offset by recoveries from stock, which had been previously written off, and a release of excess litigation provisions following full and final settlement of all outstanding claims under the previously disclosed Telcordia lawsuit.
