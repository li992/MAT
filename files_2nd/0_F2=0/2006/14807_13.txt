page 96 | Stagecoach Group plc Notes to the financial statements Note 1 UK GAAP accounting policies The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by that Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable standards in the United Kingdom.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by FRS 1 Revised, the Company has taken the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement.
Changes in accounting policy The Company has adopted FRS 17, Retirement benefits, FRS 20 Share-based payments, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation and FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly except that the exemption within FRS 25 and FRS 26 not to restate comparatives has been taken.
Details of the effects of the prior year adjustments are given in note 14.
The Company has also adopted FRS 23, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, and FRS 28, Corresponding amounts, in the year.
The adoption of these did not have any impact on the overall reported results.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at their original historic cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment as set out in note 2.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: IT and other equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provision for impairment.
Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement either the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses as the related pre-tax item.
In accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Taxation, full provision is made for deferred tax on a non-discounted basis in respect of all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding sale agreement and undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries.
Deferred tax is calculated at rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent they are more likely than not to be recovered.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
For the principal rates of exchange used see the Group IFRS accounting policies on page 44.
Share based payment The Company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share based payments to certain employees.
The Company has applied the optional exemption contained within FRS 20, which allows it to apply the standard only to share options granted after 7 November 2002 that have not vested before the date of transition, being 1 May 2004.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market based vesting conditions and no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest as a result of a failure to satisfy a non-market based vesting condition.
None of the Groups equity-settled transactions have any market based performance conditions.
Fair value for equity settled share based payments is estimated by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated based on managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest taking into consideration the likelihood of achieving non-market based vesting conditions.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 97 Notes to the financial statements Note 1 UK GAAP accounting policies continued Share based payment continued Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value.
Fair value is estimated initially at the grant date and at each balance sheet date thereafter until the awards are settled.
Market based performance conditions are taken into account when determining fair value.
Fair value for cash settled share based payments being only those that relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated by use of a simulation model.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the estimated fair value of the award and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the balance sheet date.
Choice of settlement The Company can choose to settle awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently intends to settle all such awards in cash.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are accounted for as cash settled transactions see above.
Dividends Dividends on ordinary shares are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.
Financial instruments The accounting policy of the Company under FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation and FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement for financial instruments is the same as the accounting policy for the Group under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Therefore for details of the Companys accounting policy for financial instruments refer to pages 46 to 48.
The Company has used the exemption within FRS 25 and FRS 26 not to restate comparatives and therefore the previous UK GAAP accounting policies have been used for the 2005 comparatives.
For details of the previous accounting policies for derivative financial instruments refer to page 48.
Investment in own shares In accordance with UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, own shares held by the Groups Employee Benefit Scheme and Qualifying Employee Share Trust have been classified as deductions from shareholders funds.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Company accounts for pensions and similar benefits under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits and measures its obligations due at discounted present value.

The redeemable B shares were redeemable at their nominal value of 18 pence per share at the option of holders on 31 March and 30 September each year.
As a result of the number of B shares already redeemed, the Company was able to compulsorily redeem all the outstanding B shares on 30 September 2005.
The B shares were not listed on a recognised Stock Exchange.
In accordance with UITF 38, all shares held by employee trusts are deducted from shareholders funds and are not classified as assets.
The Company operates two Employee Share Ownership Trusts: the Stagecoach Group Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST and the Stagecoach Group Employee Benefit Trust 2003 EBT.
Shares held by these trusts are treated as a deduction from shareholders funds in the financial statements.

Note 11 Share based payment For details of share based payment awards and fair values see note 29 to the Group financial statements on pages 81 and 82.
The Company accounts for the share based payment charge for the year of 2.2m 2005: 1.3m by recording an increase to its investment in subsidiaries for this amount and recording a corresponding entry to the profit and loss account reserve to reflect the fact that the Company has no employees and all awards of share options in the Companys shares are to employees of subsidiary companies.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 101 Notes to the financial statements Note 12 Guarantees, other financial commitment & contingent liabilities a The Company is party to bank guarantees in respect of guarantees, loans, overdrafts and other facilities provided to certain Group undertakings of which 64.0m was outstanding at 30 April 2006 2005: 81.4m and provides cross-guarantees to certain subsidiary undertakings under VAT group provisions.

Details of related party disclosures provided by the Group can be found on page 87.
Note 14 Prior year adjustment The Company policy for accounting for share based payments and dividends was changed during the year to comply with FRS 20, Share based payments and FRS 21, Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
The comparative figures in the primary statements and notes have been restated to reflect the new policies.
FRS 20 requires the fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees to be recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account.
Previous UK GAAP treatment required the instrinsic value to be recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account.
FRS 21 requires that dividends declared to equity shareholders after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
This differs from the previous UK GAAP treatment which required dividends declared after the balance sheet date to be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
The effect of the changes for each of these is summarised below: 2006 2005 FRS 20, Share based payments Balance sheet m m Increase in investments in subsidiaries 2.1 1.3 Increase in net assets 2.1 1.3 Increase in profit and loss account reserve 2.1 1.3 FRS 21, Events after the Balance Sheet Date Profit and loss account Decrease in dividends recorded in the profit and loss account 4.0 24.4 Increase in profit for the financial year 4.0 24.4 Balance sheet Decrease in dividend payable creditor 4.0 24.4 Increase in net assets 4.0 24.4 Increase in profit and loss account reserve 4.0 24.4 The adoption of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, and FRS 23, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates have had no impact on overall reported results.
On the adoption of FRS 17, deferred taxation in respect of pension liabilities for the comparative year has been reclassified from deferred tax asset within current assets to the pension liability, net of deferred taxation line on the face of the balance sheet.
The adoption of FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Measurement, which requires all derivatives to be fair valued in the balance sheet has also had no net impact on reported results due to the Company having external derivatives matched by equal and opposite internal derivatives.
