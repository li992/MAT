Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation London Merchant Securities plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in its jointly controlled entity.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 83 to 86.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, investment property, assets under construction, owner occupied property and Investment Division investments.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses, in particular in relation to valuation of investment property, valuation of investments and pension scheme actuarial assumptions.
Although management considers that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Transition to Adopted IFRSs The Group is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRS for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1.
An explanation of how the transition to Adopted IFRSs has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group is provided in note 32.
IFRS 1 contains certain optional exemptions to assist in the transition to IFRS.
The Group has elected to use the exemptions as follows: IFRS 2 Share-based payments Under the transitional arrangements within IFRS 2, the requirements of this standard have only been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002.
IFRS 3 Business combinations Under IFRS 1, the Group has taken advantage of the optional exemption not to apply the requirements of IFRS 3 to business combinations prior to the date of transition and to account for these business combinations based on the carrying value at the date of transition of the assets and liabilities at that date.
Any goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries has also been calculated on the basis of its fair value at 1 April 2004.
IAS 19 Employee benefits Under IFRS 1, the Group has elected to recognise the actuarial gains and losses in full at the date of transition, with initial recognition of the defined benefit pension scheme deficit at 1 April 2004 taken through reserves.
The Group has applied the amended requirements of IAS 19 with effect from 1 April 2004, with any subsequent actuarial gains or losses recognised in full in the period they are incurred via the statement of recognised income and expense.
IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates Under IFRS 1, the Group has deemed cumulative translation differences relating to foreign operations as zero at the date of transition.
The Group has elected to adopt IAS 32 Financial Instruments disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments recognition and measurement from the date of transition and has not taken advantage of the exemption to adopt these standards from 1April 2005. b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated interim accounts from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Application of the IFRS definition of a subsidiary to the LMS Group results in two distinct types of entity being classified as subsidiary undertakings.
First, are those entities in both the Property Division and the Investment Division, through which LMS undertakes its business activities of owning, managing and developing properties and making and managing investments.
Second, as part of its Investment Division activities, the Group makes investments in portfolio companies which in some cases, by virtue of the size of the shareholding or other control rights may result in those portfolio investments falling within the definition of subsidiaries.
These portfolio investment companies are consolidated, although they continue to be managed by the Group as portfolio investments held for capital appreciation.
The consolidated results of these entities are shown as separate business segments.
48 London Merchant Securities plc 1 Accounting policies continued ii Joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated interim accounts include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
c Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that reflects the way the Group manages its business, and which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Group has identified five segments for financial reporting purposes.
Property comprising the results and assets employed in the Groups business of owning, managing and developing properties.
Investment management comprising the results and assets employed in the Groups business of making and managing investments for capital appreciation in portfolio companies and funds.
Energy Cranes International Limited as explained above, the Group is required to consolidate certain of its portfolio companies.
These investments continue to be managed by the Group as part of its portfolio held for capital appreciation.
This segment comprises the consolidated results and assets of Energy Cranes International Limited, which manufactures cranes and provides crane-related services to the offshore energy industry, and by virtue of its size constitutes a separate business segment.
Consolidated LMS investments the consolidated results and assets of all other LMS managed portfolio companies that are held and managed as investments but required to be consolidated, are grouped together as one business segment.
Inflexion the consolidated results and assets employed by Inflexion plc and its subsidiaries, including portfolio companies managed as investments by Inflexion plc but required to be consolidated.
d Goodwill and impairment All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost at 1 April 2004, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews or more regularly where indication of impairment exists.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and therefore is not amortised but stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of goodwill or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 1 April 2004, the date of transition of IFRSs, even though no indication of impairment existed.
e Property assets i Investment property Investment properties are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Leasehold properties are classified and accounted for as investment property where the Group holds the property to earn rental income, capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are stated at fair value.
An external, independent valuer, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued, values the portfolio every six months.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
Additional disclosure on the basis of the fair value is included in the investment property note to the balance sheet.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Rental income from investment property is accounted for as described in the accounting policy Revenue.
ii Investment property under development Existing investment properties which are being redeveloped for continued future investment use are measured at fair value and remain classified as investment property.
London Merchant Securities plc 49 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued iii Assets under construction Property assets acquired with the intention of subsequent development as investment property are included as assets under construction within property, plant and equipment, until the construction or development is complete, at which time they are reclassified as investment property.
Assets under construction are included in the balance sheet at fair value, determined by an independent valuer on the same basis as used for investment properties.
Changes in fair value of assets under construction are accounted for as set out in the accounting policy Property, plant and equipment.
iv Owner occupied property Property occupied by the Group for its own purposes is included in property, plant and equipment and stated at fair value.
Changes in fair value are accounted for as set out in the accounting policy Property, plant and equipment.
v Trading property Properties included in inventory are those which were acquired exclusively with a view to resale or development and resale.
Property in inventory is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
vi Expenditure prior to the commencement of a development Expenditure incurred in connection with developments, including the cost of obtaining the necessary planning consents, prior to the commencement of the development, are capitalised as part of the cost of the development where it is probable that the costs will be recovered via a resulting increase in value of the development property.
Where it is not probable that the costs will add value to the property or the scheme is aborted, the costs are written off to the income statement.
Early stage costs incurred prior to the preparation of submission of a planning application, including costs in relation to evaluation of development options and establishing the feasibility of proposed schemes, are written off to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
f Property, plant and equipment i Assets Property, plant and equipment includes: Owned property occupied by the Group.
Equipment, principally office and IT equipment, used by the Group.
Assets under construction for future investment use.
Assets under construction and owned property occupied by the Group are stated at fair value.
Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
ii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each item of property, plant and equipment.
Land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: buildings 30 years plant and equipment 35 years The residual value is reassessed annually.
iii Treatment of gains and losses arising on revaluation of property, plant and equipment If the carrying amount of an asset is increased as a result of revaluation, the increase is credited directly to the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset which previously had been charged to the income statement.
If the carrying amount of the asset is decreased as a result of the revaluation, the decrease is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it reverses previous revaluation increases on the same asset which have been credited to the revaluation reserve, in which case it is charged against the revaluation reserve.
50 London Merchant Securities plc 1 Accounting policies continued g Investment Division investments Investments are included in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value taken through the income statement.
Fair values have been determined by the directors in accordance with industry guidelines.
These guidelines require the valuer to make judgements as to the most appropriate valuation method to be used and the results of the valuations.
Each investment is reviewed individually with regards to the stage, nature and circumstances of the investment and the most appropriate valuation method selected.
Investments are reviewed and revalued every six months.
Those investments that would otherwise be associated undertakings are treated in the same way as all other investments in accordance with the requirements for venture capital companies set out in IAS 28 Investments in Associates.
i Quoted investments Quoted investments for which an active market exists are valued at the closing bid price on the balance sheet date.
Quoted investments which are subject to contractual restrictions on when they may be sold, are valued at the closing bid price on the balance sheet date, discounted in accordance with industry guidelines as appropriate.
ii Unquoted direct investments Unquoted direct investments for which there is no ready market are valued using the most appropriate valuation technique with regard to the stage and nature of the investment.
Valuation methods that may be used include: Recent investments are valued based on the cost of the investment.
Investments in which there has been a recent funding round involving significant financing from new investors are valued at the price of the recent funding, discounted if a new investor is motivated by strategic considerations.
Investments in an established business which is generating sustainable profits and positive cash flows are valued using earnings multiples.
Investments in a business whose value is derived mainly from its underlying net assets rather than its earnings are valued on the basis of net asset valuation.
Investments in an established business which is generating sustainable profits and positive cash flows but for which other valuation methods are not appropriate are valued by calculating the discounted cash flow of future cash flows or earnings.
Investments in a business which is not generating sustainable profits or positive cash flows and for which there has not been any recent independent funding are valued by calculating the estimated discounted cash flow of the investment to the investors.
This valuation basis will primarily be used to determine whether there is any impairment to the carrying value of the asset and, due to the subjective nature of the calculation and the dependence on the outcome of unknown future events, will only give rise to a valuation increase in exceptional circumstances and where there is also additional significant evidence of an increase in value, such as additional funding or profit generation.
iii Funds The General Partners of the funds are, in most cases, providing periodical valuations on a fair value basis.
The Group adopts the General Partner valuation provided it is satisfied that the valuation methods used by the funds are not materially different from the Group valuation methods.
h Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out method and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes a share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
London Merchant Securities plc 51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued j Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the relevant period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to translation reserve.
They are recycled and recognised in profit or loss upon disposal of the operation.
k Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequently, the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting in which case any gain or loss is taken to equity.
Any gain or loss arising on measurement to fair value of ineffective hedges is recognised in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires, is sold or ceases to qualify as a hedge, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
l Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
m Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period to which they relate.
ii Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRSs, were recognised.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2004 in full in the statement of recognised income and expense.
iii Share-based payment transactions The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
52 London Merchant Securities plc 1 Accounting policies continued n Revenue i Rental income and operating lease incentives Rental income from operating leases of investment property is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Operating lease incentives include rent free periods and other incentives such as contributions towards fitting out costs given to lessees on entering into lease agreements.
In accordance with SIC 15 Operating Lease Incentives, rent receivable in the period from lease commencement to lease end or tenant break option if appropriate, is spread evenly over the term of the lease.
The cost of other incentives is spread evenly over the term of the lease.
ii Goods sold and services rendered Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in profit or loss in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant continuing management involvement with the goods.
o Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established which in the case of quoted securities is the ex-dividend date.
p Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
Where income tax relates to items recognised directly in equity the tax charge or credit is also recognised directly in equity.
All other tax is recognised in the income statement.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, other than in business combinations.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax on the revaluation of properties is calculated taking account of the benefit of indexation relief.
The impact of this is disclosed in note 24.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
q Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups operations that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
r Financial guarantees The Group has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 April 2006.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 April 2006.
2005: three subsidiaries were acquired, Healthcare Knowledge International, Ilchester Holdings Limited and Harrington Brooks.
In the period since acquisition the subsidiary contributed net loss of 0.8 million to the consolidated net profit for the year 2005: three subsidiaries contributed net profit of 1.7 million.
The book value and fair value of the assets acquired in the subsidiaries is shown below: Book value Fair value Book value Fair value at acquisition adjustments Fair value at acquisition adjustments Fair value 2006 2006 2006 2005 2005 2005 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net assets acquired Property, plant and equipment 1,811 1,811 1,997 1,997 Inventories 874 874 741 741 Trade and other receivables 9,659 9,659 5,197 5,197 Cash and cash equivalents 836 836 3,936 3,936 Trade and other payables 13,040 13,040 9,093 9,093 Tax liabilities 661 661 Borrowings 12,522 12,522 19,306 19,306 Net identifiable liabilities 12,382 17,189 Share of liabilities acquired 3,071 7,635 Goodwill arising on acquisition 10,071 19,979 Cost of acquisition 7,000 12,344 Consideration paid 7,000 12,344 Cash acquired 836 3,936 Net cash outflow 6,164 8,408 Disposal by Inflexion plc of its business On 16 March 2006 Inflexion plc, the Groups 58.8% owned subsidiary, disposed of its business assets for cash.

8 Pension costs The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group companies.
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Managed Fund Policy with Sun Alliance and London Insurance Company Limited plus annuity policies held in the name of the Trustees.
With effect from 6 April 2001 the Company introduced a plan to pay contributions to personal pensions established with a specific provider.
New employees are eligible to join this arrangement: the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants.
Inflexion plc, the Groups 58.8% owned subsidiary, pays contributions to personal pensions for its employees.
The pension charge for the Group was 1.2 million, including 0.6 million relating to the LMS defined benefit scheme, 0.1 million relating to the LMS defined contribution scheme and 0.5 million relating to defined contribution pension schemes operated by companies in the consolidated investment portfolio companies 2005: 1.2 million, 0.1 million and 0.4 million respectively.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The most important assumptions made in connection with the establishment of this charge were that interest will be earned on the fund at the rate of 5% per annum and that salaries will be increased at 4.6% per annum.
The market value of assets of the scheme at 31 March 2006 was 19.0 million and the actuarial value of those assets on an ongoing basis represented 109.8% of the benefit of 17.3 million that had accrued to members allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Net of the related deferred tax liability the pension surplus is 1.2 million.

However, the Group is under no obligation to redeem borrowings until maturity at which time they are repayable at their nominal value.
Financial instruments Exposure to interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate risk Hedging The Groups principal floating rate exposure is on the Revolving Bank Loan 2013, and in respect of this loan it is the Groups policy that a substantial proportion of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate basis.
London Merchant Securities plc 73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Financial Instruments continued Interest rate swaps have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure within the Groups policy.
The swaps mature over the next seven years following the maturity of the related loans and have fixed swap rates of approximately 4.8%.
At 31 March 2006 the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 140 million 2005: nil, all of which were deemed to be effective hedges.
The fair value adjustment arising in relation to these swaps at 31 March 2006 was 0.6 million liability, which was taken directly to reserves.
Effective interest rates and repricing In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.
The impact of this is to reduce the liability by 77.6 million at 31 March 2006 2005: 67.3 million.

Options to subscribe for shares under the Companys share option scheme are listed in the table below which shows both the adjusted price and the previous price.
Performance conditions exist for options granted under the LMS Executive Share Option Scheme.
These are explained in the tables below.
The Trustee of the QUEST is LMS QUEST Trustee Limited, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
All employees of the Company, including executive directors of the Company except The Hon R A Rayne, are potential beneficiaries under the QUEST.
At 31 March 2006, the QUEST held 117,778 Ordinary shares at a cost and valuation of 0.1 million 2005: 270,689 Ordinary shares at a cost and valuation of 0.2 million.
Vesting is after a performance condition has been satisfied.
The performance condition for the executive options granted in July 2000 and January 2001 is that in any three year period following the grant of the options Shareholders funds must increase by a percentage greater than the increase in the Retail Prices Index plus 9%.
The performance condition for the executive options granted in April 2003 and August 2003 is that in the first three year period following the grant of the options Shareholders funds must increase by a percentage greater than the increase in the Retail Prices Index plus 9%.
The performance condition for the executive options granted after September 2004 is that the Total Shareholder Return TSR over the first three year period after grant must exceed the arithmetic average of the TSR for the FTSE 250 and the TSR for the FTSE Real Estate index for the same period.
Under the Scheme employees make regular payments into a savings account which, after a predetermined period of three, five or seven years, can be used to purchase shares at a price set at the start of the savings period.
The first exercise date shown in the table above is in each case three years from the date of grant.
Under the rules of the LMS Executive Share Option Scheme and the LMS Sharesave Scheme, if the Company enters into a Scheme of Arrangement options may be exercisable earlier than three years from the date of grant.
Pursuant to the demerger of Leo Capital plc a Scheme of Arrangement was sanctioned by the Court on 8 June 2006 and the Remuneration Committee treated the performance conditions for grants under the Executive Share Option Scheme as satisfied.

London Merchant Securities plc 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29 Contingent liabilities Guarantees have been given in respect of warranties on the sale of certain subsidiaries and other liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
30 Related party transactions Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed.
31 Subsequent events On 12 April 2006 the Company announced details of the proposed demerger of its Investment business.
The demerger proposals were approved by Shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 17 May 2006 and the capital reconstruction was sanctioned by the Court and the demerger became effective on 9 June 2006.
The effect of the demerger on the continuing LMS plc Group is to leave it with its Property Division assets.
32 Explanation of transition to Adopted IFRS As stated in note 1, these are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 the Groups date of IFRS transition.
In preparing the opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to Adopted IFRS has affected the Groups financial performance, financial position and cash flows is set out in the reconciliations and accompanying notes below.
Reconciliation of loss after tax: Year ended 31 March 2005 Notes 000 Previously reported UK GAAP: Loss on ordinary activities after taxation before minority interests 5,829 Adjustments: Change in amortisation period for lease incentives a 172 Revaluation gains on investment properties previously Classified as trading properties b 6,953 Depreciation of owner-occupied property c 105 Movement in gains on disposal of investments includes fair value uplift in period and adjustments where part of profit recognised in previous periods d 2,079 Revaluation gains on investment properties in the period e 61,300 Current period impact of transfer of SIC 15 balance e 1,726 Write-back of negative goodwill taken in previous periods f 392 Current period charge net of tax arising on grant of share options g 138 Defined benefit pension scheme net movement in liability h 467 Net increase in deferred tax liability i 13,685 Net impact of consolidation of Inflexion j 7,376 Net impact of consolidation of subsidiaries previously classified as investments k 5,575 52,568 Restated IFRS: Profit for the period after tax 46,739 80 London Merchant Securities plc 32 Explanation of transition to Adopted IFRSs continued Reconciliation of net assets: 31 March 1 April 2005 2004 Notes 000 000 Previously reported UK GAAP: Net assets 787,992 757,973 Adjustments: Impact of revaluation of former trading properties b 25,786 18,833 Reversal of proposed dividends liability l 14,838 10,742 Impact of revaluation of investments to fair value d 7,778 9,857 Write-off of negative goodwill f 392 Net impact of defined benefit pension liability h 5,786 6,372 Net deferred tax liability i 46,817 34,293 Reversal of proposed dividends liability to minority m 1,247 Net impact of consolidation of Inflexion j 6,003 2,884 Net impact of consolidation of subsidiaries previously classified as investments k 688 1,644 9,645 399 Restated IFRS: Net assets 778,347 758,372 a Lease incentives Under IFRS, rent free periods and other incentives, are amortised over the period to the first break option, or the full lease term, rather than the period to first open market rent review as under UK GAAP.
At the date of transition the cumulative effect of incentives granted prior to that date has been adjusted for via retained earnings.
b Trading property inventory property previously shown as trading property under UK GAAP but which does not fall under the definition of trading property inventory under IFRS has been reclassified as investment property, is held at fair value and gains and losses arising on revaluations are now recognised directly in the income statement.
Any gains or losses on disposal of property previously classified as trading property which has been disposed of since the date of transition have also been adjusted to reflect the impact of revaluation to fair value in the opening balance sheet.
c Owner-occupied property previously held as investment property at valuation, under IFRS the Groups offices have been reclassified as owner-occupied property within property, plant and equipment and are being depreciated over their useful economic life.
The property will continue to be held at fair value with gains arising on revaluation taken via the revaluation reserve.
Revaluation gains or losses are calculated after adjusting the cost of the asset for the accumulated depreciation.
d Investments under IFRS, investments are held at fair value, as against cost less impairment under UK GAAP.
Therefore, at the date of transition investments have been restated at fair value, with the resulting gain or loss on revaluation compared to the UK GAAP carrying amount recognised in retained earnings.
Gains and losses arising on revaluations of investments since the date of transition are recognised directly in the income statement.
Any gains or losses on disposal of investments disposed of since the date of transition have also been adjusted to reflect the impact of revaluation to fair value in the opening balance sheet.
e Investment properties under IFRS, gains and losses arising on revaluation of investment properties are recognised directly in the income statement.
Accumulated revaluation gains and losses including SIC 15 balances within the revaluation reserve at the date of transition have been transferred to retained earnings.
The value of investment properties at each period end has been increased by the present value of ground rents payable on leasehold properties, with an equivalent liability also recognised.
f Negative goodwill under IFRS, negative goodwill is not permitted and must be written back to the income statement.
Therefore, an adjustment has been made to eliminate the negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of Inflexion plc held on the balance sheet under UK GAAP at the date of transition.
Under UK GAAP this negative goodwill was written-off in the year ended 31 March 2005, therefore an adjustment has also been made to reverse this credit in the income statement.
g Share-based payments under IFRS, the cost of granting share options is required to be recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.
Under the transitional provisions, the cost has only been calculated for options granted after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
The resulting cost has been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement and credited to retained earnings.
London Merchant Securities plc 81 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Explanation of transition to Adopted IFRSs continued h Pension obligations under IFRS, the Group is required to account for the net liability or asset in respect of defined benefit pension schemes on the balance sheet.
Under the transitional provisions, the liability recognised at the date of transition includes the cumulative actuarial losses to the date of transition.
Actuarial gains or losses arising from the date of transition are recognised in full in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
A corresponding deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the deferred tax benefit associated with the net pension liability recognised on the balance sheet.
i Deferred tax under IFRS, deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences and requires provision to be made for the deferred tax liability associated with the revaluation of investment properties and investments.
Under UK GAAP the potential liability on the sale of the properties and investments is disclosed as contingent tax but not provided on the balance sheet unless the liability is expected to crystallise.
This liability would only be incurred were the property assets and investments to be sold.
A deferred tax asset has also been recognised in respect of the tax benefit associated with the established tax losses and the potential asset on sale of some of the investments at the revalued amount, but this has been offset against deferred tax liabilities, where such netting is permitted, and the net deferred tax liability is shown on the balance sheet.
j Inflexion consolidation of investment Fund II under IFRS, as the General Partner and also a Limited Partner of Fund II, Inflexion plc is deemed to have the power to control Inflexion Fund II and is therefore required to consolidate the Fund into its financial statements as a subsidiary at the date of transition.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups consolidated financial statements include both Inflexion plcs and the Groups Limited Partner investments in Fund II at cost less provision for impairment.
In the period to 31 March 2005, one investment within Inflexion Fund II meets the definition of a subsidiary under IFRS and so has been consolidated into Fund II, which has in turn been consolidated into Inflexion plc.
As a result of direct investments held by Inflexion plc in entities in which Fund II also has an interest, Inflexion plc is deemed to have the power to control an additional two investments, which have therefore also been consolidated.
k Consolidation of subsidiaries previously held as investments under IFRS, there are a number of investments that meet the IFRS definition of a subsidiary, which were held as investments under UK GAAP.
At the date of transition eight such investments have been consolidated as subsidiaries of the Group.
At 31 March 2005 only four such investments have been consolidated as subsidiaries of the Group, as a result of four investments being restructured during the year.
l Proposed dividends under IFRS, proposed dividends are not recognised as liabilities until they have been approved and there is an obligation to make the payment.
Therefore the balance sheet, both at the date of transition and at 31 March 2005, has been adjusted to recognise the dividends when approved.
This results in an increase in equity shareholders funds under IFRS compared to UK GAAP and also a net decrease in the dividend for the period.
Under IFRS, the dividend is not reflected as part of the income statement but is shown in the Reconciliation of Movement in Equity.
m Proposed dividends liability to minority as noted above, under IFRS proposed dividends are not recognised as liabilities until there is an obligation to make the payment.
Therefore dividends payable to minority interests have been reclassified as equity minority interests.
n Other: Accounting for joint ventures joint ventures, which were gross equity accounted for under UK GAAP, have been equity accounted for under IFRS.
The main difference under IFRS is that the share of profit after tax is shown on the face of the income statement, compared to the share of turnover and share of operating profit required to be disclosed on the face of the profit and loss account under UK GAAP.
Other: Property, plant and equipment assets under construction under IFRS, properties or land acquired with an intention of development as investment property are classified as assets under construction within property, plant and equipment.
At the date of transition one development property, Greenwich Reach, has been reclassified within assets under construction.
The property will continue to be valued at fair value with gains arising on revaluation taken via the revaluation reserve.
Other: Cash flows Under IFRS, the consolidated cash flow statement requires reconciliation of the movements in cash and cash equivalents, compared to UK GAAP, under which the movements in cash only have been reconciled.
The IFRS consolidated cash flow statement includes the cash flows of the investments, as described above, which under IFRS meet the definition of a subsidiary but which were held as investments under UK GAAP.
Any corresponding adjustments to investment cash flows are also reflected.
