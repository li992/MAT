Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 1 Segmental reporting by business group The tables below show segmental information by business segment.
Business segments are primary segments and represent the way in which the business is managed.
Each segment underwrites sub-classes of business which fall within the broad classes of aviation, marine, non-marine and UK commercial business.
The segments are discussed in more detail in the operating and financial review.
The non-marine business group is large and comprises direct and reinsurance books of business.
The segmental disclosure excludes insurance premium, income and claims expenses from the receipt of reinsurance to close as detailed in note 2 as these have no impact on profit for the year.
