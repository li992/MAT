Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs.
For the IT services business segment, CGUs represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
For the Telecoms Products business segment, CGUs represent a product area.
The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date by business segment and, for the IT services business segment, by geographic area: Restated 2006 2005 m m IT services United Kingdom 167.6 167.6 Nordics 686.9 France 456.5 10.2 Netherlands 14.7 14.9 Germany 95.3 59.8 International 99.1 100.9 1,520.1 353.4 Telecoms Products 32.0 32.0 1,552.1 385.4 The comparative information in the tables above has been amended so that the new International category includes the previously reported Iberia, Rest of Europe and Rest of World categories.
The group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
At 31 December 2006, the recoverable amounts of CGUs were determined from value in use calculations, except for the Nordics category.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash ows.
For the Nordics, the fair value less costs to sell valuation method was used to determine if any impairment occurred as at 31 December 2006.
The fair value less costs to sell valuation approach has been used for the Nordics as the entire goodwill for this category pertains to the acquisition of WM-data.
The purchase price paid is considered to equal the fair value of the CGUs within the Nordics category.
In all cases, except for the Nordics, the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash ow projections for a CGU.
The cash ow projections in the four financial years following the budget year re ected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that re ects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks speci c to the CGU.
The discount rates applied to the most signi cant CGUs in the IT services business were as follows: 2006 2005 % % United Kingdom 13.4 12.7 France 12.6 11.6 Weighted average discount rate applied to CGUs in the United Kingdom IT services business.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operations is primarily based on past performance.
The long-term operating margin refers to the margin on adjusted operating pro t as described in note 9.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs were in the range of 5.0% 2005: 5.0% to 10.0% 2005: 10.0%.
