ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and the AITC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts dated January 2003 and revised in December 2005.
Prior year adjustments, as shown in note 20 on page 43, have arisen due to the change in the accounting treatment of proposed dividends as explained in paragraph i. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue account on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an effective yield basis.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term loans and deposits are dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue account within the Income Statement with the exception of the investment management fee and debenture interest.
Expenses are charged to capital where they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments.
In this respect the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital in line with the Boards expectation of returns from the Companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively.
Since April 2000, the Company has allocated 70% of management fee and debenture interest to capital and 30% to revenue costs.
In accordance with the SORP the Board has reviewed this policy and, having examined consensus forecasts of capital return and dividend payments, sees no need to change the existing policy at this time.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves - realised and unrealised.
g Valuation of investments In accordance with FRS26 investments are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Listed investments are valued at bid market price.
However, no adjustments have been made to the prior periods results as the Company has taken advantage of paragraph 108D of the Standard and disclosed the effect of valuing investments at bid price as shown in note 9 on page 35.
Unlisted investments are valued at bid market prices ruling where an organised market in such investments exists: other unquoted investments are included at Directors estimate of fair value.
Where a price is not readily available the holding would be valued at cost unless circumstances indicate a different valuation is warranted.
In general, valuations are increased where a substantial arms length transaction has occurred subsequent to acquisition, at a price higher than cost.
Valuations are decreased where subsequent transactions have taken place at a price lower than cost or where Fidelitys Fair Value Committee is aware that the investment is experiencing operating difficulties.
The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2006 Page 31 Notes to the Financial Statements h Capital reserve - realised Gains and losses on the realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - realised.
The capital element of the investment management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is credited to this reserve.
Capital reserve - unrealised Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - unrealised.
i Dividends In accordance with FRS21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date.
Prior year results have been restated accordingly and this is shown in note 20 on page 43. j Presentation The revised SORP and changes to UK GAAP have given rise to the following changes in the presentation of the financial statements: i the Statement of Total Return is now called the Income Statement and the total column, as opposed to the revenue column, is now the profit and loss account of the Company.
ii a new primary statement, the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds, has been introduced.
Dividends paid and shares repurchased by the Company are now reported through this statement.

The fee is subject to VAT at the appropriate rate.

TAX ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES a Analysis of charge in year Overseas taxation 30 40 Total current tax for year see note 6b 30 40 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2006 Page 33 Notes to the Financial Statements b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The taxation assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for an investment trust company of 30% 2005: 30%.
The differences are explained below.
2006 2005 000 000 Revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation 36,348 29,700 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2005: 30% 10,904 8,910 Effects of: Income not subject to corporation tax 11,643 9,758 Increase in excess management expenses excess loan relationship debits in the revenue account 739 848 Overseas taxation 30 40 Current corporation tax charge note 6a 30 40 Investment trust companies are exempt from tax on capital gains if they meet the Inland Revenue criteria set out in s842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for a given period.
Therefore, any capital return is not included in the above reconciliation.
c Deferred taxation At 31 March 2006, the Company had net surplus management expenses and net surplus losses on loan relationships being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable totalling 188,813,724 2005: 170,133,447 and eligible unrelieved foreign taxation totalling 73,550 2005: 49,792.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.
DIVIDENDS Interim dividend of 4.40 pence per share paid for the year ended 31 March 2006 2005: 4.20 pence 10,426 10,057 Final dividend of 8.95 pence per share paid for the year ended 31 March 2005 2004: 8.95 pence 21,363 21,730 31,789 31,787 The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 10.85 pence per share, amounting in total to 25,383,219, which is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The total dividend payable in respect of the year ended 31 March 2006, which is the basis on which the requirements of Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are considered, is stated below: 2006 2005 '000 '000 Interim dividend of 4.40 pence per share paid for the year ended 31 March 2006 2005: 4.20 pence 10,426 10,057 Proposed final dividend of 10.85 pence per share for the year ended 31 March 2006 2005: 8.95 pence 25,383 21,363 35,809 31,420 Page 34 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Financial Statements 2006 2005 revenue capital total revenue capital total 8.
RETURN PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic 15.28p 96.80p 112.08p 12.36p 45.65p 58.01p Returns per ordinary share are based on the net revenue return on ordinary activities after taxation of 36,318,000 2005: 29,660,000 and the capital return in the year of 230,105,000 2005: 109,592,000 and on 237,710,961 ordinary shares 2005: 240,061,646 being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE Total shareholders funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 26.
The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the Articles of Association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.
A reconciliation between the two sets of figures follows:- 2006 2005 Total shareholders funds: as restated 1,214,604,000 1,003,133,000 Less: Debenture stock discount 61,000 65,000 Debenture stock issue expense 4,085,000 4,332,000 Adjusted net assets 1,210,458,000 998,736,000 Number of equity shares in issue at year end 233,946,714 239,446,714 Total shareholders funds per share pence 519.18 418.94 Less: Unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses pence 1.77 1.84 Adjusted net asset value per share pence 517.41 417.10 Page 38 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Financial Statements 2006 2005 restated 000 000 The movements during the year of the assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows:- Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2005 998,736 900,723 Effect of changing prices from middle market to bid market at 1 April 2005 1,405 Total recognised capital gain for the year 230,105 109,592 Revenue return for the year 36,318 29,660 Dividend appropriated in the year 31,789 31,787 Movement in unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 251 251 Repurchase of ordinary shares 21,758 9,703 Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2006 1,210,458 998,736 The net asset value adjusted to include the debenture stocks at market value rather than at par is 486.20p 2005: 391.97p.

The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Futures and covered call options held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Debenture stocks It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Short term debtors and other short term creditors are excluded from the following analyses.
The risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk.
This is regarded as a principal risk and is referred to in the Business Review on page 12.
Market price risk comprises interest rate risk, equity price changes and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
Page 40 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Financial Statements At each Board meeting the Board considers the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
The Company has the option to invest up to 200m of the debenture stocks in the equity market.
In a rising market the Company would benefit, but in a falling market the impact would be severe.
In order to manage the level of gearing, the Manager invests part of the assets available in Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc and short term cash deposits.
This controls the level of net gearing.
As mentioned in the Chairmans statement on page 4 at the year end 140m of the debenture stocks was invested in the equity market.
Long futures positions have been used during the year as a quick and effective means to increase the Companys exposure to the equity market.
Due to the movement of markets in the year transactions in futures have resulted in realised capital gains of 455,000 2005: losses 241,000.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values, with the exception of the long term fixed rate debenture stocks, whose fair value as at 31 March 2006 given below has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the stocks and is set out below.
2006 2005 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 1 11 % debenture stock 2014 143,240 100,000 138,555 100,000 2 3 7 % debenture stock 2022 129,770 100,000 121,624 100,000 4 273,010 200,000 260,179 200,000 Interest rate risk All of the Companys long term debt is fixed rate which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is provided in note 12.
The Companys financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Company also has cash balances invested at short term market interest rates which therefore carry no material risk.
The interest profile of the Companys financial liabilities, excluding short term creditors, as at 31 March 2006 and 2005 was as follows: 2006 2005 weighted weighted average average fixed rate weighted period fixed rate weighted period financial average for which financial average for which liabilities interest rate rate is fixed liabilities interest rate rate is fixed 000 months 000 months Currency UK sterling 200,000 9.625% 148.5 200,000 9.625% 160.5 Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2006 Page 41 Notes to the Financial Statements The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
