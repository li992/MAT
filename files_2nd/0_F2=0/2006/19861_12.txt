ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups accounting policies are set out in detail in note 1 to the financial statements and they should be read to gain a complete understanding of how the Group accounts for particular items.
Particular attention is drawn to the policies on pensions and provisions as these are areas which involve the use of judgement or the making of significant estimates by the directors.
As noted above, the accounting policy for properties has been modied in the year and the 2005 gures restated accordingly.
The change is considered appropriate by the directors in order to give a fairer representation of, and more relevant information on, investment property values.
The directors consider the revised accounting policies to be the most appropriate for the Company and the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes the Group will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, dened as at least the next twelve months.
TREASURY MANAGEMENT The Group holds a number of financial instruments, including cash and liquid resources, borrowings and other items, such as trade creditors and accruals, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
