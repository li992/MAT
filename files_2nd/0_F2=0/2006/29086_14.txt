It is open to new entrants and has 357 active members in the defined benefits section and 776 members in the defined contribution section at 31 December 2006 2005: 419 and 668 respectively.
The most recent triennial valuation of the UK Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2003 and disclosed that the market value of the assets of the UK Scheme represented 88 per cent.
of the liability for the benefits that had accrued to members at that date allowing for future increases in earnings and pensions.
The valuation of the UK Scheme as at 1 January 2006 is being considered and will be formalised by the Trustee and the Company by 31 March 2007.
The Company paid contributions in 2006 of 30.8 per cent.
For joiners on or after 1 June 1989, pensionable salaries for this purpose were subject to the statutory earnings cap which was in force until April 2006, after which this cap was replaced by a notional earnings cap.
The Companys contributions will be reviewed following the formal valuation of the UK Scheme as at 1 January 2006.
The pension cost under IAS 19 for the defined benefits section of the UK Scheme has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited, and is based on valuations of the UK Scheme as at 1 January 2006.
This valuation was carried out using the projected unit method and the principal financial assumptions set out on page 59.
Assets were taken at bid value and are held separately from the Companys assets.
Over the year, the contributions to the defined benefits section of the UK Scheme totalled 8.4 million 2005: 40.6 million.
In April 2005, the Company made a one-off cash contribution into the Scheme of 30.3 million to extinguish the deficit at 31 December 2004 as calculated under FRS 17.
The balance sheet asset at 31 December 2006 was 16.8 million 2005: 8.8 million.
The Group operates a number of smaller pension schemes around the world, some of which are funded defined benefit schemes with valuations performed regularly by qualified actuaries and with actuarial assumptions which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the funds are situated.
In addition, there are several defined contribution schemes.
The additional disclosures required by IAS 19 are set out below.
Figures shown are for the defined benefits section of the UK Scheme only.

The review resulted in a new investment strategy which reduced risk whilst still generating an expected return in excess of the expected cost of meeting the Schemes benefit payments.
This was achieved by March 2006 by putting 35 per cent.
of the Schemes assets into liability driven investments including bonds and derivatives, such as interest rate and inflation swaps, and cash so as to match the profile of the Schemes liabilities.

Its results included in these accounts are shown below, together with the Groups percentage interest therein at 31 December 2006.
It is incorporated and operates in Guernsey.
Particulars of issued share and loan capital of the principal associate at 31 December 2006 are: Percentage owned by the Class Number Issued capital Group Guernsey Schroder Ventures Investments Limited Ordinary shares 446,200 4,462 50 Deferred shares 107,200 1,072 50 Redeemable preference shares 4,462,000 4,462 50 B redeemable preference shares 610,179 610,179 C redeemable preference shares 2,187,138 1,474 Senior debt, 2007 18,431,273 The financial statements of SVIL are prepared to 30 June each year.
Accounts are prepared to this date so that the companys year end is coterminous with those of its major investments.
For the purposes of applying the equity method of accounting, the interim financial statements of SVIL have been used.
When equity accounting for the investment in SVIL, the Group does not recognise its share of the unrealised gains or losses arising on SVILs own investments, except to the extent that such unrealised reserves fall below zero.
The Groups share of SVILs profit for 2006 therefore does not equate to SVILs profit for the year multiplied by the Groups percentage ownership.

Assets backing insurance unit-linked liabilities and insurance unit-linked liabilities During the year, the Group established a wholly-owned life company to invest in open-ended authorised unit trusts on behalf of clients seeking to invest in unit trusts with a life assurance wrapper.
The Group has negligible exposure to credit risk in relation to the investments of the life company as the risks and rewards associated with its investments are borne by the investors in the life companys funds and not by the life company itself.
Reconciliation of investments in authorised unit trusts to liability linked to life company investments: 2006 2005 mn mn Investments in authorised unit trusts 1,307.4 1 Other financial assets 211.7 1 Cash and cash equivalents 12.9 Liability linked to life company investments 1,532.0 1 Represents the assets of the Schroders Diversified Growth Fund in which the life company is the sole investor.
At the balance sheet date, the weighted average effective interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents was 5.2 per cent.
The carrying amounts of the Groups life company investments are unhedged and are denominated in sterling.
It is estimated that 1,455.4 million of the assets backing insurance unit-linked liabilities, together with an equivalent amount of linked liabilities, will be settled after 12 months, with the balance settling within one year.
As is common practice in the industry, the life company has granted floating charges over its long-term insurance assets to its reinsured policy holders.
The floating charges convert into fixed charges in the event of the insolvency of the life company.
The charge ensures that such policy holders rank equally with direct policy holders in the event of the insolvency or winding-up of the life company.

Non-current assets held for sale From time to time, Group companies inject capital into funds operated by the Group seed capital.
Where the Group holds more than 50 per cent.
of the fund in which it is investing and where voting rights are attached to the holding, the Group technically controls the fund and it becomes a subsidiary of the Group.
Where the Group is actively seeking to reduce its holding, the fund is classified as being held for sale as it is considered highly probable that the fund will not remain under the control of the Group one year after the original investment is made.
If the Group still retains control of the fund after this time, the fund ceases to be classified as held for sale and is consolidated.

Non-current assets held for sale continued 2006 2005 mn mn Seed capital classified as being held for sale 60.1 23.4 In the year to 31 December 2006, 13 new investments in funds were classified as non-current assets held for sale.
Nine funds in which the Group held seed capital investments during the year ceased to be classified as non-current assets held for sale as they no longer met the conditions within IFRS 5 regarding such classifications.
Investments cease to be classified as held for sale when they are no longer controlled by the Group.
This may happen either through sale of the investment and or dilution of the Groups holding.
The effect of reclassifying these funds on the results of operations is to decrease revenue by 0.9 million in 2006 2005: 3.1 million.

Holders of the subscriber shares had no right to participate in the profits or assets of the Company and were not entitled to vote at general meetings of the Company, although they were entitled to receive notice of and attend such meetings.
The subscriber shares were cancelled during the year.

Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006 34.
Commitments and contingent liabilities continued f Other The Group has a contractual obligation to reinstate certain leasehold premises before expiry of the lease in 2018.
The Directors believe that this obligation cannot be provided for because it cannot be measured reliably.
Obligations of certain Group companies under the Euroclear settlement system are secured by charges on assets held on their behalf from time to time within that system and by cash deposits placed.
In the ordinary course of business, subsidiary undertakings have custody of customers securities, act as trustees and issue indemnities on behalf of customers who have lost certificates of title.
The Company and subsidiary undertakings have also provided letters of comfort to regulatory authorities and others that subsidiary undertakings will be capitalised adequately and will meet their contractual obligations.
Awards to employees of rights to share-based payments The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements: Share Option Plan 2000 : Under this Plan, the Group grants market value share options over non-voting ordinary shares to executive Directors and other key employees.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years and, for executive Directors, the performance target has been met.
The performance target, in line with market practice, is that the Groups earnings per share growth defined as the earnings per ordinary share before any exceptional items, as derived from the Companys Annual Report and Accounts must be at least four per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over the initial three-year period.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1986 and the Share Option Plan 1999 : Options over non-voting ordinary shares were granted to executive Directors and other key employees.
In line with market practice at the time the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1986 was introduced, the vesting of these awards was not subject to performance conditions.
Under the Share Option Plan 1999 the performance target of all option holders, including executive Directors, was that the Groups earnings per share growth must be at least two per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over a minimum five-year period.
This performance condition was in line with market practice at the time of the award.
The Group no longer grants awards under these former plans.
Equity Compensation Plan 2000 : Under this Plan, executive Directors and other key employees receive deferred bonus awards over ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares, normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nil cost.
These awards are subject to forfeiture and will vest on the third anniversary provided the participant continues to be employed within the Group.
Further details are given in the remuneration report on page 27.
All of the above share-based payment arrangements involve a maximum term of ten years for each option granted and are settled through the transfer of assets of Schroders plc to employees of the Group.
Share Incentive Plan: Under this plan approved by HM Revenue & Customs, eligible employees can purchase ordinary shares in the Group each month up to 1,500 per taxation year from their gross salary.
In April 2006, the Group began to match employee share purchases up to 50 per month.
These matching shares are effectively free shares awarded to the employee subject to their remaining in employment for one year.
Certain employees have been awarded cash-settled equivalents to these share-based awards.
The fair value of these awards is determined using the same methods and models used to value the equivalent equity-settled awards.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date.
Awards to employees of rights to share-based payments continued a Share option plans Movements in the number of options over non-voting ordinary shares outstanding and their relative weighted average exercise prices are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average average exercise price exercise price per share Options per share Options At 1 January 715p 16,318,802 713p 21,614,092 Granted 1085p 36,866 711p 350,133 Forfeited 492p 38,079 624p 1,332,086 Exercised 668p 4,154,782 677p 3,243,818 Lapsed 805p 1,106,414 874p 1,069,519 At 31 December 726p 11,056,393 715p 16,318,802 Outstanding options immediately exercisable 714p 8,833,078 687p 7,225,455 The weighted average share price, at exercise date, of options exercised during the year was 10.78 2005: 8.49.
Awards to employees of rights to share-based payments continued The fair value of options granted during the year, determined using the stochastic valuation model was 0.1 million 2005: 0.6 million and the weighted average fair value was 2.51 2005: 1.81 per option.
The significant inputs into the model were: a weighted average share price of 10.85 2005: 7.11 at the grant date: the exercise price as shown above: volatility of 21.4 per cent.
calculated on the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average basis: option life based on the expected exercise behaviour linked to share price and period since grant assuming options exercisable between years three and ten: dividend yield of 2.0 per cent.
: and annual risk-free interest rate of 4.4 per cent.
2005: 4.8 per cent.. b Equity Compensation Plan Under the Equity Compensation Plan, rights over 3,555,225 ordinary 2005: nil and 40,853 non-voting ordinary 2005: 3,272,442 shares were granted during the year ended 31 December 2006.
The weighted average fair value of 9.99 per ordinary 2005: nil and 9.47 per non-voting ordinary 2005: 6.46 share was calculated using the market value of the shares at the grant date, discounted for dividends foregone over the average holding period of the award.
During 2006, the Group changed the vesting conditions for a small number of employees, not including any executive Director, for certain of its outstanding vested Equity Compensation Plan share awards.
The vesting dates were changed by extending to 6 March 2009.
The fair value of the awards were unchanged.
c Cash-settled share-based awards The Group issues to certain employees cash-settled share-based awards that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the award to the employee on the date of exercise.
At 31 December 2006, the total carrying amount of liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based awards at the balance sheet date was 3.4 million 2005: 3.0 million.
The total intrinsic value at 31 December 2006 of liabilities for which the counterpartys right to cash or other assets had vested by that date was 1.2 million 2005: 1.0 million.
d Share Incentive Plan The employee monthly share purchase plan is open to most UK-based employees and provides free shares from the Group to match the employee purchase up to a maximum of 50 per month.
Pursuant to these plans the Group issued 20,371 ordinary shares in 2006 2005: nil, at a weighted average share price of 9.91 2005: nil.
A charge of 0.2 million 2005: nil will be expensed over a vesting period of one year.
The Group recognised total expenses of 28.6 million 2005: 25.3 million arising from share-based payment transactions during the year of which 27.5 million 2005: 23.3 million were equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Events after the balance sheet date On 14 December 2006, Schroders plc announced that it had reached agreement to acquire interests representing 99.7 per cent.
of the share capital of Aareal Asset Management GmbH and its subsidiaries AAM, a pan-European property asset manager based in Germany.
Regulatory approval for the acquisition was received on 28 February 2007.
Under the terms of the agreement, Schroders paid27.9 million 18.8 million in cash on completion to Aareal Bank AG Aareal, the sole owner of AAM.
Schroders also acquired certain investments at a cost of23.8 million 16.0 million from Aareal in the underlying funds managed by AAM and may acquire further investments managed by AAM for up to29.8 million 20.1 million in the event that they are not sold by Aareal prior to 31 March 2007.
The net tangible assets acquired are approximately6.0 million 4.0 million, although, at the date these financial statements were authorised for issue, completion accounts had not yet been finalised.
Consequently, it is impracticable to disclose further information regarding assets and liabilities acquired or differences between carrying amounts of such items immediately before and after acquisition.
Related party transactions a Transactions between related parties Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

b Key management personnel compensation The remuneration of key management personnel during the year was as follows: 2006 2005 mn mn Short-term employee benefits 12.7 11.8 Post-employment benefits 0.6 0.7 Other long-term benefits 3.3 5.2 Share-based payments 5.7 7.5 22.3 25.2 The remuneration of key management personnel is determined by the Remuneration Committee having regard to the performance of individuals and market rates.
The remuneration policy is described in more detail in the remuneration report on page 26.
Acquisitions On 3 May 2006, the Group acquired 100 per cent.
of the issued share capital of NewFinance Capital Holdings Limited for consideration of 57.4 million.
This transaction has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The net assets acquired in the transaction, and the goodwill arising, are as follows: Book value fair value mn Net assets acquired: Property, plant and equipment 0.3 Non-current asset investments 0.1 Associates 0.1 Cash at bank 6.8 Debtors 1.8 Creditors 5.8 3.3 Goodwill 43.6 Intangible assets 10.5 57.4 Satisfied by: 1 Cash 19.8 Deferred consideration 37.6 Total consideration 57.4 1 Includes acquisition costs of 1.1 million.
Excluding the acquisition of intangible assets of 10.5 million, there were no material differences between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities on acquisition.
The carrying value of the intangible assets immediately prior to acquisition was nil.
Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006 38.
Acquisitions continued Deferred consideration is stated at its fair value at the date of acquisition and consists of a notional 20.6 million investment in funds managed by NewFinance Capital, the award of non-voting ordinary shares in Schroders plc with a value of 15.1 million and deferred cash payments of 1.9 million.
Deferred consideration of 36.5 million is due to be paid in equal amounts at the first, second and third anniversary of the date of completion, subject to certain non-performance related criteria.
The remaining deferred cash balance of 1.1 million is payable within ten working days of agreement between the parties of the audited completion accounts.
The award of deferred shares is classified within equity on the face of the balance sheet as other reserves.
Additional contingent cash consideration of 20.1 million is payable provided certain stringent performance criteria are met.
The Directors consider that the recognition criteria as set out in IFRS 3 have not yet been met and the contingent consideration has therefore not been provided for in these financial accounts.
The Directors will continue to review performance under the terms of the acquisition agreement to determine over time whether such contingent consideration should be recognised for consolidation purposes.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of NewFinance Capital Holdings Limited is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the hedge fund of funds business acquired see note 9.
The intangible assets represent values attributed to fund management contracts acquired see note 10.
The result contributed by NewFinance Capital Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries in the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date was a profit of 2.4 million before tax.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2006, an aggregation of the Groups gross profit for the period and that of the acquiree would have been 806.3 million, and the profit before tax for the period on the same basis would have been 292.8 million.
The Directors note that such aggregations ignore the increased effects of the integration costs and synergistic benefits of the acquisition that would arise over the year since 1 January 2006.
Acquisitions and disposals of consolidated funds As described in note 1 c, the Group is in a position whereby it could control a number of its own funds in which it has seed capital investments.
These funds are consolidated unless they are designated as being held for sale.
During the year, a number of funds fell under the control of the Group and were consolidated as acquisitions.
Similarly, a number of funds ceased to be controlled by the Group in the year and were deconsolidated as they were either deemed to be disposals as a result of the dilution of the Groups existing holdings or the investments were sold.
Net assets acquired on the acquisition of a controlled fund impact on the Groups balance sheet to the extent that the Group consolidates the net assets of the minority interests and records a non-equity minority interest creditor equal to this value.
The net assets acquired in the table below therefore represent those assets acquired attributable to minority interests.
Net assets disposed of when a previously consolidated fund ceases to be controlled by the Group represent either the disposal for cash of an existing investment or the deemed disposal through dilution of those net assets formerly attributable to minority interests of the Group.
Details of such assets and liabilities acquired and disposed of during the year are as follows: Acquisitions Disposals Net mn mn mn Cash 0.4 4.1 3.7 Debt securities 25.7 29.1 3.4 Derivative assets 0.2 0.5 0.3 Equities 2.4 6.4 4.0 Non-equity minority interests see note 32 28.7 40.1 11.4 The acquisitions give rise to an initial cash outflow representing the purchase of the investments.
Such cash flows are recorded within net purchases of proceeds from current asset investments for the purposes of the Groups consolidated cash flow statement.
Disposals only have a related cash flow effect where the Group sells its investment in a fund.
