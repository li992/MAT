Segmental analysis Primary reporting format business segments The group provides communications services which include networked IT services, local and international telecommunications services and broadband and internet products and services.
The group is organised into three primary business segments: BT Retail, BT Wholesale and BT Global Services, each with differing risks, rewards and customer proles.
Hence these lines of business are the groups primary reporting segments.
The revenue of each business segment is derived as follows: BT Retail derives its revenue from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines, the leasing of private circuits and other private services.
It also generates revenue from broadband, mobility, data, internet and multimedia services and from providing managed and packaged communications solutions to customers.
BT Wholesale derives its revenue from providing network services and solutions to communications companies, including xed and mobile network operators, ISPs internet service providers and other service providers, including other BT lines of business, and from carrying transit trafc between telecommunications operators.
BT Global Services mainly generates its revenue from the provision of networked IT services, outsourcing and systems integration work to major corporates and from the xed network operations of the groups worldwide subsidiaries.
Other includes the groups corporate and internal property, vehicle eet and IT operations.
Openreach was launched on 21 January 2006.
We will have completed the separation, conguration and implementation of the financial and operating systems to facilitate the separate reporting of Openreach by the first quarter of the 2007 financial year.
This is in accordance with the timetable specified by the Undertakings.
Therefore, as Openreach is not a discrete segment at 31 March 2006 it is not presented as a separate business segment.
There is extensive trading between the lines of business and the line of business profitability is dependent on the transfer price levels.
For regulated products and services those transfer prices are market based whilst for other products and services the transfer prices are agreed between the relevant lines of business.
These intra-group trading arrangements are subject to periodic review.

Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this analysis current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
This denition of net debt measures balances at the future cash ows due to arise on maturity of financial instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges and the use of the amortised cost method as required by IAS 39.
In addition the gross balances are adjusted to take account of netting arrangements amounting to 171 million.
Net debt is a non GAAP measure since it is not dened in IFRS but it is a key indicator used by management in order to assess operational performance.

Impairment tests of goodwill Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing the groups cash generating units are considered to be the business segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units as follows: 2006 2005 m m BT Global Services 488 360 BT Retail 55 44 543 404 The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit CGU is based on value in use calculations.
These are determined using cash ow projections derived from financial budgets approved by the board covering a five year period.
They reect managements expectation of revenue growth, operating costs and margin for each CGU based on past experience.
Cash ows beyond the five year period have been extrapolated using estimated terminal growth rates ranging from 0% to 2%.
These rates have been determined with regard to projected growth rates for the specic markets in which the CGU participates and are not considered to exceed the long term average growth rates for those markets.
Discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for non-regulated products of 11.4%.
The forecasts are most sensitive to changes in projected revenue growth rates in the first five years of the forecast period.
However there is significant headroom and based on the sensitivity analysis performed we have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

b The interest rate payable on these notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moodys or Standard and Poors S&P reduces the rating ascribed to the groups senior unsecured debt below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A minus in the case of S&P.
In this event, the interest rate payable on the notes and the spread applicable to the floating notes will be increasedby 0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each rating agency.
In addition, if Moodys or S&P subsequently increase the ratings ascribed to the groups senior unsecured debt, then the interest rate then payable on notes and the spread applicable to the floating notes will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency, but in no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum interest rate reflected in the above table.

Deferred taxation continued At the balance sheet date, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 8.6 billion.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of those unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignicant.

Leases have an average term of 25 years and rentals are xed for an average of 25 years.
At 31 March 2006, other than disclosed below there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum likely exposure is US$72 million 42 million as at 31 March 2006, although this could increase by a further US$545 million 314 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS auction.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor is in the process of appealing the courts decision.
If the appeal is successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim.
The European Commission is formally investigating the way the UK Government has set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications.
The Commission is examining whether the Government has complied with EC Treaty rules on state aid in assessing BTs rates.
BTs rates were set by the Valuation Ofce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles, in a transparent process.
In BTs view, any allegation of state aid is groundless and BT is confident that the Government will demonstrate the fairness of the UK ratings system.
A nding against HM Government could result in BT having to repay any amount of state aid it may be determined to have received.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential nding.

Retirement benefit schemes Background The group offers retirement schemes to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
The BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme.
Under this dened contribution scheme the income statement charge represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension costs of the group, included within the staff costs, in the year was 603 million 2005: 540 million, of which 552 million 2005: 507 million related to the groups main dened benefit pension scheme, the BTPS.
The increase in the pension cost in the 2006 financial year principally reects the introduction part way through the 2005 financial year of Smart Pensions, a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and for the company to make additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result there has been a switch between wages and salaries and pension costs of 19 million in the year.
The pension cost applicable to the groups main dened contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2006 was 19 million 2005: 11 million and 2 million 2005: 1 million of contributions to the scheme were outstanding at 31 March 2006.
The group occupies two properties owned by the BTPS scheme on which an annual rental of 2 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2006, the UK equities included 15 million 2005: 17 million ordinary shares of BT Group plc with a market value of 33 million 2005: 36 million.
IAS 19 accounting valuation In accordance with the amendments to IAS 19, Employee Benets in December 2004, the disclosures below are provided prospectively from the 2005 financial year onwards.
BT has applied the accounting requirements under IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at market value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income statement, in retained earnings and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The financial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial accounting valuations of the BTPS under IAS 19 at 31 March 2006 are: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2006 2005 2006 2005 % % % % Rate used to discount liabilities 2.19 2.63 5.00 5.40 a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 1.00 3.52 3.73 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.75 2.70 Ination average increase in retail price index 2.75 2.70 a There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.5% for the first three years.

Retirement benefit schemes continued Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense and the cumulative gain recognised is 2,416 million at 31 March 2006 2005: 294 million.
The actual return on plan assets was 6,925 million 2005: 3,582 million.

The expected returns on xed interest and interest linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above, yields on government bonds and consensus economic forecasts of future returns.
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income.
The history of experience gains and losses are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Present value of dened benefit obligation 38,187 34,435 Less: Fair value of plan assets 35,640 29,628 Net pension obligation 2,547 4,807 Experience adjustment on dened benefit obligation 527 437 Percentage of the present value of the dened benefit obligation 1.4% 1.3% Experience adjustment on plan assets 4,855 1,664 Percentage of the plan assets 13.6% 5.6% The group expects to contribute approximately 630 million to the BTPS, including 232 million of deficiency contributions, in the 2007 financial year.

Retirement benefit schemes continued The mortality assumption has been updated to reect experience and expected future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows: 2006 2005 Number of years Number of years Male 23.8 23.3 Female 25.4 25.0 Future improvement every 10 years 1.0 0.5 The assumed discount rate, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions.
Impact on deficit Increase decrease bn 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.4 salary increases 0.3 Additional 1.0 year increase to life expectancy 1.5 Funding valuation A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2005, is currently being performed and reviewed in the context of recent regulatory developments and the impact of the Crown Guarantee granted on privatisation in 1984.
Until that concludes contributions will continue to be paid in accordance with the 2002 funding plan.
The contributions for the 2005 and 2006 financial years were based on the 31 December 2002 valuation.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December because this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2002 1999 1996 2002 1999 1996 valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%%%% Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 2.38 3.80 7.13 5.45 7.95 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 1.00 0.75 3.53 4.03 4.78 Return on future investments 4.00 4.00 4.25 6.60 7.12 8.42 Average increase in retail price index 2.50 3.00 4.00 a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.5 1.75 1.75 4.04 4.80 5.82 Average increase in pensions 2.50 3.00 3.75-4.00 a There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.

Retirement benefit schemes continued At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 22.8 billion 1999: 29.7 billion and were sufficient to cover 91.6% 1999: 96.8% of the benets accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension benets for employees leaving under release schemes since that date.
This represents a funding deficit of 2.1 billion compared to 1.0 billion at 31 December 1999.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuarys view of the median estimate basis, the funding deficit would have been reduced to 0.4 billion.
Although the market value of equity investments had increased and the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid by 0.3 billion in the three years ended 31 December 2005, the deficit has not improved by the same amount as the liabilities have been calculated on a more product basis.
As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group agreed to make employers contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2006 and annual deficiency payments of 232 million.
This compared to the employers contribution rate of 11.6% and annual deficiency payments of 200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2006, the group made regular contributions of 396 million 2005: 376 million.
Additional special contributions were paid for enhanced pension benets to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2004 of nil 2005: 6 million.
deficiency contributions of 54 million were also made 2005: nil as a result of the early payment of 380 million made in the 2004 financial year that was scheduled for payment in subsequent years.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
The agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of 15 years.
The group will continue to make deficiency payments until the deficit is made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.
Directors emoluments and pensions For the year ended 31 March 2006 the aggregate emoluments of the directors was 4,809,000 2005: 3,276,000.
This includes deferred bonuses of 1,701,000 2005: 457,000 which have been awarded and are payable in 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc in three years time.
Retirement benets were accruing to three directors 2005: three under a dened benefit pension scheme.
During the year no director exercised options 2005: nil under BT Group share option plans.
Four directors 2005: five received or are entitled to receive 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc under BT long-term incentive plans.
The aggregate value of BT Group plc shares vested in directors during the year under BT long-term incentive plans was 258,000.
The emoluments of the highest paid director were 3,010,000 2005: 1,736,000.
He is entitled to receive 5,080,067 BT Group plc 5p ordinary shares under BT long-term incentive plans.
He did not exercise any share options.
Included in the above aggregate emoluments are those of Ben Verwaayen and Hanif Lalani, who are also directors of the ultimate parent company, BT Group plc.
The directors do not believe it is practicable for the purposes of this report to apportion the amounts of total emoluments received by them between their services as directors of the company and their services as directors of BT Group plc.
Share based payment plans The total charge recognised in the income statement for the year in respect of share based payment plans was 76 million 2005: 50 million.
The total value of share options and awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2006 was 64 million 2005: 77 million.
The ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, has an employee share investment plan and savings-related share option plans for the employees of the company and those of its participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected group employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.
It also has several share plans for executives.
All share based payment plans are equity settled and details of these plans are provided below.
Share option plans BT Group Employee Sharesave plans There is an HM Revenue and Customs-approved savings related share option plan, under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a three or five year period, towards the purchase of shares at a xed price determined when the option is granted.
This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five year plans and 10% for three year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Options are granted annually, usually in June.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.
Employees may cancel sharesave options and remain employed by the group.
In such cases the options cancelled do not vest and the monthly savings contributions are returned to the employee, with interest if applicable.
Such events are accounted for by ceasing to record a share based payments charge from the date of the employees withdrawal from the relevant plan.
Previously recorded compensation expense is not reversed, and no charge is made for the accelerated vesting of future options that will not now vest.
For options outstanding at 31 March 2006 and 2005, the weighted average exercise prices are shown below.
2006 2005 Number of Weighted Number of Weighted share average share average options exercise options exercise millions price millions price Outstanding at the beginning of the year 262 169p 233 180p Granted during the year 59 179p 91 149p Forfeited during the year 20 173p 59 176p Exercised during the year 2 215p Expired during the year 20 216p 3 176p Outstanding at the end of the year 279 166p 262 169p Exercisable at the end of the year 16 218p Options were exercised regularly throughout the year.
The weighted average option price of options exercised during the year was 205p 2005: 183p.
The weighted average fair value of savings related share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2006 has been estimated on the date of grant using a binominal option pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected life extending three months later than the first exercise date: share price at date of grant of 223p: estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5% 2005: 5% : risk free interest rates of approximately 4% 2005: 5% : and expected volatility of approximately 25% 2005: 25%.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility over a three year period, which is expected to reect the share price of BT in the future.
The exercise prices are 192p for sharesave options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 171p for sharesave options exercisable five years after the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2006 was 44p 2005: 41p for sharesave options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 55p 2005: 52p for sharesave options exercisable five years after the date of grant.
Options granted under BTs international sharesave, which is a three year plan, have been valued using the same assumptions.
The weighted average fair value of these share options is 49p 2005: 52p.
The exercise price is 171p, and the share price at date of grant was 214p.
Global Share Option Plan GSOP There were no options granted under the GSOP in the 2006 financial year.
The options granted in previous years will be exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets.
These options were valued using Monte Carlo Simulations.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under the 2005 GSOP was estimated as 36p.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: dividend yield of 5%, expected volatility of 25% and risk free interest rates of 4%.

Share-based payment plans continued BT Group Legacy Option Plan On the demerger of O2, BTs share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave plans and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was launched on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger of O2 in November 2001, and is therefore outside the scope of IFRS 2.
Replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were granted to all participants in the executive option plans who had released their options over British Telecommunications plc shares.
The value of the replacement options was determined by averaging the combined prices of BT Group plc and O2 plc shares over the 20 dealing days following the demerger on 19 November 2001.
This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former option over British Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option.
The option prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under option.
The options are exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
For options outstanding at 31 March 2006 and 2005 in respect of the BT Global Share Option Plan and the BT Group Legacy Option Plan, the weighted average exercise prices are shown below.

Under the plans, company shares are conditionally awarded to participants.
Under the ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group.
The corporate performance measure is BTs total shareholder return TSR measured against a group of companies from the European Telecom Sector at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
The ISP was operated in the 2006 financial year with 1,382 participants receiving awards over 23,183,408 shares 2005: 1,406 participants received awards over 12,654,013 shares.
Awards under the ISP have been valued using Monte Carlo Simulations.
TSRs were generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three year performance period, using each companys volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlations between pairs of stocks.
Simulations were run using averaged one and three year volatility and dividend yield for BT and the comparator group.
The weighted average fair value of awards of shares granted under the ISP has been estimated at 124p 2005: 98p.
Historical dividend yields of 4.8% and 4.1% and volatility of 18% and 24% were used in the one year and three year models respectively.
Under the RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest in annual tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the participant is still employed by the group.
During the 2006 financial year 1,107,330 shares vested in 16 participants in the RSP 2005: 1,340,256 shares vested in 11 participants.
The BT Deferred Bonus Plan DBP was established in 1998 and awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Under this plan, shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continued to be employed by the group throughout that period.
On 1 August 2005, 1,966,496 shares 2 August 2004: 1,280,934 shares were transferred to 193 participants 2 August 2004: 219 participants at the end of the three year deferred period.
At 31 March 2006, 24.7 million shares 2005: 27.8 million shares in the company were held in trust for employee share plans, of which 12.4 million shares 2005: 12.7 million shares were held for the ISP, 2.9 million shares 2005: 2.8 million shares were held for the RSP and 5.9 million shares 2005: 7.9 million shares were held for the DBP.
In accordance with the terms of the plan dividends or dividend equivalents earned on the shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
Awards under the DBP and RSP were valued by reference to the weighted average market price of the shares on the date of grant of 223p and 216p respectively.

Share-based payment plans continued Employee Share Investment Plan The BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP has been in operation since December 2001.
The ESIP, which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs, comprises directshare and allshare.
Under directshare, UK employees are given an opportunity to purchase shares partnership shares monthly out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of 1,500 per year.
During the 2006 financial year, 6.4 million shares 2005: 6.1 million shares, including 0.8 million shares 2005: 0.2 million shares purchased by dividend reinvestment, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 14,443 2005: 13,017 employees at a total cost of 13.7 million 2005: 11.7 million.
Allshare, the free shares element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years.
Employees outside the UK receive cash awards equivalent to the value of the free shares.
In 2006, 1% 2005: 0.5% of pre-tax profits, amounting to 22 million, was allocated to allshare 2005: 11 million.
Up to 2% of pre-tax profits would have been available subject to meeting two corporate performance targets: one of these to maintain earnings per share at the same level as in the 2005 financial year, and the other to have five percent more customers very or extremely satisfied with BT provided the percentage of customers who are dissatisfied did not increase compared with the 2005 financial year.
The earnings per share target was met but not the one for customer satisfaction.
The ESIP replaced the BT Employee Share Ownership Scheme which operated for employee profit sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, for employees in the US, enables participants to purchase American Depositary Shares ADS quarterly at a price the Initial Base Option Price which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the start of the Initial Enrolment Period or, in the case of employees who enrol in the ESPP after the Initial Enrolment Period, 85% of the fair market price of an ADS on the last business day of the calendar quarter immediately following enrolment.
From 15 May 2005 to 15 May 2006, 1,750,560 shares 175,056 ADSs have been transferred to participants out of treasury under the ESPP from 15 May 2004 to 15 May 2005, 934,782 shares 93,478 ADSs.
The third offer, with an Initial Base Option Price of US$31.52 ended in December 2005.
A fourth offer was launched in December 2005 with an Initial Base Option Price of US$32.53 and will expire in December 2006.
Audit services The auditors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2006 for the group was 5,549,000 2005: 4,356,000.
The audit fees payable to the companys auditors,  LLP, for the company and UK subsidiary undertakings statutory accounts were 3,307,000 2005: 2,414,000.
The following fees for audit and non-audit services were paid or are payable to the companys auditors,  LLP, for the years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005.

In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non audit services can be provided by the companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value added benets to the company.
BTs regulatory obligations require it to publish audited regulatory financial statements.
The fees for regulatory work principally reect the audit fees associated with those regulatory financial statements.
The fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax advisory services.

Financial instruments and risk management The group adopted IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 April 2005.
Financial information was previously prepared under UK GAAP for the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
Where applicable, information for the comparative period has been separately disclosed below in order to comply with the previous requirements of UK GAAP.
The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and, to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper supported by a committed borrowing facility.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies.
Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts and interest and cross currency swaps.
The group also uses financial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its overseas short-term investment funds and other non-UK assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The financial instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies and forward currency contracts and interest and cross currency swaps.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The groups prole of borrowings and short-term funds is managed with consideration of the cash ow from operations.
These borrowings and short-term funds are managed by the centralised treasury operation.
The types of financial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation.
Shortterm investment in financial instruments is partially undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain dened derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversication and maturity proles.
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment and the groups financial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit risk.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and the objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the policy for the groups centralised treasury operation and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and investments under its management.
Counterparty credit risk is closely monitored and managed within controls set by the Board.
During the year ended 31 March 2006 the groups net debt note 9 reduced from 8.0 billion to 7.6 billion mainly due to operational and working capital inows.
During the 2006 financial year two substantial notes matured, namely the 2005 US dollar 7.875% notes and 2006 Euro 6.375% notes amounting to 3.8 billion and were primarily funded from current financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.
The group utilised its commercial paper programme during the year, which was supported by a committed borrowing facility, as well as raising a sterling oating rate borrowing of 1 billion.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the groups net debt reduced from 8.5 billion to 8.0 billion mainly from working capital inows and proceeds from the sale of investments.
During the 2005 financial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio.
As a result, the group terminated cross currency and interest rate swaps with a total nominal of 2.9 billion.
A number of new swaps were transacted which had the same risk management objective as some of those swaps which were terminated.
This resulted in the group paying 107 million in reducing gross debt and receiving a net 14 million of interest receipts.
The interest receipts and payments on restructuring were included within deferred income and other debtors respectively and were to be amortised to the income statement over the term of the underlying hedged debt.
Upon adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 April 2005, a portion of the interest payments on restructuring was written off to reserves.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2006 and the date of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management The group has interest bearing financial assets and financial liabilities.
The groups policy is to ensure that at least 70% of net debt is at xed rates.
In order to manage this prole, the group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed sterling interest rates after applying the impact of hedging instruments.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts totalling 5.1 billion compared to 5.3 billion at 31 March 2005.
At 31 March 2006, the groups xed:oating interest rate prole, after hedging, on net debt was 84:16 2005: 95:5.
Based on the composition of net debt at 31 March 2006, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the groups annual finance expense by around 10 million.
This is consistent with the position at 31 March 2005.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 67 Filename: 824571 4.3d Time: 18:23:01 Date: 22 05 06 Checksum: 291328993 33.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Foreign exchange risk management The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
Most of the groups current revenue is invoiced in pounds sterling, and most of its operations and costs arise within the UK.
The groups foreign currency borrowings, which totalled 5.4 billion at 31 March 2006, are used to finance its operations.
The borrowings have been predominantly swapped to sterling.
Cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the groups operations and the groups net assets.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally US dollar and euro denominated.
As a result of these policies, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on the residual currency exposure on its non-UK investments in its subsidiaries and on imbalances between the value of outgoing and incoming international calls.
A 10% strengthening in sterling against major currencies would cause the groups net assets at 31 March 2006 to fall by less than 150 million, with an insignicant effect on the groups profits.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding contracts to sell or purchase foreign currency with a total gross notional principal of 6.4 billion 2005: 9.8 billion.
The majority of these instruments were cross currency swaps with a remaining term ranging from one to 25 years.
The values of forward currency contracts included in the gross notional principal at 31 March 2006 were 809 million 2005: 427 million for purchases of currency and 781 million 2005: 782 million for sales of currency.
The forward currency contracts had a term remaining ranging from three to 364 days.
Credit risk management The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk.
The group, however, is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into a netting arrangement to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk.
Currently the group makes use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation.
In addition, where management have a legal right of set off and the ability and intention to settle net, the relevant asset and liabilities are netted within the balance sheet.
The group seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at 31 March 2006 is represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.
Liquidity risk management The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into long and short term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The groups liquidity and funding management process includes projecting cash ows and considering the level of liquid assets in relation thereto, monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources and back-up facilities.
Liquid assets surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are generally invested and managed by the centralised treasury function.
Requirements of group companies for operating finance are met whenever possible from central resources.
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities.
During the year the group utilised its commercial paper programme which was supported by a committed borrowing facility of up to 1,535 million 2005: 145 million.
Of this total, 1,500 million of the borrowing facility is available for a period of five years.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period.
Price risk management The group has limited exposure to equity securities price risk on investments held by the group.
Hedging activities The group entered into a combination of interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as a combination of fair value and cash ow hedges in order to hedge certain risks associated with the the groups US dollar and euro borrowings.
The risks being hedged consist of currency cash ows associated with future interest and principal payments and the fair value risk of certain elements of borrowings arising from uctuations in currency rates and interest rates.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements in cash ow hedges against borrowings with a total notional principal amount of 3.2 billion.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date comprised liabilities of 405 million.
The interest rate swaps have a remaining term ranging from four to 25 years to match the underlying hedged cash ows arising on the borrowings consisting of annual and semi-annual interest payments.
The interest receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 4.6% and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 5.9%.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding cross currency swap agreements in cash ow and fair value hedges against borrowings with a total notional principal amount of 4.8 billion.
The fair value of these cross currency swaps at the balance sheet date comprised 32 million assets and 433 million liabilities.
The cross currency swaps have a remaining term ranging from one to 25 years to match the underlying hedged borrowings consisting of annual and semi-annual interest payments.
The interest receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 8.0% and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 8.5%.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ow hedges of currency cash ows associated with certain euro and US dollar step up interest payments on bonds.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of 77 million.
The fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts at the balance sheet date comprised an asset of 1 million and had a remaining term of between three and 11 months after which they will be rolled into new contracts.
The hedged interest cash ows arise on a semi-annual basis and extend over a period of up to 12 years.
Spot movements on forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ow hedges of currency cash ows associated with certain euro and US dollar commercial paper issues.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of 434 million.
The fair value of the forward currency contracts at the balance sheet date comprised assets of 6 million and had a remaining term of between one and two months to match the cash ows on maturity of the underlying commercial paper.
Spot movements on forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ow hedges against spot movements on currency cash ows associated with the forecast purchase of xed assets and invoice cash ows arising on certain dollar denominated supplies.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of 6 million assets and 197 million liabilities and a remaining term of less than one month after which they will be rolled into new contracts.
The forecast cash ows are anticipated to arise over a period of one month to six years from the balance sheet date.
The group has hedged spot movements on currency cash ows associated with US dollar denominated investments using forward currency contracts.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of 759 million.
The fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts at the balance sheet date comprised liabilites of 5 million and had a remaining term of less than one month.
Other derivatives At 31 March 2006, the group recognised the fair value of an option contained in a supplier contract which required separate recognition.
The option allows the supplier to acquire a certain share in one of the groups investments based on the volume of trade.
In addition, two embedded derivatives expired during the year.
The first related to an option exercisable on the groupsUS dollar convertible bond see note 5 and the second related to a put option whose value was based on an underlying interest differential between sterling xed and oating interest rates.
At 31 March 2006, the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts that were not in hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales and had a notional principal amount of 16 million assets and 101 million liabilities as at 31 March 2006 and a maturity period of under 12 months.
Interest rate swaps not in hedging relationships under IAS 39 had a notional principal amount of 1.9 billion at 31 March 2006 and mature between 2014 and 2030.
The interest receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 6.1% and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 7.7%.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their valuation movements.
Fair value of financial instruments The following table discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates to its fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2006 and 2005.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The fair value of the financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
In particular, the fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
The carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the investments held.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the amounts receivable and payable.
The fair value of the groups bonds, debentures, notes, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
The fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts where the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ow models, that the group would receive or pay in order to terminate such contracts in an arms length transaction taking into account market rates of interest and foreign exchange of the balance sheet date.

Explanation of transition to IFRS These are the groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with EU-adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out on pages 27 to 34 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, the comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the preparation of an opening balance sheet at 1 April 2004, the groups date of transition.
IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation have not been applied to the comparative periods because the group has taken a transitional exemption and adopted these standards prospectively from 1 April 2005.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the group has made adjustments to amounts previously reported in its financial statements under UK GAAP.
IFRS and UK GAAP are not directly comparable.
An explanation of how the transition from previous UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the groups financial position is set out below.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued First time adoption exemptions applied IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards sets out the transitional rules which must be applied when IFRS is applied for the first time.
The group is required to select accounting policies in accordance with IFRS valid at its first IFRS reporting date and apply those policies retrospectively.
The standard sets out certain mandatory exceptions to retrospective application and certain optional exemptions.
The exemptions adopted by the group are as set out below.
Business combinations: the group has elected not to apply IFRS 3, Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before the date of transition 1 April 2004.
Employee benets: the group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses from employee benets schemes at the date of transition.
All subsequent actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benets as amended on 16 December 2004.
Share based payments: the group has elected to apply IFRS 2, Share Based Payment to all equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 and which were not fully vested as at 1 January 2005.
Cumulative translation differences: the group has elected to reset the foreign currency translation reserve to zero at the transition date.
Any gains and losses on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will exclude any translation differences arising prior to the date.
Financial instruments: the group has chosen to utilise the exemption from the requirements to restate comparative information for IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and hence these standards have been applied prospectively as of 1 April 2005.
Notes to explain the effects of IFRS in the financial statements a.
Employee benets Under UK GAAP, the group previously measured pension commitments and other related post-retirement benets in accordance with SSAP 24, Accounting for Pension Costs with additional disclosures provided in accordance with FRS 17, Retirement Benets.
Under IFRS the group measures pension commitments and other related post-retirement benets in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benets.
Under IAS 19 the income statement charge is split between an operating charge and a net finance charge.
The net finance charge relates to the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the scheme offset by the expected return on the assets of the scheme, based on conditions prevailing at the start of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in reserves.
Under SSAP 24, the asset on the balance sheet represented the timing differences between the pension charge recognised in the profit and loss account and the payments made to the pension scheme.
Under IAS 19, the liability on the balance sheet represents the deficit in the pension scheme.
The scheme assets are valued at market value and the liabilities are discounted using a high quality corporate bond rate.
Under SSAP 24, pension charges for the year ended 31 March 2005 were 465 million, including a charge for the amortisation of the SSAP 24 deficit in the BTPS, and an interest credit relating to the balance sheet prepayment.
Under IAS 19 the total charges for the year ended 31 March, 2005 were 342 million, split between an operating charge and net finance income.
Accordingly, for the year ended 31 March, 2005 there is an additional 75 million charge to operating profit and 198 million of net finance income has been recognised under IAS 19.
A related deferred tax charge of 37 million has also been recognised.
The net effect has been an increase in profit of 86 million.
A pension liability has been recognised at 31 March 2005 of 4,807 million and a deferred tax asset of 1,434 million, offset by the reversal of provisions of 44 million for 31 March 2005.
The pension prepayment on the UK GAAP balance sheet of 1,118 million has also been reversed, including the associated deferred tax liability.
The net effect has been a reduction in equity at 31 March 2005 of 4,092 million.
A pension liability has been recognised at 1 April 2004 of 5,136 million and a deferred tax asset of 1,541 million, offset by the reversal of provisions of 36 million.
The pension prepayment of 1,172 million has also been reversed, including the associated deferred tax liability.
The net effect has been a reduction in equity at 1 April 2004 of 4,390 million.
Share based payment Under UK GAAP an expense was recognised for the award of share options and shares based on their intrinsic value the difference between the exercise price and the market value at the date of the award, with the credit recognised as a liability.
The majority of BTs share based payments are made under all employee Save As You Earn plans which were exempt under UK GAAP and the intrinsic value of many of the senior management schemes is nil.
Under IFRS 2, Share Based Payment, an expense is recognised in the income statement for all share based payments both awards of options and awards of shares.
This expense is based on the fair value at the date of grant of the award, using an option pricing model, and is charged to the income statement over the related performance period.
The adoption of IFRS 2 has resulted in an increased operating charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 of 28 million.
A related deferred tax benefit of 7 million, has also been recognised, with the net effect being a decrease in profit of 21 million.
The credit entry for the share based payments is recognised directly in reserves as the awards are equity settled and therefore the liability recognised under UK GAAP has been reclassied to equity.
The net effect has been an increase in equity of 18 million at 31 March 2005.
74 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Filename: 824571 4.3d Time: 18:23:06 Date: 22 05 06 Checksum: 293301840 34.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued c. Goodwill and other intangible assets UK GAAP required goodwill to be amortised over its expected useful economic life.
Under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, goodwill is no longer amortised but held at its carrying value on the balance sheet and tested annually for impairment.
In addition, IAS 38, Intangible Assets requires other intangible assets arising on acquisitions after the transition date to be separately identied and amortised over their useful economic life, often a shorter period than previously used for goodwill.
As a result, intangible assets such as customer relationships and trademarks, need to be separately valued and recognised on business combinations, and then amortised over their useful economic lives.
The UK GAAP goodwill amortisation charge in the year to 31 March 2005 of 16 million has been reversed.
The other intangible assets arising from acquisitions since 1 April 2004 are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Computer software that is not an integral part of the associated hardware is classied as an intangible asset under IAS 38.
Under UK GAAP, the groups policy was to categorise all capitalised software as tangible xed assets.
This has resulted in a balance sheet reclassication of 615 million as at 31 March 2005, but has had no impact on profit or equity.
d. Dividends Under UK GAAP, the dividend charge was recognised in the profit and loss account in the period to which it related.
Under IAS 10, Events After The Balance Sheet Date, dividends are not recognised in the income statement but directly in reserves.
In addition, the final dividend is recognised only when it has been declared and approved by the company in general meeting.
The final dividend liability for the 2004 financial year of 454 million has been reversed at 1 April 2004 as the associated dividend had not been approved at this date.
e. Leases Under IAS 17 Leases there is a requirement to view leases of land separately from leases of buildings.
Furthermore, there is a requirement to recognise operating lease charges as an expense on a straight line basis.
As a result, the building elements of a small number of properties have been reclassied from operating leases under UK GAAP to finance leases under IFRS, and lease rentals under the groups 2001 sale and operating leaseback transaction are recognised on a straight line basis under IFRS.
For those properties reclassied as finance leases, profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been reduced by approximately 3 million as a result of the recognition of depreciation and finance lease interest charges, and the removal of the UK GAAP operating lease charges.
Recognising the operating lease charges, on a straight line basis has further reduced the profit before tax for the year ended 31 March, by 101 million.
A deferred tax benefit of 31 million has also been recognised, with the net effect being a 73 million reduction in profit.
Those properties reclassied as finance leases have been capitalised and are included within property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the lease asset, which was 93 million at 1 April 2004 and 90 million at 31 March 2005 respectively.
The associated finance lease obligation has also been recognised, being 105 million and 107 million at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005, respectively.
The excess of the sales proceeds over the previous carrying value has been deferred, and is being recognised in the income statement over the lease term.
The deferred gain included in deferred income at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 was 44 million and 42 million, respectively.
Where the operating lease rentals are recognised on a straight line basis, the difference between the amounts recognised in the income statement and the lease payments is included in other creditors, and amounted to 251 million and 352 million at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 respectively.
A deferred tax liability of 100 million and 123 million at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 has been recognised.
The net effect of the above has been a reduction in equity of 215 million and 288 million at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005, respectively.
f. Financial instruments Under UK GAAP, the group previously measured financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the principles of FRS 4, Capital Instruments, FRS 5, Reporting the Substance of Transactions and SSAP 20, Foreign Currency Translation.
Current asset investments were recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Debt instruments were stated at the amount of the net proceeds adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
Debt and current asset investments were further adjusted for the effect of the currency element of swaps and forward contracts used as a hedge against these instruments.
The group also provided disclosures in accordance with FRS 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures setting out the objectives, policies and strategies for holding or issuing financial instruments, and the fair value of financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.
IAS 39 requires all derivative financial instruments to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet on transition at 1 April, 2005 was a net liability of 1.5 billion.
This fair value included a net liability of 0.7 billion which was previously recognised under UK GAAP, reecting the currency element of financial instruments and accrued interest associated with derivatives.
The additional net liability of 0.8 billion arising on transition resulted in a corresponding net decrease to equity.
Future market interest rate and currency movements will give rise to adjustments to these fair values.
Where hedge accounting cannot be applied under the prescriptive rules of IAS 39, changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments will impact the income statement.
In addition, the majority of the gains and losses associated with terminated derivative financial instruments that were deferred under UK GAAP have been reclassied to reserves in accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, resulting in an additional net increase to equity of 0.3 billion.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 75 Filename: 824571 4.3d Time: 18:23:06 Date: 22 05 06 Checksum: 253447544 34.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are required to be recorded at amortised cost under IAS 39.
Under UK GAAP, the majority of this amortised cost value was reected on the balance sheet but elements were separately recorded in current assets and current liabilities.
These amounts have been reclassied on transition to either financial assets or loans and borrowings to recognise the respective instruments at amortised cost.
The adjustments described above, on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, have resulted in an overall reduction in total equity as at 1 April 2005 of 476 million 204 million net of deferred taxation.
g. Other adjustments and reclassications There are a number of other minor adjustments and reclassications which include: The groups share of results of associates and joint ventures is presented net of tax and finance income on the face of the income statement.
Previously under UK GAAP the groups share of associates and joint ventures interest and tax was included in the relevant interest and tax line of the income statement.
Liquid investments with maturities of less than three months at acquisition are classied within cash and cash equivalents under IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements rather than as current asset investments under UK GAAP.
Cash ow statements prepared in accordance with IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements have a different presentational format.
Although the underlying cash ows remain the same as previously reported, the cash ow statement reects movements in cash and cash equivalents.
In addition, certain leases are now classied as finance leases which had previously been treated as operating leases.
Under UK GAAP, loans and borrowings and current asset investments were held at foreign currency rates prescribed in the hedging instrument where hedging had been applied in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
Under IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchanges Rates, such forward rate adjustments are required to be disclosed separately and have therefore been reclassied.
On adoption of IAS 39 from 1 April 2005, such forward rate adjustments form part of the overall fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany loans are recognised in the income statement.
Under UK GAAP these amounts were recognised in reserves.
profits on the sale of property xed assets are classied within other operating income on the face of the income statement.
Under UK GAAP, these amounts had previously been disclosed after operating profit.
The group has historically recognised revenue arising from calls to our premium rate numbers on a gross basis, with amounts paid to service providers recorded separately within operating costs.
In light of the transition to IFRS and changing market practice we have reviewed the presentation of these arrangements.
We have decided to change our presentation to a net basis for these calls where we provide basic transmission and connectivity only.
For those calls where we add value by providing interactivity and a more significant and valuable part of the service, the associated revenue will continue to be reported on a gross basis.
Whilst reducing revenue and operating costs, this change has had no impact on reported profit, cash ows or the balance sheet.
The impact on revenue and operating costs was 194 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS, which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US.
For BT there are no differences between IFRS as adopted for use in the EU and IFRS as published by the IASB.
I Differences between IFRS and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP The following are the main differences between IFRS and US GAAP which are relevant to the groups consolidated financial statements.
a Sale and leaseback of properties Under IFRS, the sale of BTs property portfolio is treated as a disposal and the vast majority of the subsequent leaseback is an operating lease.
Under US GAAP as BT has a continuing interest in the properties, these properties are recorded on the balance sheet at their net book value, a leasing obligation is recognised and the gain on disposal is deferred until the properties are sold and vacated by BT and the corresponding lease obligation is terminated.
Rental payments made by BT are reversed and replaced by a finance lease interest charge and a depreciation charge.
b Pension costs Under IFRS, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
Under US GAAP, pension costs are determined in accordance with the requirements of US Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS Nos.
87 Employers Accounting for Pensions and 88 Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Dened benefit Plans and for Termination Benets.
Differences between the IFRS and US GAAP amounts arise primarily due to differences in recognition of actuarial gains and losses and the application of different measurement dates.
Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense whereas under US GAAP actuarial gains and losses are amortised over the average remaining service period.
Under US GAAP if the accumulated benefit obligation ABO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the employer is required to recognise a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded ABO.
76 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Filename: 824571 4.3d Time: 18:23:06 Date: 22 05 06 Checksum: 246584281 35.
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued c Capitalisation of interest Under IFRS, the group has chosen not to capitalise interest.
Under US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in property, plant and equipment, and depreciated over the lives of the related assets.
The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the average interest rates on outstanding borrowings.
At 31 March 2006 under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest of 350 million 2005: 349 million was subject to depreciation over periods of 3 to 25 years determined by the nature of the related asset.
d Financial instruments The group exercised the exemption available under IFRS 1 to adopt IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 from 1 April 2005.
The comparative periods are therefore presented in accordance with UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedges are not recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised.
Certain derivative financial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify or were not designated as hedges under US GAAP.
From 1 April 2005 the group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 which gave rise to differences in accounting treatments applied under US GAAP SFAS No 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
On adoption of IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments and the fair value of the hedged risks, where a hedged item is in a fair value hedge, were recognised as a one time transition adjustment to equity and resulted in a transitional difference between US GAAP and IFRS.
Under IFRS, certain cash ow hedges result in a hedged non-financial asset or liability being adjusted from the equity reserve for the applicable hedged amount.
US GAAP does not allow the amounts taken to equity to be transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
The amounts remain in equity and are recognised in earnings as the non-financial asset is depreciated or disposed.
The group did not claim hedge accounting under US GAAP for certain items designated as hedges under IFRS.
As a result, certain gains or losses on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve or translation reserve are credited or charged to the income statement under US GAAP.
In addition, under IFRS, the hedged risk associated with a hedged item is fair valued where the item has been designated in a fair value hedge.
As hedge accounting has not been claimed for those items under US GAAP, this fair value adjustment will not be reected.
These differences will reverse out as the derivatives or hedged items mature, are sold or expire.
The fair value and book value of derivative instruments as at 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005 is disclosed in note 33.
IFRS prescribes four investment categories, namely held for trading, available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held to maturity.
US GAAP prescribes only three categories, namely held for trading, available-for-sale and held to maturity.
Whilst the held for trading and available for sale categories are similar under both GAAPs, items held in loans and receivables under IFRS are generally classied as held to maturity under US GAAP.
e Foreign exchange Under US GAAP, on the sale of a foreign enterprise, foreign exchange differences within the cumulative translation adjustment CTA are included in net income in arriving at a gain or loss on disposal.
Although IFRS also requires inclusion of the cumulative translation differences held in reserves as part of the calculation of gains or losses on disposal, they were reset to zero on transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004. f Deferred taxation Under both IFRS and US GAAP, provision for deferred income tax is required on a full provision basis in accordance with IAS 12 Income taxes and SFAS No.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is recorded for temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets not recognised are disclosed in note 21.
Under US GAAP deferred taxes are recorded on all temporary differences and a valuation allowance is established in respect of those deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will remain unrealised.
Additionally, assets and liabilities are presented separately where the timing of further recognition does not match and deferred tax balances are split where applicable between current and non current.
Deferred tax adjustments in the IFRS to US GAAP reconciliation are primarily the result of the deferred tax impact of the other US GAAP adjustments made in the reconciliation.
However, tax adjustments also arise in respect of the timing of recognition of deferred tax on share options and current tax benets.
At 31 March 2006, total deferred tax liabilities were 1,767 million primarily in respect of accelerated capital allowances and total deferred tax assets were 1,454 million, primarily in respect of pension obligations.
The total valuation allowance recognised for deferred tax assets was as follows: Movement 2006 2005 in year m m m Capital losses 5,493 4,436 1,057 Operating losses not utilised 775 860 85 Other 271 705 434 Total 6,539 6,001 538 Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 77 Filename: 824571 4.3d Time: 18:23:06 Date: 22 05 06 Checksum: 227838356 35.
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued g Impairment of property, plant and equipment Certain network assets previously impaired did not meet the US GAAP criteria for impairment under SFAS No.
144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future cash ows.
An impairment exists if the sum of these cash ows is less than the carrying amount of the assets.
The impairment loss recognised in the income statement is based on the assets fair value, being either market value or the sum of discounted future cash ows.
The assets that were not impaired under US GAAP are continuing to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives.
h Revenue Under IFRS, long-term contracts to design, build and operate software solutions are accounted for under IAS 18 Revenue, under which revenue is recognised as earned over the contract period.
Under US GAAP these contracts are accounted for as multiple element arrangements under EITF 00-21 and SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition.
As vendor specic objective evidence to support the fair value of the separate elements to be delivered is unavailable, revenue of 109 million under certain contracts is deferred in the 2006 financial year 2005: 162 million.
There was no impact on net income due to the deferral of costs on these contracts.
Total deferred revenue and costs recorded under US GAAP at 31 March 2006 was 348 million 2005: 239 million.
i Share based payments Under IFRS 2, Share Based Payment, share options are fair valued at their grant date and the cost is charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods.
123 R, Share-Based Payment on 1 April 2005 using the modied prospective transition method.
Previously the company adopted the disclosure-only provisions in SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and accounted for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Under the transition method, compensation cost recognised during the 12 months to 31 March 2006 includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested at 1 April 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to 1 April 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 R. Results for prior periods have not been restated.
As required by SFAS 123 R, the following table illustrates the effects on income from continuing operations, income before tax, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share in respect of the 2005 financial year, when share-based payment arrangements were accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
There were no impacts from adoption on the cash ows of the group.
2005 m Net income as reported 1,980 Share based employee compensation cost included in net income 26 Share based employee compensation cost that would have been included in net income if the fair-value-based method had been applied to all awards 37 Deferred tax 3 Pro forma net income as if the fair-value-based method had been applied to all awards 1,972 j Goodwill The group wrote off goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition prior to 1 April 1998 against retained earnings.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 was capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
Following transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment and the amount of goodwill previously recorded at the transition date was carried forward under IFRS.
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life.
142 on 1 April 2002 and goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.
There was no goodwill impairment charge in the year ended 31 March 2006 2005: nil.
k Property rationalisation provision In the 2003 financial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the groups London ofce property portfolio was recorded.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No.
146, these costs are not recognised until the group fully exits and therefore ceases to use the affected properties.
All these properties were exited by 31 December 2004. l Contingent consideration Under IFRS contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions is recorded when the outcome of the contingency is considered more likely than not.
Under US GAAP the consideration is recorded when the contingent event has occurred.

United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued m Sale of investments and group undertakings In November 2001, the group sold its O2 business to mmO2 plc for 18,489 million.
The transaction was recorded as a sale.
On transition to IFRS, this amount remained an asset of the group.
Under US GAAP, the carrying value of the investment is recognised as a dividend distribution to the groups parent at the time of the transaction.
n Termination benets Under US GAAP, the fair value of termination benets for employees who are to be retained beyond their minimum contractual retention period is recognised on a straight line basis over the future service period.
Under IFRS these costs are recognised when the employees agree to leave the group.
II Net income and shareholders equity reconciliation statements The following statements summarise the material estimated adjustments, gross of their tax effect, which reconcile net income and shareholders equity from that reported under IFRS to that which would have been reported had US GAAP been applied.

United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued III Consolidated statements of cash ows The group cash ow statements are presented in accordance with IAS 7.
The statements prepared under IAS 7 present substantially the same information as that required under SFAS No.
If the cash ow statement had been prepared in accordance with SFAS No.
95, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents would have been higher by 179 million 2005: unchanged.
This is because under IAS 7, bank overdrafts are classied as a movement in cash and cash equivalents, while under US GAAP, the movements in bank overdrafts are classied as a nancing activity.
IV Pension costs The following position for the main pension scheme BTPS is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension accounting rules under SFAS No.
88, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation statements.
The liabilities of the BTPS represent substantially all of the groups pension obligations.
The pension cost determined under SFAS No.
87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate of return on scheme assets of 7.11% 2005: 7.27%.
The components of the net periodic pension cost for the main pension scheme comprised: 2006 2005 m m Service cost 538 507 Interest cost 1,784 1,745 Expected return on scheme assets 2,042 1,897 Amortisation of prior service costs 24 24 Amortisation of loss 215 263 Net periodic pension cost under US GAAP 519 642 The information required to be disclosed in accordance with SFAS No.

b Unrecognised prior service costs on scheme benefit improvements are being amortised over periods of 15 or 16 years commencing in the years of the introduction of the improvements.
Asset allocation The Trustees of the main pension scheme approve the target asset allocation as well as deviation limits.
The objective of the investment activities is to maximise investment returns within an acceptable level of risk, taking into consideration the liabilities of the main pension scheme.

United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued V Income statement in US GAAP format The group income statements on page 35 comply with IFRS and the directors believe they are in the most appropriate format for shareholders to understand the results of our business.
We believe that it is important to show our results before deducting specic items because these items predominantly relate to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group.
For SEC reporting purposes this presentation may be considered non GAAP and therefore the group has also prepared the following income statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X.
The numbers disclosed in the following income statement are prepared under IFRS.
2006 2005 m m Revenue 19,514 18,429 Operating expenses: Payroll costs 4,060 3,826 Depreciation and amortisation 2,884 2,844 Payments to telecommunication operators 4,045 3,725 Other operating expenses 6,249 5,585 Total operating expenses 17,238 15,980 Net operating income 2,276 2,449 Other income, net 228 551 Net interest income 515 368 Income taxes 792 817 Equity in earnings losses of investees 16 39 Minority interests 1 1 Net income 2,242 2,513 VI US GAAP developments In November 2005, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-ThanTemporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which nullifies certain requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No.

D-44, Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Upon the Planned Sale of a Security whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value.
The guidance in this FSP is applied to reporting periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
BT does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash ows.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No.
154 requires retrospective application of prior periodsnancial statements for changes in accounting principles.
154 applies to accounting periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
154 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.
FAS 123 R -4, Classication of Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event FSP FAS 123 R -4.
FSP FAS 123 R -4 addresses the classication of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event.
An option or similar instrument that is classied as equity, but subsequently becomes a liability because the contingent cash settlement event is probable of occurring, shall be accounted for similar to a modication from an equity to liability award.
The application of this FSP did not have a material impact on the results or net assets of the group.
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No.
140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.
This Statement resolves issues addressed in SFAS No.
D1, Application of Statement 133 to beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.
The Statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation.
Additionally it claries which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No.
155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitised financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation.
It claries that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives.
140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument.
155 is effective for BT for all financial instruments acquired or issued after 31 March 2007.
BT is currently evaluating the impact of this statement.
In March 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No.
156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets: an amendment of FASB Statement No.
140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, with respect to the accounting for separately recognised servicing assets and servicing liabilities.
156 is effective for BT on 1 April 2007.
BT does not anticipate that the adoption of this new statement at the required effective date will have a significant effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash ows.

Retirement benets continued Funding valuation A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 22.8 billion 1999: 29.7 billion and were sufficient to cover 91.6% 1999: 96.8% of the benets accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension benets for employees leaving under release schemes since that date.
Although the market value of equity investments had increased and the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid by 0.3 billion in the three years ended 31 December 2002, the deficit has not improved by the same amount as the liabilities have been calculated on a more prudent basis.
As a result of the triennial funding valuation the company agreed to make employers contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2006 and annual deficiency payments of 232 million.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the company is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of 15 years.
The company will continue to make deficiency payments until the deficit is made good.

Interest rate swaps not in hedging relationships under FRS 25 had a notional principal amount of 1.9 billion at 31 March 2006 and mature between 2014 and 2030.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the profit and loss account but is limited due to a natural offset in their valuation movements.
Fair value of financial instruments The following table discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the companys financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates to its fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2006 and 2005.
The carrying amounts are included in the company balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The fair value of the companys bonds, debentures, notes, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
The fair value of the companys outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts where the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ow models, that the company would receive or pay in order to terminate such contracts in an arms length transaction taking into account market rates of interest and foreign exchange of the balance sheet date.

Changes in accounting policies FRS 17, Retirement benets The company previously accounted for retirement benets in accordance with SSAP 24.
The charge to the profit and loss account comprised the cost of providing retirement pensions and other benets, spread over the period benefiting from the employees services.
The company recognised a provision or prepayment which represented the difference between charges in the profit and loss account and contributions paid.
Under FRS 17 the company is able to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the BT Pension dened benefit scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore the companys charge to the profit and loss account comprises the service cost and net finance income calculated in accordance with FRS 17.
Actuarial gains and loss are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet, in respect of dened benefit schemes, is the present value of the dened benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The pension deficit is presented net of deferred tax on the face of the balance sheet.
The implementation of FRS 17 has resulted in a reduction to the companys previously reported net assets by 4,390 million and 4,082 million at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 respectively, and an increase of 86 million to the companys previously reported profit for the year ended 31 March 2005.
It is not practicable to give the effect on the results of the company for the year ended 31 March 2006, had the company not adopted FRS 17.
FRS 20, Share-based payment The company previously accounted for share options and awards granted to its employees by its ultimate parent BT Group plc in accordance with UITF 38 and UITF 17 revised 2003.
The profit and loss account reected the intrinsic value of the share options or awards granted and the charge was recognised on a straight line basis over the period to the date the employee became unconditionally entitled to the options or award, or the performance period, as appropriate.
The credit was recognised as a liability.
Under FRS 20, equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account and spread over the vesting period of the award, with the credit recognised in equity.
The adoption of FRS 20 has resulted in an increase of 31 million in the companys previously reported net assets at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004: nil.
It has also resulted in a reduction of 16 million to the companys previously reported profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Had the company not adopted FRS 20, the profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2006 would have been approximately 22 million higher.
FRS 21, Events after the balance sheet date FRS 21 requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date, because the liability does not represent a present obligation.
Instead dividends will be recognised in the period in which they are declared, approved and paid.
The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in an increase to the companys previously reported net assets by 454 million at 1 April 2004 31 March 2005: nil.
The 2004 final dividend of 454 million is included in the 2005 profit and loss account.
FRS 23, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates The company has adopted FRS 23 with effect from 1 April 2005.
However to provide comparability, certain reclassications have been reected as at 31 March 2005.
Forward exchange contracts used to change the currency mix of loans and other borrowings and investments are revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gains and losses included in current and non current derivative financial instruments.
FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation and FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Measurement The company has adopted FRS 25 and FRS 26 with effect from 1 April 2005.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of those standards, the comparative information for 2005 has not been restated.
The effect of adopting FRS 26 was to reduce net assets at 1 April 2005 by 301 million.
This consists of a gross charge of 176 million 27 million charge net of tax to the cash ow reserve, a gross charge of 399 million to the profit and loss account 279 million net of tax and a credit to the available-for-sale reserve of 5 million.
In accordance with paragraph 3 c of FRS 25, the company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of paragraphs 51 to 95 of FRS 25.
The companys financial instruments are consolidated with those of the group and are incorporated into the disclosures in note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
