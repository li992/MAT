Company Accounting Policies The Vedanta Resources plc the Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP and in accordance with UK company law.
The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
Changes in Accounting Policies The following UK GAAP financial reporting standards were adopted during the year and have an impact on the Company financial statements: FRS 20 Share-based payments FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement.
The adoption of these Standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative information has been restated accordingly except where the exemption from restating comparative information under FRS 25 and FRS 26 has been taken.
The effect of adoption of each of these Standards is summarised below.
FRS 20 Share-based Payments The Standard requires options granted to be measured at fair value at the grant date using an option pricing model and charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the options.
This accounting change has reduced net profit for the Company for the year ended 31 March 2005 by $2.5 million.
Had the previous accounting policy been applied in 2005, the net profit for the Company for the year ended 31 March 2006 would have been $1.6 million higher.
FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date FRS 21 requires that dividends proposed are recognised in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
The change in timing of recognising proposed dividends and the related tax thereon has increased the net assets of the Company at 31 March 2005 by $33.1 million.
Had the previous accounting policy been applied for the year ended 31 March 2006 net profit for the Company would have been $7.9 million lower.
FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation FRS 25 requires financial instrument disclosures and presentation identical to those required by IAS 32.
The Company has elected to take the exemption provided in paragraph 3C b of FRS 25 in respect of these parent company financial statements.
Full disclosures are provided in note 38 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2006.
FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement FRS 26 aligns UK accounting for the measurement of financial instruments with the requirements of IAS 39.
FRS 26 has been applied prospectively from 1 April 2005, as permitted by FRS 26, and as such restated comparative information presented excludes any adjustments required in respect of FRS 26.
The Company has taken the policy option within FRS 26 of presenting its investments in joint ventures and associates at cost.
Significant Accounting Policies Investments in Subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries valued at cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Currency Translation Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company, being US dollars, are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006117 42.
Company Accounting Policies continued Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
Deferred Taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based Payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current expectations.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans are recorded at the net proceeds received i. e. net of direct transaction costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account.
The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the profit and loss account and is offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked-to-market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
The disclosure requirements of FRS 25 do not apply to parent companies in respect of their separate financial statements where the company is included in publicly available consolidated financial statements which include disclosures that comply with IAS 32.
The Groups disclosures in respect of IAS 32 are provided in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements and accordingly no disclosures in respect of FRS 25 are provided in the individual company financial statements.
Cash Flow Statement The Companys individual financial statements are outside the scope of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements because the Company prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, which include a consolidated cash flow statement.
Accordingly, the Company does not present an individual company cash flow statement.
Related Party Disclosures The Companys individual financial statements are exempt from the requirements of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures because its individual financial statements are presented together with its consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, the individual financial statements do not include related party disclosures.
