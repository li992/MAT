2 Segmental analysis The Group is managed in regions United Kingdom, Continental Europe, North America and Asia Pacic.
Continental Europe comprises our operations in France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Republic of Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium.
Asia Pacic comprises our operations in Japan, Australia, Chile, India, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the Philippines, Hong Kong and China.
North America comprises our operations in the United States of America and Canada.
These regions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The Group has only one type of business and therefore does not have separately identiable business segments.
No secondary segment information is therefore given.
Intersegment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Prior year results have been restated to include Japan within Asia Pacic rather than reporting it as a separate segment as this reects the increasing alignment of the Groups management of these businesses.
profit before tax has also been restated to show the Enterprise Business System costs separately.
