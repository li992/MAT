Acquisitions a The acquisition of Gas Distribution Networks by Scotia Gas Networks plc At 1 June 2005, Scotia Gas Networks plc, an entity of which the Group holds 50%, acquired the Scotland and the South of England gas distribution networks from National Grid Transco plc.
The total value of the acquired businesses after finalisation of the completion process was 3,217.8m.
The transaction was initially funded by non-recourse borrowings with the balance being funded by the shareholders.
The Groups share of the initial transaction cost at 1 June 2005 was 483.9m which consisted of 270.0m of subordinated loans and 213.9m of equity funding.
The non-recourse funding of this transaction was replaced by the issue of listed debt by the distribution network entities of 2,219.8m on 21 October 2005.
At 31 March 2006, the Group, through Scotia Gas Networks plc, had invested 521.9m in the gas distribution networks, consisting of 270.0m of subordinated loans, 235.0m of equity funding and 16.9m of capitalised interest.
The subsequent increase to the capital invested in the Scotia Gas Networks group is highlighted in note 12.
The Groups investment in Scotia Gas Networks plc at 31 March 2006 is 455.0m consisting of the 521.9m invested less the opening liability on financing derivatives 62.6m, see below and the loss after interest, tax and movement on derivatives 4.3m, see note 12.
In the 10 months from acquisition, the Groups share of the results of Scotia Gas Networks plc, a jointly controlled entity, contributed 102.7m to the Groups underlying operating profit note 2 and 48.6m after interest excluding loan stock interest payable and financing derivatives.
The Groups share of the mark-to-market impact of the financial derivatives held by the Scotia Gas Networks companies is included in notes 12 and 29.
Scotia Gas Networks plc entered into a contingent interest rate swap on 30 August 2004 subject to the acquisition of the gas networks in Scotland and the south of England being completed.
From 1 April 2005, 50% of the fair value of the swap has been reflected in the Groups accounts including the Groups share of the fair value loss on financing derivatives up to 1 June 2005, when the transaction to acquire the distribution networks was concluded.
Since 1 June 2005, the Groups share of this loss has been reflected as part of the share of losses on financing derivatives within the results of Scotia Gas Networks plc.
On 21 October 2005, the formerly contingent swap was closed off by the issue of a new mirror swap, both of which are marked to market under IAS 39.
The issue of the listed debt at 21 October 2005 was achieved at the same time as entering a number of interest rate and currency swaps, all of which are designated as being effective hedges.
From 1 June 2005, the Groups share of movements on financing derivatives is a charge of 13.0m 9.1m net of tax.
The investment in the jointly controlled entity is accounted for using the equity method.
