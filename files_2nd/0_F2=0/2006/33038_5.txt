Filename: 824560 02.3d Time: 14:33:23 Date: 20 05 06 Checksum: -238905580 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA For the year ended 31 March 2006, the group is required to prepare its audited annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC Interpretations, as adopted by the European Union EU and those parts of the UK Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Previously the group prepared its audited annual financial statements under UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
The 2005 comparative financial statements have therefore been restated as part of the first-time adoption requirements of IFRS.
As allowed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules in relation to first-time adoption of IFRS, only one year of comparative financial statements are presented in this Annual report.
The policies set out on pages 65 to 72 of this report have been applied consistently to the 2006 and 2005 financial years, with the exception of those policies relating to financial instruments under IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39, which have been applied with effect from 1 April 2005.
The selected financial data on pages 22 to 25 is shown in accordance with IFRS for 2006 and 2005 and UK GAAP for 2005 to 2002.
The UK GAAP data should be read in conjunction with the IFRS transition adjustments in note 34 to gain an understanding of the nature of the adjustments made to UK GAAP financial information to comply with IFRS.
IFRS differs in certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The material differences between IFRS and US GAAP relevant to the group are explained on pages 114 to 121.
