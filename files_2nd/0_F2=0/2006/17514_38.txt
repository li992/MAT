Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 | 263 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Xstrata plc the Company has adopted the following principal accounting policies: Investments Equity investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provision for impairments.
Financial Assets Loans and Receivables Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value on the trade date, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
This cost is computed as the amount initially recognised minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initially recognised amount and the maturity amount.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the Company no longer has a right to receive cash flows from the asset.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables have been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss account.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost that would have been measured if there had been no impairment at the reversal date.
Impairment The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amounts.
Such reviews are undertaken on income generating units.
If the carrying values of fixed assets exceed their recoverable amounts, a provision is recorded to reflect the assets at their lower amount.
In assessing the recoverable amounts of fixed assets, the relevant future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of and disposal of the assets have been discounted to their present value using a market-determined discount rate.
Provisions for liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated will be required to settle the obligation.
264 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future.
In particular: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the disposal of fixed assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas entities only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, it is considered that, it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Own shares The cost of purchases of own shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trust are deducted from equity.
Where they are issued to employees or sold, no gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Any proceeds received on the disposal of the shares or on the transfer of shares to employees are recognised in equity.
Share-based payments The Company makes share-based awards, including free shares and options in the Company, to certain employees and Directors of the Group.
The expense recognised in the financial statements relates only to those share-based awards that are granted by the Company, to its employees and Directors and to the employees of the Group who provide services to the Company.
Equity-settled awards For equity-settled awards, the fair value is charged to the profit and loss account and credited to retained earnings, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, after adjusting for the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest taking into account the achievement of nonmarket based performance conditions.
The fair value of the equity-settled awards is determined at the date of the grant.
In calculating fair value, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
The fair value is determined by external experts using the models outlined in note 10.
At each balance sheet date prior to vesting, the cumulative expense representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest is computed after adjusting for non-market performance conditions.
The movement in cumulative expense is recognised in the profit and loss account with a corresponding entry within equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification, over the remainder of the new vesting period.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the awards at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the profit and loss account.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the new award is treated as if it is a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Accounting policies continued Cash-settled awards For cash-settled awards, the fair value is re-calculated at each balance date until the awards are settled based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest adjusting for market and non-market based performance conditions.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the portion of the vesting period which has expired at the balance sheet date times the fair value of the awards at that date.
After vesting the full fair value of the unsettled awards at each balance date is recognised as a liability.
Movements in the liability are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The fair value is recalculated using an option pricing model refer to note 10.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions on adoption of these policies in relation to unvested equity-settled awards and has applied the above policies only to awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005.
Loans from subsidiaries Loans from subsidiaries are recognised at inception at the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs.
Subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs are recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are booked in the functional currency US$ at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities are not restated at balance sheet date.
Revenue Interest income is recognised as earned on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised as earned when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income for other services is recognised when the service has been rendered, when the amount of revenue and associated costs can be reliably measured and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company.
Comparatives Where applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to disclose them on the same basis as current period figures.
Use of estimates The preparation of these financial statements is in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.

Share-based Payments The Group operates a number of share option plans which are outlined below and result in the Company granting options and awards over its shares.
The expense recognised for share-based payments during the year ended 31 December 2006 was US$63 million 2005 US$17 million.
The proportion of that expense arising from equity-settled share-based awards was US$14 2005 US$6 million.
Xstrata plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP has two elements: i A contingent award of free ordinary shares that vests after three years, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied: and ii A share option to acquire ordinary shares at a specified exercise price after the third anniversary of grant, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied.
All LTIP awards that vest are subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria being met over a three-year performance period.
Half of the options and free share awards issued in 2004 and 2005 and one-third issued in 2006 are conditional on Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to a peer group, with the remainder conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale over the three-year period.
The 2003 LTIP awards are only subject to the TSR performance criteria.
For the awards conditional on TSR, one-half of the combined award will vest if TSR growth is at the median of the specified peer group, the full combined award will vest for performance at or above the second decile with straight line vesting between these points.
No vesting will occur for below median performance.
For the remaining award, vesting is conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale: 10% of the combined award will vest for 1% cost savings, 70% for 2% cost savings and all awards for 3% or more cost savings, with straight line vesting between these points.
No vesting will occur if cost savings are less than 1%.
Real cost savings will be measured in relation to operating costs after adjusting for the effects of inflation, excluding depreciation, commodity price linked costs, effects of currencies on translation of local currency costs and planned life of mine adjustments.
No other features of the LTIP awards were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
No consideration will be payable on the vesting of an LTIP award of free ordinary shares.
On exercise of an option, a participant will be required to pay an exercise price which will not be less than the market value of an ordinary share on the date of grant.
Of the below options, 1.9 million 2005: 1.6 million are accounted for as cash-settled share-based awards whilst the remainder of the LTIP awards are equity-settled.
Share-based Payments continued The movement in the number of free ordinary shares and share options are as follows: Free Shares 2006 2006 2005 2005 No.

Share-based Payments continued The following table lists the inputs to the models used to measure the fair value of equity settled awards granted: Date of Date of grant grant 2006 2005 Dividend yield % 1.3 3.14 Expected volatility % 31 31 Risk-free interest rate % 4.4 4.9 Earliest exercise date 10 Mar 2009 11 Mar 2008 Latest exercise date 9 Mar 2016 10 Mar 2015 Expected exercise date 17 Nov 2009 10 Sep 2011 Share price at date of grant GBP 17.03 10.48 Exercise price GBP 17.17 10.60 Free share fair value at date of grant GBP 16.38 9.54 Option fair value at date of grant GBP 4.49 3.05 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historic volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Both the free shares and the equity settled options are equity settled plans and the fair value is measured at the date of grant.
The fair value of the cash settled options is measured at the date of grant and at each reporting date until the liability is settled, using the Black Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award.
Xstrata AG incentive plan With the merger of Xstrata AG into Xstrata plc, Xstrata plc assumed the obligations of Xstrata AG under the scheme with the number of options and exercise price adjusted accordingly.

274 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Financial Statements 10.
Share-based Payments continued Deferred Bonus As detailed within the Remuneration Report on pages 126 to 139, the maximum bonus payable under the Bonus Plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee is 300% of salary.
Bonuses are payable in three tranches as follows: the maximum bonus, which any one participant is eligible to receive in cash, will be limited to 100% of the individuals base salary: any additional bonus up to a further 100% of base salary will be deferred for a period of one year: and any remaining bonus will be deferred for a period of two years.
The deferred elements will take the form of awards of Xstrata shares conditional on the participant remaining in employment throughout the deferral period.
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date the bonus payment is determined.
The deferred elements have been treated as an equity-settled share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2.
In 2005 the Xstrata Remuneration Committee resolved that during the bonus deferral period dividend equivalents would accrue in relation to the deferral, to be delivered at the end of the deferral period and subject to the deferral award vesting.
As dividend equivalents are receivable on the deferred amounts, the fair value of the deferral is technically equal to the value of the bonuses deferred.
The total value of 2006 bonuses deferred was US$13 million 2005 US$7 million.
The number of deferred shares for the 2006 deferred bonus is 291,585 2005: 258,242.

The fair value of the 2005 equity-settled share-based payment under IFRS 2 was US$7 million, estimated at the 9 May 2005, using a Monte Carlo simulation model to incorporate the market based features of the plan.
The equivalent valuation of the 2006 award was US$7 million, estimated at 10 March 2006 using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
For the 2005 plan cycle, the market capitalisation on the 9 May 2005 was US$11.4 billion, the Participation Percentage was equal to 0.5% and the share price at the measurement date was US$18.00.

The other is a market capitalisation price index comprising the same 19 constituents.
2 When simulating the Xstrata Price Index, a dividend yield is included to account for the suppressing impact that a dividend payment has on the constituent share prices.
For the simulation of Xstrata's TSR and the Index TSR a dividend yield is not required.
There is no disclosure of the number of equity instruments granted as the AVP is not an award over a fixed number of shares.
Share-based Payments continued Directors Glencore Option As part of a package to attract him to take the position of chief executive of Xstrata AG in October 2001, Glencore International AG Glencore awarded Mick Davis an option over shares in Xstrata owned by Glencore, at an exercise price 46% higher than the share price on the day he joined and exercisable after three years from 19 September 2005 until 19 September 2011.
