Earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the revised nominal share values which have been applied since 22 May 2006 and which resulted in a one-to-one equivalence of ordinary shares of NV and PLC as regards their economic interest in the Group.
For further information please refer to note 22 on page 109.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share are based on: i conversion into PLC ordinary shares of the shares in a group company which are convertible in the year 2038, as described in Corporate governance on page 42: ii conversion of the 0.05 NV preference shares, details of which are set out below and in note 22 on page 109: iii the effect of share-based compensation plans, details of which are set out in note 29 on pages 117 to 121: and iv the forward equity contract described in note 29 on page 121.
On 15 February 2005, Unilever converted its 0.05 NV preference shares into ordinary 0.51 NV shares.
The conversion was made using shares already held by Unilever for the purposes of satisfying the Groups share-based compensation plans.
Unilever bought further ordinary shares in the market during 2005 to the extent required to restore the hedging position.
Until the date of conversion, the 0.05 preference shares were potentially dilutive for the purposes of the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share, as shown below.
At midnight on 13 July 2005 the 0.05 NV preference shares were cancelled.
