ii The expected dividend yield input for the grant of Performance Restricted Share Plan options in 2006 is zero as participants are entitled to additional shares to the value of the dividends paid during the vesting period.
iii The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
Where insufficient share price data was available, competitor share price volatility data over a longer period equal to the expected life of the option or share award was considered.
iv The expected term of the options is taken to be the midpoint between vesting and lapse, except for the Performance Restricted Share Plan where the terms of the plan result in it being advantageous for participants to exercise directly after vesting.
In this case the expected life has been assumed to equate to the vesting period.
For the Executive Share Option Plan, which has a significant exercise period, historic exercise patterns have been considered.
The fair value of the Share Incentive Plan shares is equal to the share price on the date of grant as there is no option price to be paid and employees are entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
Hence the assumptions set out above are not relevant to this scheme.

Pensions Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HM Revenue & Customs approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members affected by the earnings cap.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
In the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2006, the Group paid regular contributions to the pension plans of 11m in respect of the defined benefit arrangements and additional contributions of 20m.
In 2005, the regular contributions were 12m and additional contributions were 30m.
Employer contribution rates to the defined benefit arrangements for the 52 weeks ending 29 September 2007 are 16.5% for the MABPP and 34.0% for the MABEPP.
It has also been agreed that further additional contributions of 60m will be paid over the next two years, of which 10m relates to the agreement reached at the time of the last full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2004.
Total contributions of 50m are expected to be paid in the 52 weeks ending 29 September 2007 in respect of defined benefit schemes.
The Group paid 1m 2005 1m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The valuations used for IAS 19 purposes are based on the results of the full actuarial valuations carried out at 31 March 2004 updated by the independent qualified actuaries to 30 September 2006.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 30 September 2006 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the defined benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.

The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 6.3% at 30 September 2006.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the year was 10.8%.
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2006 2005 Long-term Long-term rates rates of return of return expected Value expected Value % m % m Equities 7.5 596 7.5 562 Bonds 4.6 488 4.6 428 Property 7.5 98 7.5 88 Fair value of assets 1,182 1,078 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,281 1,229 Deficit in the schemes recognised as a liability in the balance sheet 99 151 Associated deferred tax asset 32 50 The following amounts relating to the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Group income statement and Group statement of recognised income and expense: 2006 2005 Group income statement m m Operating profit: Current service cost defined benefit plans 14 12 Current service cost defined contribution plans 1 1 Past service cost 1 Charge to operating profit 15 14 Finance income: Expected return on pension scheme assets 69 62 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 61 59 Net finance income in respect of pensions 8 3 Total charge 7 11 56 Report Mitchells & Butlers Annual report and accounts 2006 | 7.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 26 September 2004.

This did not qualify for recognition in the financial statements at 30 September 2006 as it had not been approved by the shareholders at that date.
A special interim dividend for the 52 weeks ending 29 September 2007 of 1 per ordinary share was paid to shareholders on 25 October 2006 at a total cost of 486m.
In connection with the Special Dividend, a share consolidation was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17 October 2006 and then implemented on 18 October 2006.
The share consolidation resulted in the issue of 13 34 new ordinary shares of 8 24p each for every 41 existing ordinary shares.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit for the financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items see note 8 in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

All amortisation charges have been expensed through operating costs.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill relates entirely to the German business, which is also the non-UK reportable segment.
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount for this business is based on value in use.
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on current year data.
Cash flows beyond the current year have been extrapolated using a steady 1.5% growth rate which does not exceed the long-term estimated inflation rate for the German market.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding revenue and discount rates.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The post-tax discount rate used to calculate value in use is 6% 2005 6%.
This discount rate is derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the effects of taxation and for specific risks relating to the German business.
Revenue growth is assumed to be in line with inflation of 1.5% and profit margins are based on current levels.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to changes in assumptions in respect of revenues.
However, management believes that the current assumptions used are reasonable.
Impairment reviews were performed on 26 September 2004, 1 October 2005 and 30 September 2006 by comparing the carrying value of the business to which goodwill relates with the recoverable amount.
Management determined that there has been no impairment.

Property, plant and equipment continued Properties Properties comprising land, buildings and certain fixtures, fittings and equipment, are included above at cost, less depreciation as required.
The most recent valuation of properties reflected in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment was undertaken in 1999 and covered all properties then owned by the Group other than leasehold properties having an unexpired term of 50 years or less.
This valuation was undertaken by external chartered surveyors, Chesterton plc, in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The basis of valuation was predominantly existing use value and had regard to trading potential.
The deemed cost carrying value of the Groups property, plant and equipment reflects the 1999 revaluation which at 30 September 2006 amounted to 328m 2005 335m.
In addition, in 1996, a group restructuring by Six Continents resulted in the transfer at book value of certain property, plant and equipment to a subsidiary that subsequently became part of the Mitchells & Butlers group.
The book value included the effect of revaluations undertaken prior to 1996.
Accordingly, the deemed cost carrying value of the Groups property, plant and equipment reflects those revaluations, which at 30 September 2006 amounted to 374m 2005 386m.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 3,273m 2005 3,299m, which are pledged as security for the securitised debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
Additions On 21 July 2006 the Group acquired 239 pub restaurant sites from Whitbread PLC for consideration of 497m plus acquisition costs of 10m, totalling 507m.
The fair value of the sites acquired has been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and is included within property, plant and equipment additions of 684m above.
The Group is unable to provide details of the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment acquired, prior to its acquisition, as the vendor has not provided access to this information.
Total fair value m Total consideration including acquisition costs 507 Comprising: Property, plant and equipment acquired 504 Stock and cash 3 507 Turnover of 34m and operating profit of 6m in respect of these pub restaurant sites is included within the income statement, for the period since acquisition.
The Group does not possess sufficient information relating to the revenue and profit of the acquired sites to disclose the combined revenue and profit for the Mitchells & Butlers Group and the sites, as if they were owned from the beginning of the financial period.
Finance leases The net book value of fixtures, fittings and equipment includes 2m 2005 4m in respect of assets held under finance leases.
The assets are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities.
Net book value The split of the net book value of land and buildings is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Freehold 2,799 2,461 Leasehold: unexpired term of more than 50 years 222 178 unexpired term of 50 years or less 149 138 3,170 2,777 In addition to the above, premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are classified in the balance sheet as prepayments of rentals under the leases.

Securitised debt On 13 November 2003, a group company, Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc, issued 1,900m of secured loan notes in connection with the securitisation of the majority of the Groups UK pubs and restaurants business owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited.
The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of 1,243m, pay issue costs of 23m and return 501m to shareholders by way of a special dividend.
On 15 September 2006 Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc completed the issue of 655m of further secured loan notes in the form of the A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes as detailed below.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation in November 2003.
The funds raised were mainly used to return 486m to shareholders by way of a special dividend and to provide long-term funding for the Whitbread pub restaurant sites acquired.
As part of the issue, the original A1 and A3 loan note tranches were repaid and reissued as A1N and A3N loan notes to take advantage of market rates.
Repayment of principal in respect of securitised debt The Class A3 notes were issued in principal amount of $418.75m.
The Class A3N notes were subsequently issued as a replacement for the A3 notes in principal amount of $418.75m.
These notes are fully hedged using currency swaps and interest rate swaps, whereby all principal and interest liabilities are swapped into sterling, providing an initial principal of 250m and fixed interest payable.
The Repayment of principal in respect of securitised debt in the cash flow statement of 460m, includes 223m which represents the sterling equivalent of the $418.75m A3 loan note repaid, translated at the spot rate on the date of the repayment 15 September 2006.

Borrowings continued The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies.
At 30 September 2006, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had cash and cash equivalents of 73m 2005 119m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 8m 2005 16m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in a secured account restricted cash.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.
The carrying value of the loan notes in the Group balance sheet at 30 September 2006 is analysed as follows: 2006 2005 m m Principal outstanding at beginning of period 1,824 1,854 Further loan note issue 1,078 Principal repaid during the period 460 35 Exchange on translation of dollar loan notes 13 5 Principal outstanding at end of period 2,429 1,824 Deferred issue costs 21 20 Accrued interest 5 4 Carrying value at end of period 2,413 1,808 At 30 September 2006 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities Group 2006 2005 Undrawn committed borrowing facilities m m Unutilised facilities expire: Within one year 295 220 Between two and five years 300 60 595 280 20.
Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the discussion of Treasury policies on pages 12 and 15 in the Operating and financial review.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
The primary treasury objectives of the Group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
Financial risk management The main risks which impact the Group result from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage these risks and are described below.
Interest rate risk The Group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivatives.
The Group minimises the volatility in financial statements through the adoption of hedge accounting provisions where appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Groups foreign exchange exposure primarily results from the issue of US$418.75m of Class A3 A3N floating rate notes which form part of the securitised debt see note 19.
At issuance of the notes the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and the interest elements of the notes.
After taking into account these hedging arrangements, the Group does not have a material profit and loss account exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
In addition, the Group is predominantly UK based and therefore does not have a significant currency exposure from its operations.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow hedging At 30 September 2006, the Group held 10 2005 2 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 1,105m 2005 450m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 1,105m 2005 450m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N 2005 A1, A3N 2005 A3, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8938% 2005 5.1805%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
At 30 September 2006 the Group held 1 2005 1 cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 250m 2005 250m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of 250m 2005 250m of the Groups A3N 2005 A3 floating rate $418.75m borrowings.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a fixed rate, in sterling, of 5.4445% 2005 5.6795%.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised directly in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges have been assessed as being highly effective during the financial period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
The interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at a fair value liability of 62m 2005 48m.
During the period a loss of 22m 2005 28m loss on cash flow hedges was recognised directly in equity.
A loss of 16m 2005 3m loss was removed from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.

The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or book values approximate to fair values.
