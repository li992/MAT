These are calculated as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Profit from operations 53,947 47,837 Add: Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 3,562 3,297 a Operating profit adjusted 57,509 51,134 Profit before tax 55,012 40,702 Profit loss on fair value movements on derivatives 3,659 3,436 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 3,562 3,297 b Headline profit before tax 54,915 47,435 Cash generated by operations see note 24 66,414 64,499 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 4,759 7,311 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 34 100 Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 4,676 2,909 Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares 513 596 c Operating cash flow adjusted 56,500 53,783 a Operating profit at in the table above has been shown before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, which relates to acquired intellectual property, customer relationships and profit in acquired order book.
Under UK GAAP this charge would have formed part of the amortisation of goodwill, which was also excluded from headline operating profit.
Since the remainder of goodwill is no longer amortised, this charge has been excluded for b consistency.
Headline profit before tax as shown at in the above table and adjusted earnings per share see note 10 are also presented before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition.
IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance b sheet dates.
Ultra is therefore stating headline profit before tax in the above table and adjusted earnings per share see note 10 before changes in the valuation of these instruments so that the underlying operating performance of the Group can more clearly be seen.
The Group is cash generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses c operating cash flow adjusted, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure in property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an understatement of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Intellectual property 10 years Customer relationships 10 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 55 Notes to accounts Group continued 11 Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 DF Group 35,375 35,375 Radamec 5,267 5,267 SML 5,495 5,473 UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc. 14,172 14,172 Tactical Communication Systems 19,305 19,305 DNE Technologies 14,106 16,012 Ocean Systems 5,321 5,321 Other comprising several CGUs 17,235 14,452 116,276 115,377 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of nil per cent.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8.2%.
An impairment review of goodwill at 31 December 2006 has been performed and the Directors consider that no adjustment is required.
a Acquisitions during the year In aggregate, consideration of 8,008,000 was paid in respect of acquisitions, all of which was discharged by means of cash and cash equivalents.
Aggregate assets and liabilities acquired comprised intangible assets of 3,770,000, property, plant and equipment of 106,000, cash of 209,000, inventories of 299,000, receivables of 875,000 and current liabilities of 871,000.
Polyflex Aerospace Limited On 11 January 2006 the Group purchased all of the share capital of Polyflex Aerospace Limited, a business based in Cheltenham, England, for a cash consideration before expenses of 4.3 million.
This represents the fair value of the consideration payable.
The aggregate net assets acquired and their provisional fair values, based on the Directors initial assessment of net realisable value, were as follows: Book value Revaluations Fair value 000 000 000 Intangible assets - 2,752 2,752 Property, plant and equipment 123 56 67 Current assets: Cash at bank 209 - 209 Inventories 229 - 229 Receivables 467 - 467 Current liabilities 508 - 508 Net assets acquired 520 2,696 3,216 Goodwill arising on acquisition 1,200 Purchase consideration, including acquisition costs 4,416 Polyflex contributed a loss after tax of 95,000 in the period from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2006 after incurring a charge of 505,000 arising on the amortisation of intangibles attributable to the acquisition.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies deriving from the combination of businesses.
56 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 11 Intangible assets continued Winfrith Safety Systems On 28 July 2006, the Group, through a subsidiary, purchased the trade and assets of Winfrith Safety Systems for a cash consideration of 2.3 million, with a possible further 0.8 million of deferred consideration dependent upon the receipt of certain specified orders and future operational performance.
The aggregate net assets acquired and their provisional fair values, based on the Directors initial assessment of net realisable value, were as follows: Book value Revaluations Fair value 000 000 000 Intangible assets - 1,018 1,018 Property, plant and equipment 39 - 39 Current assets: Inventories 70 - 70 Receivables 408 - 408 Current liabilities 163 200 363 Net assets acquired 354 818 1,172 Goodwill arising on acquisition 2,112 Purchase consideration, including acquisition costs 3,284 Winfrith contributed a profit after tax of 3,000 in the period from date of acquisition to 31 December 2006 after incurring a charge of 174,000 arising on the amortisation of intangibles attributable to the acquisition.
If the above acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been 378.5 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been 39.9 million.
b Revisions to provisional fair values Audiopack Technologies Inc. Fair values on acquisition have been adjusted for Audiopack Technologies Inc. which was purchased in July 2005.
The revisions in value relate primarily to the write down of fixed assets that have no future value.
These additional fair value adjustments have resulted in an increase to goodwill at acquisition.
The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases was 56,000 2005: 92,000.

The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

During 2005, the Group renewed its banking facilities that are provided by a small syndicate of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
This facility, which provides up to 120 million of revolving credit over a five year period, is denominated in Sterling, US dollars and Canadian dollars and is used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 10 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest is charged at 0.375% 2005: 0.375% over base rate.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had available 87,002,000 2005: 45,292,000 of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
These undrawn facilities all expire within four years 2005: within five years.
19 Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Currency risk The Group utilises currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be an asset of approximately 2,491,000 2005: liability of 1,168,000, comprising 4,105,000 assets 2005: 663,000 included in trade and other receivables and 1,614,000 liabilities 2005: 1,831,000 included in trade and other payables.
The gain on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 3,659,000 2005: loss of 3,436,000.
The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales purchase contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.
The associated foreign currency translation risk is hedged by external borrowings in US and Canadian dollars.
The value of the borrowings do not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
60 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 19 Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate risk During the year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps will mature over the next two years and have fixed swap rates ranging from 4.175 per cent to 4.815 per cent.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR and Canadian dollar LIBOR.
The nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps are US$30 million 2005: US$40 million and CAD$30 million 2005: CAD$30 million.
The interest rate swaps are designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value has been charged to equity.
At 31 December 2006, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was assets of 54,000 2005: liability of 144,000, comprising 67,000 of assets 2005: nil included in trade and other receivables and 13,000 of liabilities 2005: 144,000 included in trade and other payables.
