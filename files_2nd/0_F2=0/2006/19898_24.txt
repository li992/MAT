Investment property and investment property under development are carried at fair value.
Property under development of 12.093m held in current assets is carried at cost, but its fair value has been determined as described below.
Following the formation of the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund it is likely that the fund will acquire the Groups future developments.
Hence properties acquired with the intention of selling them to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund following completion are now treated as property under development in current assets, carried at the lower of cost and NRV, rather than fixed assets, carried at fair value.
The impact if these properties were carried at fair value rather than cost is as follows: 2006 Investment Property Investment property under under property developement development Total 000 000 000 000 Balance at end of year 656,969 124,980 12,093 794,042 Valuation gain not recognised on property held at cost - - 2,214 2,214 Fair value at end of year 656,969 124,980 14,307 796,256 Included within investment properties and investment properties under development are the following values in respect of leasehold interests: 2006 Investment Property Investment property under under property developement development Total 000 000 000 000 Valuation and net book value Long leasehold 71,940 22,032 - 93,972 Short leasehold 13,078 - - 13,078 85,018 22,032 - 107,050 52 Notes to the financial statements 7.

Financial Instruments The Group holds or issues financial instruments for two main purposes: To finance the development and subsequent long term retention of investment properties: To manage the interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments such as trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments arise directly from the Groups operations.
The majority of financial instruments are of sterling denominations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments or derivatives.
The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and fresh issues of equity.
The Group borrows from bond holders and major banking institutions at both fixed and floating rates of interest, using derivatives where appropriate to generate the desired effective interest rate basis.
The derivatives used for this purpose are interest rate swaps.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and market price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed by using interest rate swaps and in some cases, simple fixed rate borrowing.
The Groups policy is separated into three areas: i Development finance The majority of the Groups development borrowing at 31 December 2006 is held at floating rate reflecting the Groups view of the stability of the current interest rate environment and the relatively low cost of adverse interest rate fluctuations in the context of the total development cost.
The Group continues to review the appropriateness of this policy on a regular basis.
ii Refinancing risk The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates, which affect the quantum of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups capital recycling strategy.
The Group manages this risk via a programme of pre-hedging, through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2006 approximately 51.7m 2005: 13.9m of the Groups anticipated refinancing was hedged for an average term of 3 years 2005: 4 years.
iii Medium and long term finance The Group holds its medium and long term bank finance under floating rate arrangements.
The majority of this debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2006, the Groups policy has been to hedge in excess of 70% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 2-20 years.
The Groups bond issuance attracts a fixed rate of interest over an average life of 15.1 years.
At 31 December 2006, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 72% 2005: 98% of the Groups medium and long term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
This is fixed at an average rate of 6.69% 2005: 6.62% over an average unexpired term of 8 years 2005: 11 years.

Financial Instruments continued Liquidity risk With respect to its development activities, the directors have adopted a policy whereby the Group injects the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt under associated facilities.
In this way, the funding requirements of each scheme are substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
Some of the Groups medium term banking facilities are fully revolving, allowing the Group to apply its cash surpluses in the temporary reduction of its debt obligations.
Market price risk The Groups primary market price risk is interest rate exposure.
It monitors this exposure through a process of sensitivity analysis, estimating the effect on operating cash flow over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2006, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.74m.
Effective and ineffective interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk, provided the effects of the various potential changes in rates remain within certain prescribed parameters.
Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis In respect of income earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.
The Groups overall average cost of debt as at 31 December 2006 is 6.7% 2005:6.5%.
