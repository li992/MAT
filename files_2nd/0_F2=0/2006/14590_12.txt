Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options.
The key features of share option contracts are described in Note 28 to these accounts.

The most significant elements of the groups total consolidated goodwill of 207.4m at 31 December 2006 are allocated to PANalytical 78m, BTG 44.1m, HBM 33.3m and Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration 20.1m.
Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
There have been no indications of impairment in 2006.
As part of the annual impairment test review, the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit based on the most recent budgets.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based relate to growth rates and discount rates.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budgets do not exceed 2.5%.
The cash flow projections have been discounted based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital, estimated at 12%.
No impairment charge has been recognised in 2006 in order to write down goodwill to its estimated recoverable amount 2005: 7.4m.

Secured bank loans Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the groups subsidiaries.
Of these 1.5m is denominated in Chinese Renminbi and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, 0.7m is denominated in US dollars and is repayable by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and 0.5m is denominated in Euros and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin.
Unsecured loan notes In 1996 the group issued US$100m of loan notes repayable on 15 July 2006 at par.
The loan notes bore interest at an average rate of 7.72%, which was fixed until redemption.
In 1996 the group entered into treasury locks to underwrite the interest rate at which the loan notes were issued.
This produced net proceeds of US$1.4m.
These proceeds were amortised over the period of the loan notes in the income statement.
After taking these proceeds into account, the average net rate of interest on the loan notes was 7.5%.
These notes were repaid in full on 15 July 2006.
In September 2000 the group issued US$75m of loan notes repayable on 13 September 2010 at par.
The interest rate on these notes is 8.23%.
On issue, the group entered into cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements which have the effect of converting the US$ borrowings into fixed interest Euro-denominated debt.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in Euro debt of 80.4m with a fixed interest rate of 6.89%.
The cross-currency interest rate swap was cancelled on 15 July 2006.
The interest rate is fixed at 8.23% until redemption of the loan notes.
In October 2003 the group issued 25m of loan notes repayable on 15 October 2013.
The interest rate on these notes is 5.56% and remains fixed until redemption.
In October 2003 the group issued US$100m of loan notes repayable on 15 October 2013.
The interest rate on these notes is 6.08%.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in Euro debt of 90.5m with a fixed interest rate of 5.64%.
The interest rate remains fixed until redemption.
Interest is paid six-monthly in arrears on all loan notes.
Under adopted IFRS, where cross-currency interest rate swaps are used, the value of the underlying US$ borrowing is presented in this borrowings note and the value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps is presented separately within derivative financial instruments in Note 21.
For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts US$ borrowings into Euro borrowings is viewed as part of the groups net debt, as analysed below.

These contracts are recorded at each balance sheet date at their fair value on the balance sheet.
Assuming the hedge is effective, any change in the fair value of the forward exchange contracts is recognised in the hedging reserve in equity until the point at which the hedged transaction occurs, at which time any amount recognised in the hedging reserve is recycled through the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2006 is an asset of 1.3m 2005: liability of 0.6m of which 1.2m has been credited to the hedging reserve 2005: debit of 0.5m and 0.1m credited to the income statement 2005: debit of 0.1m.
These contracts mature over periods not exceeding 12 months.

Cross-currency interest rate swaps As described in Note 20, the group has taken out cross-currency interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed interest US$ borrowings into fixed interest Euro borrowings.
These synthetic Euro borrowings act as a natural hedge of the net assets of the groups European businesses.
The value of the groups cross-currency interest rate swaps can effectively be split into two components: a portion that is attributable to converting a US$-denominated borrowing liability into a Euro-denominated borrowing liability the currency portion the value of this portion changes as currency exchange rates change and a portion that is attributable to converting fixed rate US$ interest payments into fixed rate Euro interest payments the interest portion the value of this portion of the swap changes as US$ variable interest rates, Euro variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates change.
Under adopted IFRS, the underlying US$ borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the cross-currency interest rate swaps.
In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised in full on the balance sheet.
60 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2006 SPECTRIS 24-76 15 3 07 22:57 Page 61 21 Derivative financial instruments continued At 31 December 2006, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swap is a liability of 12.8m 2005: 24.7m.
As explained in Note 20, the reduction in value is primarily attributable to the cancellation of one instrument during the year.
The table below shows the movements on the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swap during the year and also how it is attributed to its currency and interest portions.
Currency Interest Total portion portion value Fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap m m m As at 1 January 2005 29.9 7.6 37.5 Change in fair value recognised in reserves 13.9 13.9 Change in fair value recognised in income statement 1.1 1.1 As at 31 December 2005 16.0 8.7 24.7 Cash settled on cancellation of swap in July 2006 14.5 2.9 17.4 Change in fair value recognised in reserves 8.3 8.3 Change in fair value recognised in income statement 2.8 2.8 As at 31 December 2006 9.8 3.0 12.8 The combination of the underlying US$ borrowings and cross-currency interest rate swap has been designated as a net investment hedge of the groups net investment in its European businesses.
However, the interest portion of the swap is ineffective in this hedging relationship.
Accordingly, the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the change in value of the underlying US$ borrowings in reserves, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is recognised in the income statement within financing costs.
The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The key terms of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are set out below.

Provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where the effect is significant, generally only where it is anticipated that a liability will crystallise in more than one year.
Reorganisation Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business and represent the directors best estimate of the cost to complete the restructuring.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the groups standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the occasional extension up to 36 months.
The provision represents the directors best estimate of the groups liability based on past experience.
Other provisions represent the directors best estimate of settling various potential claims against the group arising in the ordinary course of business.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of ongoing negotiations.
Other The company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provision is made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations, but is expected to be within one to three years.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully.

The retained earnings reserve includes own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust see Note 29.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.

Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
Share options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are also subject to performance criteria, being the fulfilment of earnings growth targets.
Options vest after a period of three years, and have a maximum term of ten years.
Under the Performance Share Plan, the exercise price is the nominal cost of the companys shares.
Awards are subject to performance criteria, 50% of the award being based on fulfilment of earnings growth targets and 50% subject to a total shareholder return target.
Awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the twelve-month period following vesting.
Under the Save As You Earn scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date, and exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under the Save As You Earn scheme.

The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
