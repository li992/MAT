No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings as the parent company ultimately controls the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, as such, is able to control the timing of the reversal of any associated temporary differences.
The Company has determined that either the overseas profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit overseas earnings of subsidiaries, it is not expected that such distributions will give rise to a tax liability.
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 95.8m 2005: 100.4m as it is not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be set.

Sharesave Scheme 2001 Sharesave Scheme The Sharesave Scheme, approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting, is approved by HM Revenue & Customs in the UK and is open to all UK employees, including the UK based executive directors, who have completed at least three months of continuous service.
It is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 250 per month over a period of either three or five years.
Under the Sharesave Scheme options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing on the day immediately preceding the date of invitation to apply for the option.
Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted.
Sharesave Scheme 1991 1991 Sharesave Scheme The 1991 Sharesave Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 1991 Annual General Meeting and operated on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme as summarised above.
The 1991 Sharesave Scheme has now expired and all outstanding options were exercised during 2006. International Sharesave Plan The International Sharesave Plan was introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme by shareholders.
It operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme save that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to a370 per month or equivalent in other currencies over a period of three years and options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing five days before the date of invitation to apply for the option.
Irish Sharesave Plan The Irish Sharesave Plan was also introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme by shareholders.
It is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to a320 per month over a period of three years and options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing five days before the date of invitation to apply for the option.
1994 Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 Scheme The 1994 Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 1994 Annual General Meeting.
No further options have been granted under the 1994 Scheme since it expired in May 2004.
A performance condition, based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years, has to be satisfied before options may normally be exercised.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and replaces the 1994 Scheme.
The LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A allows the Board to grant share options.
In normal circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Share options granted to date have a performance condition attached based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years.
Part B of the LTIP allows the Board to award performance shares which is a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
A performance share award will normally vest i. e. become exercisable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
The extent to which performance share awards granted to date will vest will be subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period relative to the TSR performance of a specified peer group of companies.
Further details of the share schemes and plans operated by the Company are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Options granted during the year have been valued using a binomial model.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2006 2005 Grant date 6.03.064.10.06 1.03.051.11.05 Share price at grant date 6.566.87 5.005.69 Exercise price nil6.83 nil5.69 Options granted during the year shares 4,021,596 4,301,156 Vesting period years 35 35 Expected volatility % 1723 2224 Option life years 310 310 Expected life years 3.05.5 3.03.9 Risk free rate of return % 4.34.9 4.14.7 Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield % 2.32.5 2.63.0 Fair value per option 0.612.50 0.721.95 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three to five years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The weighted average share price for options exercised over the year was 6.64 2005: 5.35.
The total charge for the year for continuing operations relating to employee share based payments was 3.0m 2005: 3.6m, all of which related to equity settled share based payments.
After deferred tax the total charge for continuing operations was 5.1m 2005: 1.7m.
