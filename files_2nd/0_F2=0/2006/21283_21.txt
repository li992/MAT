36 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial information for the year ended 31 October 2006 has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee IFRIC approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union and have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice the SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in December 2005 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis consistent with the recommendations of the SORP.
b First time adoption of IFRS The date of transition to IFRS for the Group is 1 November 2004.
The IFRS accounting policies set out herein have been applied retrospectively to the opening balance sheet as at 1 November 2004 and all subsequent periods.
The disclosures required by First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in notes 25 and 26. c Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and of its wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, The Army and Navy Investment Company Limited.
The intra-group balances are eliminated on consolidation.
d Investments held at fair value through profit or loss All investments are designated upon initial recognition, and subsequently, are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Assets are fide-recognised at the trade date of the disposal.
Proceeds will be measured at fair value, which will be regarded as the proceeds of sale less any transaction costs.
The fair value of the financial instruments is based on their quoted bid price at the balance sheet date, without deduction of the estimated future selling costs.
Unquoted investments are valued by the directors using primary valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, recent transactions and net assets.
Where fair value cannot reliably be measured the investment will be carried at the previous reporting date value unless there is evidence that the investment has since been impaired, in which case the value will be reduced.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Also included within this caption are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments, including the difference between the purchase price of an investment and its bid price at the date of purchase.
In its financial statements the Company recognises its investments in its subsidiary at fair value.
e Presentation of Consolidated Income Statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Income Statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 266 of the Companies Act 1985, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2006 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued f Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Special dividends are treated as revenue return or as capital return, depending on the facts of each individual case.
Income from fixed interest debt securities is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
The trading profits of the subsidiary undertaking, which represent realised gains and losses on the sale of current asset investments, are dealt with in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Income Statement as a revenue item.
Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
g Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
On the basis of the Boards estimate of the long term split of total income in the form of capital and revenue return of 70% and 30% respectively, the Company charges 70% of its finance costs and investment management fee to capital return.
All administration expenses are charged to the revenue column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are charged to the capital column of the Consolidated Income Statement and allocated to other capital reserves.
Purchase and sale transaction costs for the year ended 31 October 2006 were 317,000 and 285,000 respectively 2005: transaction costs of purchases 277,000: transaction costs of sales 140,000.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reflecting the fact that they are attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
h Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Consolidated Income Statement is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Income Statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
38 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
i Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are not recognised until approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
j Foreign currency For the purposes of the consolidated accounts, the results and financial position of each entity is expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency of the Group.
Sterling is the functional currency because it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
l Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

The Company has not provided for deferred tax on capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments as it is exempt from tax on these items because of its status as an investment trust company.
d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 3,422,000 2005: 2,784,000 arising as a result of Eligible Unrelieved Foreign Tax EUFT and loan relationship deficits.
These expenses will only be utilised if the Group has profits chargeable to corporation tax in the future.

17 Financial instruments i Management of risk The Groups financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and fixed interest securities that are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives as set out on the inside cover of the report and accounts: Debenture stock, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations: Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups operations: and Derivative transactions which the Group enters into comprising futures and traded options, the purpose of which is to manage market price risks arising from the Groups investment activities.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
As last year, these policies have remained constant throughout the year under review.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and stock selection are other factors which act to reduce market risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly to consider investment strategy.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through its debenture stocks and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and the Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
46 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the Accounts continued 17 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Groups assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out below.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of short term borrowing and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
The Company expects to place any deposits on a short term basis only.
The Company lends securities from its UK portfolio, within limits set by the Board.
It receives collateral to cover the securities lent.
This collateral is subject to concentration limits, to a margin and to regular revaluation.
Foreign currency risk The Groups total return and net assets can be significantly affected by currency translation movements as some of the Groups assets and revenue are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The fund manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments.
Borrowings in foreign currencies will be limited to levels appropriate to the asset exposure to these currencies.
ii Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The majority of the Groups financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a stated maturity date.

It also has uncommitted overdraft facilities of 10,000,000 2005: 10,000,000.
The facilities are subject to regular review by the providers.
