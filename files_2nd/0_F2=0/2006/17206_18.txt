The overall expected rate of return of 6.47% is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the Schemes investment portfolio, net of investment management expenses.
The assets of the Scheme are currently held in the following proportions: equities 58%, corporate bonds 26%, government bonds 12% and other 4%.

The Group schemes provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares for a short period immediately prior to the date of grant.
The number and weighted average exercise price of all share options extant under the Executive and Sharesave Schemes are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average Weighted average exercise price exercise price Options pence Options pence Outstanding at beginning of period 8,963,742 224 6,559,514 178 Granted during the period 3,229,581 334 4,334,354 268 Lapsed during the period 328,372 226 371,924 158 Exercised during the period 1,072,724 203 1,558,202 166 Outstanding at the end of the period 10,792,227 259 8,963,742 224 Exercisable at the end of the period 1,249,216 190 1,680,070 190 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 324p 2005: 252p.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2006 had a range of exercise prices of 152p to 335p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of seven years.
On transition to Adopted IFRS, the grants of options since 7 November 2002 are required to be accounted for under IFRS 2 Share-based payments, which requires the fair value of services received in return for share options granted to be recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.
The fair value of these services is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted which is estimated using a Binomial pricing model.
The 10- year contractual life of the options and the expectation of early exercise are incorporated into the model.
The other key inputs used in the model for options granted in the current and prior-year are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average price at grant date 334p 269p Expected volatility 27.0% 27.0% Expected life 5 years 4 years Risk free rate 4.35% 4.40% Expected dividend yield 5.00% 5.00% Expected volatility was determined wholly by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the period since demerger in May 2001.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1.7m and 0.4m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2006 and 2005 respectively.
At the year end liabilities of 0.4m 2005: 0.1m were included in the balance sheet for these items.
Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Financial instruments Financial risk management and treasury policies The Group has a centralised treasury function which operates under Board-approved treasury policies and guidelines, covering funding, management of foreign exchange exposure, and interest rate risk.
All transactions entered into by the Wincanton treasury function are required to be in support of, or as a consequence of, underlying commercial transactions.
Liquidity risk The Group has financed its growth in recent years through retained profit and bank loans.
The Groups policy on funding capacity is to ensure that there is always sufficient long-term funding in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
The Groups committed banking facilities were increased during the year from 200m to 210m.
Margin reductions were negotiated, and the maturity of the facilities was extended to 2010.
During 2005 the funding platform was also broadened and the average maturity of debt extended by raising US$ 150m in the US private placement market on 7- and 10- year floating rate terms.
The funds have been swapped into euros at floating rates, and have been used to refinance bank facilities, and to position the Company to take advantage of the opportunities for continued growth.
Interest rate risk The Group maintains a policy of using derivatives to achieve the appropriate balance between fixed, capped, and floating interest profiles, so as to limit the exposure to the cash cost of servicing our debt.
The Group has carefully considered the impact of IAS 39.
The majority of the Groups drawn debt at 31 March is in floating rate euros, derived from the fixed rate US$ private placement.
IAS 39 does not permit hedge accounting treatment of interest rate swaps to manage such exposure.
We have therefore allowed our existing swaps to mature, and limited our exposure to increases in euro interest rates by purchasing an interest rate cap.
Currency risk As a Pan-European business a proportion of the Groups activities are denominated in currencies other than sterling, principally the euro.
However, the transactional exposure of the Group is minimised as the vast majority of transactions are denominated in the relevant functional currency of the operation concerned.
In order to protect the sterling value of the balance sheet, the Group has financed its investment in overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in euros.
Although a proportion of this funding is obtained by borrowing directly from the Groups committed facilities, a large element as noted above results from swapping the US$150m private placement into sterling, and then into euros.
The underlying US$150m principal and all future cash flows are fully hedged: the fair values of the US$ principal, and the US$ sterling swap move in line with each other, so there is no resulting significant adjustment to the Groups income statement.
As part of the sterling euro swap is used for the Groups net investment hedge, where changes in fair value are taken to reserves to offset the movement in the Groups euro denominated foreign investments, the currency risk of this instrument is minimised.
The Group makes use of foreign currency swaps to manage certain of its short-term trading currency requirements.
However, as at the year end, there were no such foreign currency swaps outstanding 2005: Nil.
The fair values of foreign currency swaps are recognised as derivatives and included within non-trade receivables and or payables as applicable, see table below.
Credit risk The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Deposits are only made with pre-approved counterparties.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit.
The Group does not generally require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet.
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
Effective interest rates and re-pricing analysis In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities the following table sets out the effective interest rates at 31 March and the periods in which they re-price.

For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and unsecured bond issues Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows at market interest rates.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogenous lease agreements.
Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Financial instruments continued Transition to IFRS Wincanton has taken advantage of the exemptions under IFRS 1 on transition to Adopted IFRS and therefore the following UK GAAP disclosures are required in respect of 2005, which are based on those included in the 2005 Annual report although certain of the values have been changed due to the transition, specifically the recognition of a property finance lease and the reclassification of jointly owned entities.
Interest rate and currency of funding After taking into account the various interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts entered into by the Group, the effective interest rate and currency of funding exposures of Wincantons net debt position at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2005 m Sterling Bank loans and overdrafts 22.2 Fixed rate finance leases 4.0 Cash deposits held by the Groups captive insurer 33.5 Cash at bank and in hand 0.6 Euro Bank loans and overdrafts 89.8 Fixed rate finance leases 2.4 Cash at bank and in hand 20.8 Other Cash at bank and in hand 7.0 Net debt position 56.5 From March 2003 to March 2006 the Company maintained a number of three-year interest rate swap arrangements to fix the interest rate liability of approximately two-thirds of both the sterling and the euro denominated debt.
The floating bank loans and overdrafts bear interest at short-term inter-bank rates principally applicable to periods of three months or less and bank base rates.
The interest rate risk profile of the Group as at 31 March 2005 was as follows: 2005 Floating Fixed Total m m m Sterling Bank loans and overdrafts 7.8 30.0 22.2 Finance leases 4.0 4.0 Euro Bank loans and overdrafts 39.3 50.5 89.8 Finance leases 2.4 2.4 31.5 86.9 118.4 The fixed rate liabilities noted above have the following weighted average interest rates and periods to maturity: 2005 Weighted average Average remaining interest rate % duration in months Sterling Bank loans and overdrafts 4.7 11 Finance leases 9.8 356 Euro Bank loans and overdrafts 2.8 11 Finance leases 5.8 78 Cash at bank and in hand and the cash deposits held by the Groups captive insurer earn interest based on the applicable local inter-bank rate.
Currency analysis As a Pan-European business a proportion of the Groups activities are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
However, the transactional exposure of the Group is minimised as the transactions of each operation are denominated in the relevant functional foreign currency.
At the 2005 year-end there were no material transactional balances that were denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency.
The Groups exposure to structural foreign exchange movements is minimised by matching non-sterling assets with non-sterling liabilities.
Any gains or losses arising on the non-sterling investments and associated non-sterling borrowings are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Fair values of financial instruments Financial instruments comprise overdrafts, medium-term loans and finance leases.
Short-term debtors and creditors are excluded.
As at the 2005 year-end, there were no foreign currency swaps outstanding.
The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities, including foreign currency swaps, is not materially different from the book value, except for the interest rate swap transactions entered into in March 2003.
At 31 March 2005 the fair value of these, being the market values of the instruments, is given in the fair value table on page 57.

30 Accounting estimates and judgements Management discusses with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The areas where policy selection is most critical for the Group are concerned with the accounting for pensions, share based payments, and the testing of goodwill for impairment.
Information about the assumptions and risk factors relating to these issues are given in notes 26, 27 and 9 respectively.
31 Explanation of transition to Adopted IFRS As stated in note 1, these are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing first the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006, secondly the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and lastly an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounts previously United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
In November 2005 the Group published an IFRS Transition Statement to explain how the transition from UK GAAP to Adopted IFRS has affected the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows and to set out the changes to the accounting policies of the Group and provide reconciliations of the restatement of previously published comparative financial information.
This statement is required to be reproduced in these Group financial statements in respect of the comparative year ended 31 March 2005 and in respect of the opening balance sheet at the transition date 1 April 2004.
Overview of impact of adoption of IFRS Conversion to Adopted IFRS affects Wincantons reporting particularly in respect of certain jointly owned entities, pensions, share based payments, leases and dividends.
It does not affect the cash flows or the underlying prospects of the business: however, the implementation of the new standards may result in increased volatility in reported results due to changes in the accounting for pensions and share based payments.
A group restructuring has been completed to ensure the Group has an appropriate level of distributable reserves following the transition to Adopted IFRS.

Jointly owned entities Under UK GAAP Wincanton fully consolidated the results and balance sheets The impact of these changes has been to decrease net assets in the transition of those entities in which it has an equal share of equity as it exercised balance sheet by 0.4m and in the year ended 31 March 2005 to increase dominant influence over those entities but had no power of control.

The final dividend of 8.3m for the year ended 31 March 2004 was declared in June 2004 and consequently this has been reversed in the transition balance Wincanton has elected to apply the exemptions under IFRS 1 neither to sheet and charged through the statement of changes in equity in the half year restate any pre transition business combinations under IFRS 3 nor to identify ended 30 September 2004.

Previously under UK GAAP The impact of the transition to Adopted IFRS in respect of business Wincanton deferred certain contract execution costs arising under certain combinations is summarised as follows: operations and amortised these against future revenue flows.
Under Adopted IFRS these costs will now be expensed but an applicable amount of revenue the value of goodwill reported under UK GAAP at 1 April 2004 is frozen: will be recognised at the commencement of the contract and the accrued revenue unwound over the subsequent contract term.
the goodwill amortisation charge of 2.0m in the year ended 31 March 2005 under UK GAAP has been reversed: As a result of the above all contracts have been reviewed and those identified where first the future revenue stream does not meet the recognition a value of intangibles of 3.5m has been recognised on acquisitions since requirements of IAS 18 and secondly which have costs of contract execution 1 April 2004 and reclassified from goodwill previously recognised: and deferred on the balance sheet.
As a result, the net assets at transition have been reduced by 1.3m of these costs.
The impact on the results for the year a charge for amortisation of acquired intangibles of 0.1m has been made ended 31 March 2005 is immaterial.
Cash flows Provisions None of the IFRS adjustments relevant to Wincanton relate to cash and Adopted IFRS requires provisions expected to be settled within one year of therefore there is no impact on cash flows.
