During the year, an amount of 9m was reclassified from other investments.
Cash flow on finance leases includes an interest element of 3m 2005 3m, 2004 3m included within interest paid in cash flows from operating activities.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease came into effect from 1 January 2006 and provides guidance on whether a complex arrangement includes a lease.
As a result of this requirement certain arrangements have required reclassification as leases.
This has resulted in additional assets of 15m being recognised on the balance sheet offset by the recognition of associated finance lease creditors of 19m, which are included within net debt.
As a consequence, net debt at 1 January 2004 has been restated from 1,326m to 1,345m.
