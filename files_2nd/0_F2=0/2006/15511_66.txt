The profit of the Company for the financial year amounted to 58 million 2005: 69 million loss.
On 21 May 2003, the High Court approved a reduction of share capital and share premium accounts.
These balances were credited to retained earnings.
The High Court determined that any surplus over the deficit at 31 March 2003 was to be held as a non-distributable reserve, which would be transferred to retained earnings as incurred or when all creditors, as at the effective date of 22 May 2003, have been satisfied.
On 11 October 2005, the High Court released the Company from its obligation to retain this non-distributable reserve.
This release became effective when the Company placed 20 million in an escrow account held with Lloyds TSB plc to cover any future potential claims from creditors existing at 22 May 2003.
The amount outstanding as at 31 March 2006 was 16 million.
The monies in the escrow account will be solely for the protection of creditors of the Company which were in existence at 22 May 2003, which were not schemed and which remain outstanding.
The balance remaining on this reserve was transferred to retained earnings during the year.
