7 Share-based payments The Group has a number of share-based payment plans for employees.
These comprise an Executive Incentive Plan awarded to the Groups senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP awarded to key senior employees, a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme that is made available to the majority of employees and a US s423 option scheme that is offered to all permanent employees in the US operating company.
The LTIOP and SAYE schemes were in operation before 7 November 2002 in addition to a pre-existing Long Term Incentive Plan.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to grants made, under all these schemes, after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
Executive Incentive Plan EIP The EIP scheme is a one-off conditional award on 1 February 2006 of shares to the 12 most senior executives in the Group to be delivered following the financial year ending 31 March 2009.
The number of shares to be awarded is dependent on the performance of the Group during the year ending 31 March 2009 varying between 0 and 2,700,000.
Dividends are accrued during the life of the options.
450,000 of the options have a cash alternative settlement arrangement.
The fair value of the EIP options was calculated using a Black-Scholes model based on the assumptions below.

Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP The LTIOP schemes are awarded to key senior employees at a grant price equal to Groups share price.
The vesting conditions include a continuation of service, a minimum of three years, and the performance of the Groups shares against a comparator group.
The share price is tested against this group after three years and can be retested after four and five years if the options have not vested.
The proportion of the options vesting is also dependent on the comparative share performance.
The share options can be exercised up to 10 years after the grant date.
Any options remaining unexercised after 10 years from the date of grant will expire.
There are currently three LTIOP schemes.
5,264,667 options were granted on 30 June 2005, 4,959,435 options were granted on 30 June 2004 and 6,452,956 options were granted on 30 June 2003.
