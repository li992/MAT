6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 59 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies A summary of the significant accounting policies is set out below.
These have been applied consistently in the current and previous financial years.
Revenue Revenue recognised in the income statement represents amounts receivable in respect of contractual income, property rental income, other property and trading activity and interest income earned in the normal course of business, net of VAT and other sales-related taxes, as follows: Contractual revenue The Groups gross contractual revenue comprises income earned by its property outsourcing businesses, and rentals and service charges received from tenants.
Contracts entered into under the UK Governments Private Finance Initiative PFI scheme are unbundled, either at inception or on any reassessment of the arrangement.
Income from the embedded leases, principally contractual and third party rents, is distinguished from income from the other contract elements.
Amounts receivable under PFI contracts in respect of the provision of property to customers are treated in accordance with the provisions of IAS 17 Leases with the minimum lease payments being spread on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
However, the cost and revenue proles of the portion of the contract concerned with the provision of property related services are treated as arising from service contracts in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Revenues earned from property outsourcing businesses are subject to variation due to the exible occupational rights conferred by those contracts.
Income from service contracts where payment is received by a xed unitary charge is recognised and accounted for according to the stage reached in the contract by reference to the value of work completed.
Income from other service contracts is recognised and accounted for according to the stage reached in the contract by reference to the costs of work completed.
An appropriate estimate of the profit attributable to the work undertaken is recognised once the outcomes of contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
In addition to service charges, as part of certain property outsourcing contracts, the Group is also responsible for procuring certain additional goods and services supplied to its customers.
The direct costs of supplying these goods are invoiced to the Group and recharged to customers in full.
As the Group receives a pre-determined fee for managing such activity on behalf of its customers and the risks in relation to the provision of these goods and services are primarily borne by the Groups customers, revenue for this activity recorded by the Group comprises the net income earned by the Group from this activity in each financial reporting period.
Property trading income Income earned from property trading consists of proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Sales are recognised on completion of sale contracts.
Interest income Interest income is the interest earned on cash held in bank accounts and is recognised in the accounts on an accruals basis.
Rental income receivable under operating leases Rental income receivable under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except for contingent income which is recognised when it arises.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over the non-cancellable period of the lease, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Premiums received to amend or terminate leases are recognised in the income statement when they arise.
Rentals payable under operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the period to the first break, if shorter.
Incentives given by lessors to enter into lease agreements, including asset management receipts, are spread evenly over the shorter of the lease term or the period to the first break as a reduction of rental expense, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Premiums paid to amend or terminate leases are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Investment property Freehold property held to earn rent or for capital appreciation or both is classied as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property.
Property held under finance leases for similar purposes is also classied as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs, and thereafter is stated at fair value, which reects market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Property, plant and equipment Property Where the Group provides significant levels of ancillary services to the occupiers of its property, this property is not classied as investment property.
Such freehold property and property held under finance leases are revalued to fair value annually and depreciated in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.
Surpluses or deficits on individual properties are transferred to the revaluation reserve, except that deficits including impairment adjustments below historical cost are taken to the income statement.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve in equity except to the extent that it reverses a decrease in the carrying value of the same asset previously recognised in the income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the income statement.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent of any existing surplus in respect of that asset in the revaluation reserve.
Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 59 6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 60 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued A transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings for the difference between depreciation based on the carrying amount of the assets and that based on the assets original cost.
Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Upon disposal any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any additional provision for impairment which may be required.
Premiums on operating leases Premiums on operating leases are stated at cost less amortisation and any additional provision for impairment which may be required.
Depreciation and amortisation Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less the estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life.
Buildings are classied according to their condition and date of construction, and are depreciated over periods between 20 and 50 years according to this classication.
Buildings held under finance leases are depreciated over the terms of the leases if shorter Premiums paid for operating leases are amortised on a straight line basis over the remaining lease terms Plant and equipment, excluding information systems equipment, are depreciated over four years Information systems equipment, including computer equipment and telecommunications apparatus is depreciated over two to four years No depreciation charge is applied to land The useful economic life and residual values of all property, plant and equipment is reassessed annually.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until it is virtually certain that a contract will be awarded, from which time further pre-contract costs are recognised as an asset and charged as an expense over the life of the contract.
Amounts recovered in respect of costs that have been written off are deferred and amortised over the life of the contract.
Acquisitions of corporate interests in property Acquisitions of corporate interests in property are accounted for on consolidation as if the Group had acquired the underlying property directly.
Accordingly, no goodwill arises on such acquisitions.
Any difference between the fair values of the property and the acquisition consideration are allocated to the investment property asset, which is subject to subsequent revaluation to its market value under IAS 40 Investment Property.
Non-current assets held for sale Items of property, plant and equipment are transferred to non-current assets held for sale when it is expected that their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than from continuing use in the business in accordance with IFRS 5 Non current assets held for sale.
On re-classication any depreciation of the assets ceases even if the assets are still being used by the Group, and in the case of investment property each asset is carried at its fair value less cost of realisation and in the case ofother assets, each asset is carried at the lower of its previous carrying value and fair value less cost of realisation.
Any impairment adjustment below historical cost is charged to the income statement.
Long-term service contract balances Where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings on long-term service contracts other than those contracts for which the Group receives a xed unitary charge, the balance is shown as an asset within trade and other receivables.
Where progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses on long-term service contracts, the balance is shown as a liability within trade and other payables.
Finance leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a finance lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fullment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specic asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benets incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the income statement as they arise.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows of the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
60 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 61 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Inventories Trading property Property acquired and held with the intention of being sold, is included in inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the market value less expected costs of sale.
Work in progress The costs of service contracts not yet taken to the income statement, less any foreseeable losses and payments on account, are shown within inventories as work in progress.
Asset management receipts Asset management receipts, which represent premiums given by lessors in return for the Group extending its existing lease terms or removing break clauses from existing leases, are deferred and released as a credit to operating costs evenly over the shorter ofthe lease term and the first break, even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash and short-term deposits Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, short-term deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Derecognition of financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Provisions Provision is made in respect of costs incurred on vacant leasehold properties or for leasehold properties sublet at a level which renders a property loss-making over the length of the lease, being the net cash outow committed to be incurred over the lives of the leases.
The cash ows for each such lease are discounted back to the balance sheet date, representing the Groups best estimate of the impact of the time value of money and the risks inherent in its obligations.
Any increase or decrease in the provision is taken to the income statement each financial period.
The unwinding of the discount in the provision is charged to the income statement each year within finance costs.
The basis of the provision, the discount rate applied and amounts provided are reviewed semi-annually.
Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which shares are granted.
Fair value, in the case of shares issued at the date of the Companys IPO and the two further equity raises, is the offer price.
Fair value at all other dates is determined as the bid price quoted on the London Stock Exchange at the date of the grant.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the service conditions are fullled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modied, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modied.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modication, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modication.
Where an equity-settled award does not meet the vesting conditions, the expense recognised in the income statement is reversed, as if it had not vested, on the date of cancellation.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modication of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 61 6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 62 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Treasury shares Treasury shares represent those shares returned to the Company as a result of members withdrawing from the Employee Share Plan.
They are accounted for as a deduction from equity at their cost of acquisition.
Share premium Costs related to the issue of ordinary shares are charged against share premium.
Financial instruments Interest and non-interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transactions costs.
After initial recognition, interest and non-interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in finance income and finance expense respectively.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with interest rate uctuations.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date at which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Fair value for a swap is market value, as determined by a break cost quote prepared by an experienced, independent broker, which is estimated by applying current yields to anticipated future cash ows.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives with the characteristics of a hedge and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception and designated as a hedge.
This documentation identies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, interest rate swaps are designated as cash ow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement for the year.
For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in equity under net unrealised gains or losses.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the year.
Current taxation Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Company is a limited company registered in Guernsey, Channel Islands and is not subject to local taxation.
Certain Group undertakings are subject to foreign taxes in respect of foreign source income, including UK income tax on rental income.
Deferred taxation Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised 62 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 63 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a dened contribution pension scheme.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benets is the contributions payable for the year.
Differences between contributions payable for the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.3 significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the value at which certain assets and liabilities are held at the balance sheet date and also the amounts of revenue and expenditure recorded in the period.
The Directors believe the accounting policies chosen are appropriate to the circumstances and that the estimates, judgements and assumptions involved in its financial reporting are reasonable.
Accounting estimates made by Mapeleys Directors are based on historical experience and on information available to them at the time each estimate is made.
Accordingly, actual outcomes may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions and conditions.
The accounting policies that are subject to significant estimates and assumptions are set out below.
Property valuations Investment properties are accounted for in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property and are held at fair value.
Any surplus or deficit on revaluation is recognised in the Income Statement.
Under the relevant provisions of IFRS, the properties held under the HMRC portfolio are considered to be property, plant and equipment because of the significant levels of facilities management services provided on them.
These properties are revalued at each balance sheet date.
For both the investment properties and property, plant and equipment, the annual valuations are based upon estimates and subjective judgements that may vary from the actual values and sales prices that may be realised by the Group upon ultimate disposal.
The critical assumptions made relating to valuations have been disclosed in notes 10 and 11 to the financial statements.
Rental income Rental income receivable under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except where income is contingent in which case it is recognised as it arises.
The Groups outsourcing contracts with Abbey and HMRC are subject to annual uplifts in rental income.
Receipts from HMRC are considered contingent as they are subject to annual uplifts related to RPI and uncertainty of income due to the vacation rights that exist within the HMRC contract.
On the Abbey contract the considerable exibility of occupation conferred by Abbeys vacation rights also makes contract revenue contingent.
Operating lease incentives The Group treats any incentives for tenants to enter into lease agreements as a reduction to revenue and accounts for rental income from the commencement of any rent free period.
The net rental income is spread evenly over the shorter of the period to the first break of the lease and the lease term.
Similarly the Group treats any incentives given by landlords on the Groups leasehold properties as an offset to the rental cost and accounts for such rental reductions from the commencement date of any rent free periods over the shorter of the period to the first break of the lease and the lease term.
The net rental incentive is spread evenly over the shorter of the period to the first break of the lease or lease expiry.
This straight-lining of rent may cause rental income or expense to be recognised in a manner that does not conform to rental receipts or payments.
As at 31 December 2006, accrued rent payable of 2.6 million 2005: 2.0 million and accrued rent receivable of 6.5 million 2005: 7.3 million was included within Trade and other payables and Trade and other receivables respectively.
Onerous lease provision Provision is made in respect of costs incurred on vacant leasehold properties or for leasehold properties sublet to tenants at a level of rent that would cause the properties to realise losses over the remaining terms of leases as set out in note 19.
The annual projections of cash ows for onerous leases are based upon estimates and subjective judgements and they may vary from the actual costs incurred on such onerous leases.
These estimates are driven from the Groups core business management systems and property databases which reect the Directors best expectations of the likely outcome of each property at any point in time.
The forecast cash ows are discounted to the annual discount rate at a rate estimated to reect the Groups time value of money.
Long-term service contracts The Group receives regular income under its outsourcing contracts, however its life cycle activity does not arise in such a regular manner.
Accordingly, certain costs incurred under the service contract element of outsourcing contracts are deferred and classied as work in progress.
The amounts deferred are estimates from the Groups financial forecasting models and expectations of future occupancy which reect the Directors best expectations of the likely outcome under these contracts at any point in time.
In respect of other service contracts profit is recognised over the course of the contract according to the stage reached in the contract.
An appropriate estimate of the profit attributable to the work undertaken is recognised once the outcomes of the contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The estimate of profit attributable to the contract is based upon the Directors best expectations of costs to be incurred.

These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The segments are described below: Outsourcing Contracts This segment consists of activities arising from the purchase and subsequent leaseback of the HMRC and Abbey property portfolios and the t-out and delivery of serviced accommodation under the IPS contract.
The main characteristics of these arrangements are listed below: Long-term contracts the contracts run over periods from three to 20 years Agreements are tailored in accordance with the clients accommodation requirements from simple purchase and lease back to fully serviced accommodation The HMRC and Abbey agreements allow them to exercise exibility to vacate properties within dened parameters Under the HMRC and Abbey agreements the revenue earned is subject to annual increases Direct Property Investments The segment previously known as Investment property has been renamed Direct Property Investments.
The Group has embarked on a separate strategy of acquiring individual and portfolios of ofce property.
The Groups activities within this segment will focus on purchasing property primarily let to strong credit quality tenants, who are likely to stay in the properties for a minimum term of five years.
The Group has a single geographical segment, being the UK commercial property market.

On the Groups admission to the Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange on 21 June 2005, 291,308 ordinary shares were granted and issued in the names of Plan members subject to certain vesting conditions.
A further 13,059 new shares were granted and issued on 17 March 2006.
Vesting takes place over periods of up to 5 years from the date of issue and is conditional on employees remaining in employment: there are no performance conditions.
During the vesting period, the participants receive dividends and the shares may be sold, but the proceeds of any sale are subject to the same vesting terms as the shares.
Two further awards of 2,173 shares and 45,740 shares were granted on 8 May 2006 and 14 December 2006 respectively and were issued out of shares that had been returned to the Company as a result of members withdrawing from the Plan.
Following these issues, 698 shares remained having been returned to the Company 2005: 1,460 shares.
The total cost to the Group of shares issued under the Plan of 8.8 million 2005: 6.7 million is to be spread over the relevant vesting periods: 30% will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant and the remaining 40% will vest on the last business day before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
Non-Executive Director share benefit expense During 2005 four Non-Executive Directors were each awarded 15,000 ordinary shares.

These valuations have been incorporated into the annual financial statements.
Savills have consented to the use of their name in these financial statements.
The total of this valuation at 31 December 2006 was 560.1 million 2005: 566.6 million and an analysis of where the assets valued are recorded in the financial statements is shown in the table below: 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 m m Freehold property 479.2 487.3 Property acquired under finance leases 41.7 37.6 Recorded in property, plant and equipment 520.9 524.9 Properties held within premiums on operating leases 39.2 38.6 Properties held as non-current assets held for sale 3.1 Total valuation of the Groups assets valued by Savills 560.1 566.6 Long leasehold properties with a valuation of 39.2 million 2005: 38.6 million are classied as premiums on operating leases and are recorded at historical cost less amortisation see note 12.
During the year no properties were reclassied as non current assets held for sale 2005: 3.1 million.
The valuations at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 have been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards published in February 2003 the Red Book and the CESR Guidance on property valuations.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is dened as follows: The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were specic to the Group: For the purpose of the valuations, each property has been valued individually and not as part of a portfolio notwithstanding the overriding terms of the Group's contract with HMRC and the non-assignable nature of this contract.
The valuations assume that the contract is freely assignable in the open market No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation nor for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a property.
The valuations are, however, net of acquisition costs if any Purchasers' costs have been deducted in arriving at the valuations.
These are based on 1% agents fees, 0.5% legal fees fees include VAT at 17.5% and stamp duty land tax at the relevant rate, dependent upon the value of each property Under the terms of the contract with HMRC, it is entitled to bring a proportion of its leases to an end earlier than the 20-year term and vacate the premises subject to i 12 months' notice: and ii agreed limits on the amount and type of space that can be vacated each year.
The valuations assumed a hypothetical weighted average lease term for the leases with HMRC to reect these termination rights, and taking into account HMRC's stated intentions.
These hypothetical weighted average lease terms are as follows: Properties designated Core by the HMRC contract leased until 31 March 2021 Properties designated Intermediate by the HMRC contract leased until the contractual lease expiry date Properties designated Flexible by the HMRC contract leased until 30 September 2011 HMRC pays the Group amounts under the contract which cover the charge both for the accommodation provided and the related services.
The payment is subject to deductions for failures to meet specified performance standards and unavailability for use.
Services provided to HMRC include maintenance, life cycle replacement, cleaning, help desk, security, catering, childcare, health and safety, utilities, equipment management, churn, vending and landscaping.
The valuations rely upon the Group for its assessment of the cost of providing these services, the level of deductions and how they will vary over time The valuations have been carried out by taking account of the benefit of the contract with HMRC and the various occupational leases and the subsequent sale of the property at expiry of these arrangements.
In assessing the future sales proceeds, Savills have estimated the current vacant possession value of the properties and assumed that these decline in real terms at rates between 0.5% and 1.25% per annum.
In order to arrive at their valuation, Savills discounted net annual rents receivable at a weighted average rate of 6.1% and residual sales values were discounted at a weighted average rate of 10.0% 70 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 71 10 Property, plant and equipment continued Certain other properties held under finance leases and included within property, plant and equipment were valued in accordance with the Red Book by the Directors at a Market Value of 2.2 million 2005: 2.4 million having taken advice from a suitably-qualied employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The valuations for the finance leases were determined by: Taking into account the estimated future income stream from each property Using appropriate discount rates that reect the incremental borrowing rate of the Group at the time the leases were taken out, being 9%.
2005: 9% If freehold property and property acquired under finance leases were measured using the historical cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: 2006 2005 m m Freehold Cost 189.8 190.8 Accumulated depreciation 3.5 3.2 Net book value 186.3 187.6 Acquired under finance leases Cost 23.7 23.7 Accumulated depreciation 2.4 2.3 Net book value 21.3 21.4 All leased assets are pledged as security for the related finance lease obligation.
As set out in note 18, freehold property and property acquired under finance leases have been secured against external borrowings.

Investment property was valued at 31 December 2006 by CB Richard Ellis Limited CBRE and Savills, valuers external to the Group.
Both Savills and CBRE have consented to the use of their names in these financial statements.
Investment property comprises the Groups Abbey portfolio and its direct property investments.
CBREs valuation of the Abbey portfolio of properties was 575.7 million 2005: 546.5 million.
Certain properties with a valuation of nil 2005: 1.8 million included within this valuation are being marketed for sale and as such are classied as trading properties within inventories.
They are carried at the lower of cost and fair value less costs of realisation see note 13.
In addition certain properties with a valuation of 3.0 million have been identied for sale within the next 12 months and have therefore been transferred to non-current assets held for sale.
Of this amount 2.5 million has been valued by the Directors and the remaining 0.5 million is included within the assets valued by CBRE.
These are carried at fair value less costs of realisation in the financial statements see note 13.
Savills and CBRE both carried out valuations of the Groups other properties held within investment property, which were valued at 53.1 million 2005: 24.8 million, and 850.6 million 2005: 504.4 million respectively as at 31 December 2006.
The remaining properties held under Property acquired under finance leases were valued by the Directors at a Market Value of 4.2 million 2005: 3.5 million, having taken advice from a suitably-qualied employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is set out in note 10.
The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were specic to the Group: No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation or for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a property.
The valuations are, however, net of acquisition costs if any Purchasers' costs have been deducted in arriving at our valuations.
These are based on 1% agents fees, 0.5% legal fees fees include VAT at 17.5% and stamp duty land tax at the relevant rate, dependent upon the value of each property The valuations have been undertaken assuming except as otherwise disclosed to us that in the case of the Abbey properties, each property is subject to a standard-form lease agreed between the Group and Abbey and that these leases commenced on 1 January 2001 without options to break on the part of either the tenant or the landlord.
There are overriding provisions for Abbey to terminate occupational leases earlier than the original lease end date.
These are set out within a master agreement entered into with Abbey.
In the case of the DPI properties, the valuation for each of the properties has been undertaken determined by the specic term of the individual leases Abbey's ability to exercise its right to end leases and vacate property early is constrained by the fact that the aggregate rent payable by Abbey in the following years of the master agreement's 20-year term cannot fall below the following percentages of the projected aggregate rents for those years: Years 5 to 6 95% Years 7 to 11 85% Years 12 to 15 80% Years 16 to 20 90% Constraints over the remaining investment properties are determined by the specic term of the individual leases In return for the exibility in the Abbey portfolio, there are compensation mechanisms provided within the master agreement which are intended broadly to leave the Group in a neutral position.
Whilst invariably the computation on a property by property basis may result in some properties being under compensated or vice versa, the valuations consider that overall the position is indeed likely to remain neutral It should also be noted that the rental increments broadly hold the rental ow at a similar level even on the presupposition that Abbey exercises maximum exibility The Directors valued certain finance leases at 31 December 2006, having taken advice from a suitably qualied employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, on the following basis: Taking into account the estimated future income stream from each property Using appropriate discount rates that reect the incremental borrowing rate of the Group at the time the leases were taken out, being 7.5% 72 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 73 12 Premiums on operating leases m Cost At 1 January 2005 57.7 Disposals 1.6 At 31 December 2005 56.1 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2005 15.3 Provided during the year 4.0 Disposals 1.6 At 31 December 2005 17.7 Net book value At 31 December 2005 38.4 At 31 December 2004 42.4 m Cost At 1 January 2006 56.1 Disposals At 31 December 2006 56.1 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2006 17.7 Provided during the year 3.2 Disposals At 31 December 2006 20.9 Net book value At 31 December 2006 35.2 At 31 December 2005 38.4 13 Non-current assets held for sale 2006 2005 m m At valuation At 1 January 2006 1.4 Reclassications from property, plant and equipment 1.7 Reclassications investment property 3.0 Disposals 1.4 Write down to lower of carrying and fair value 0.3 At 31 December 2006 3.0 1.4 As at 31 December 2006 the Group had decided to dispose of two investment properties.

In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 5, these properties have been transferred from investment properties and are held at the lower of carrying value and fair value less estimated costs of realisation.
Properties transferred in 2005 from Property, plant and equipment have been sold during 2006 see note 4.

All non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2006 had previously been recorded within investment property and carried at fair value.
All non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2005 had previously been recorded within property, plant and equipment: their carrying amount under the historical cost model as at that date would have been 1.0 million.

The restructuring of the Group during the prior year involved a share for share exchange, which introduced a new holding company, Mapeley Limited.
The relative rights of the former shareholders of MUKCO were not altered and this restructuring has been accounted for using the merger method of accounting.
Although Mapeley Limited was only formed on 26 April 2005 and acquired MUKCO on 2 June 2005, the accounting information on the Group has been prepared as if the Group had always been in existence in its current form.
At 31 December 2006, 698 shares 2005: 1,460 shares had been returned to the Group following withdrawal of members from the Plan.
These shares are held for the benefit of the Group under trust.
47,913 shares were issued to employees under the Employee Share Plan during the year out of shares that had been returned by Plan members leaving the Company prior to shares vesting.
Share premium Share premium represents the excess of proceeds raised on the issue of shares over the nominal value of those shares.

Contributed surplus and capital contribution The contributed surplus and capital contribution of MUKCO were reclassied as other reserves as part of the Group restructuring which occurred during the prior year.
This involved a share for share exchange with shareholders of MUKCO, which introduced a new holding company, Mapeley Limited.
The contributed surplus represented the excess of proceeds raised on the issue of shares over the nominal value of those shares.
During the prior year, 29.0 million of contributed surplus was repaid to the shareholders.
The capital contribution was an irrevocable offer to contribute capital on demand made by the shareholders of MUKCO in 2002.
This contribution was called and received during the prior year.
There have been no further movements in the current year.
Contributed surplus is available for distribution to the members of the Company provided that following any distribution the Company continues to have net assets and is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The capital contribution is available to be used for the purpose of providing additional funds in the event that obligations exceed available resources.
It is not available for distribution to the members.

Accruals and deferred income include an amount of 37.8 million 2005: 33.9 million in respect of deferred income.
22 Pension costs The Group operates a dened contribution pension scheme.
The pension charge for the year amounted to 0.3 million 2005: 0.2 million.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The Group does not operate any dened benefit schemes.
23 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group leases a number of commercial properties under operating leases.
Typically the leases provide for upwards-only rent reviews during the lease term and last 20 years from inception.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December analysed by the period in which they fall due are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Less than one year 163.1 162.5 Between one and five years 567.0 573.9 More than five years 705.9 776.6 1,436.0 1,513.0 Operating lease commitments Group as lessor The Groups portfolio of receivable operating leases comprises a block of leases purchased in December 2000, together with another block of leases, embedded within outsourcing contracts purchased in 2001 which also provide for the supply of other property-related services and some subsequent additions.
These leases are non-cancellable and have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years.
The Groups leases typically include a clause either to enable upward revision of the rental charge on an annual basis based on prevailing market conditions or a xed annual uplift of 3% or RPI and provide for the lessee to pay all insurance, maintenance and repair costs.
Future minimum rentals receivable under other non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December, analysed by the period in which they fall due are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Less than one year 157.1 135.5 Between one and five years 537.1 474.2 More than five years 763.9 828.2 1,458.1 1,437.9 Income from operating leases embedded in the Groups outsourcing contracts entered into under the UK Governments PFI scheme are not included in the above table.
Minimum payments cannot be established with certainty under the terms of the contract as the contract provides for exibility for the Government to relinquish space and consequently demand and revenue are uncertain.
Total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases in respect of properties acquired under finance leases at 31 December 2006 were 65.8 million 2005: 46.3 million.

Capital commitments 2006 2005 m m At 31 December, the Group had the following commitments: Contracted but not provided 18.1 0.4 The Company has committed to issue a further 5,000 shares to each independent Non-Executive Director still holding ofce at the conclusion of the second AGM following their dates of appointment.
24 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group's Property Portfolio.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has also entered into interest rate swap agreements in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements with its principal providers of finance.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group's sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 2.2.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Group's policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of xed and variable rate debt.
The Group's policy is to keep 100% of its long-term borrowings at xed rates of interest except for debt raised for direct property investment, where property acquired is initially funded on a short-term basis before being renanced through long-term borrowing facilities.
A target gearing ratio of up to 80% has been set for these long-term borrowings on direct property investments.
Mapeley also seeks to finance new outsourcing contracts in line with this strategy at up to 80% Loan To Value LTV.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps on the date an asset is purchased under which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between xed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount expected to be equivalent to the related long-term borrowings to be used to finance the asset on its renancing.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 31 December 2006, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, substantially all of the Groups non-current borrowings were at a xed rate of interest.
Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties.
It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verication procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debt is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, availablefor-sale financial assets and certain derivative instruments, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from any default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
A significant proportion of the Groups total income is earned from the Groups three contracts.
The contractual parties have either AAA or A credit ratings and no major credit risk is currently considered to exist.
Liquidity risk The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of its overdraft facility.
Short term exibility is achieved by a working capital facility of 25.0 million 2005: 55.0 million which is available until June 2007 with an option to extend for a further year.
In addition, at 31 December 2006, the Group had a 300.0 million 2005: 300.0 revolving acquisition facility of which 36.4 million 2005: 283.4 was drawn down.
In addition, the Group has drawn, long-term secured facilities totalling 1,241.7 million 2004: 803.2 million.
80 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 6818 Accounts 2006. qxd 16 3 07 17:33 Page 81 25 Financial instruments Certain of the Groups bank debts are subject to oating interest rates, the majority of which has been exchanged for xed interest rates under interest rate exchange agreements.
The Groups criteria for an interest rate swap are that the instrument must be related to an asset or a liability and that it must change the character of the interest rate by converting a oating rate to a xed rate or vice versa.
Interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value and shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
The fair value for a swap is market value, estimated using a break cost quote from an experienced, independent broker, which is estimated by applying current yields to anticipated future cash ows.
The key assumptions used in the swap valuations are listed below: The valuations represent the Net Present Value of the cash ows from the valuation date until expiry of the instrument at the contracted rate and at the valuation rate The valuation rate is compiled from prevailing market futures rates and swap rates on the date of the valuation Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Group's financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
The fair value of financial derivatives and borrowings has been calculated by discounting the future cash ows at prevailing market interest rates.

The other financial instruments of the Group not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Credit risk In the year ended 31 December 2006, 86% 2005: 86% of the Groups total turnover was derived from contractual payments made to the Group by Government Agencies i. e. HMRC and the Home Ofce, rated AAA by Standard & Poors and Abbey, rated A by Standard & Poors.
Except for these contracts, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

Under IFRS, these swaps cannot be designated as hedges for accounting purposes as the arrangements will not meet the hedge effectiveness criteria set out in IAS 39 until such time as the Groups short-term borrowings are renanced.

The shares were sold at book value.
However, the amounts have been subsequently written off as they are considered irrecoverable by the Companys Directors.
As a consequence, 599,000 was charged to the prior years income statement to write of amounts owing from Mapeley Milton Keynes Limited.
This is offset by a credit to the prior years income statement for 129,000 written-off owing to Willen Lake Limited.
Amounts owed by shareholders The Group has entered into an agreement to provide property management services in respect of 135 property interests owned by Pinnacle Towers Limited, a company in which Fortress Investment Group LLC held a significant interest.
In return for the provision of these services, the Group receives 100,000 per annum evenly spread across the year and receivable one month in arrears.

It provides investors with information regarding the Groups ability to service debt and make capital expenditure.
FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with IFRS, therefore it should not be considered an alternative to cash ow as a measure of liquidity, and is not necessarily indicative of cash funds available.
This calculation of FFO may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
The Group defines FFO as Group EBITDA less net finance costs less the movement in the onerous lease provision less the movement in work in progress plus the movement in net asset management receipts plus the charge in respect of employee shares plus realised revaluation gains.
This denition has been rened at 31 December 2006 but this has had no impact on reported FFO for 2005 or 2006.
More detailed denitions of these adjustments to EBITDA are given below: Net finance costs comprise finance costs less finance income as set out in the Group income statement, adjusted to exclude amortisation of loan finance fees, gains or losses on interest rate swaps, loan termination costs and the unwinding of discounts on provisions.
The Movement in the onerous lease provision This is the net release or charge to the Group income statement as a result ofthe change in the Group onerous lease provisions, excluding interest charged on the unwinding of the provision.
Although these amounts offset rental costs in the income statement, they do not represent cash movements and are therefore excluded from the computation of FFO.
The Movement in work in progress or the movement in long-term accrued costsThis is the year on year change in Group work in progress or if negative at the balance sheet date, accrued cost.
The amount represents the increase or decrease in life cycle costs deferred by the Group so as to match costs with revenue.
Net asset management receipts These are the total cash receipts in the year less amounts amortised in the financial period.
The accounting treatment of asset management receipts is set out in the accounting policies.
Employee shares Under IFRS 2, costs are charged to the Group income statement when share based payments are made.
This is a non cash expense and is therefore excluded from the measure.
Organic FFO is dened as the FFO contribution from property assets or services following the first anniversary of their acquisition or commencement of the contract, net of central overhead costs.
Acquisition FFO is dened as the FFO contribution from property assets or services in the first year of ownership in the case of property assets and contract commencement in the case of new services.
