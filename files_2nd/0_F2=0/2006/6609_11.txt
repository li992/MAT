Current tax expense has been reduced by a benefit of 5 million arising from previously unrecognised tax losses.
Deferred tax expense has been reduced by a benefit of 2 million arising from changes in tax rates.
The Group operates in countries where the tax rate differs from the UK tax rate.
The impact of these overseas taxes on the companys overall rate of tax is shown above.
Profits arising from certain operations in Singapore, Puerto Rico, Ireland and Belgium are accorded special status and are taxed at reduced rates compared with the normal rates of tax in these territories.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 7.2p in 2006, 2.7p in 2005 and 3.6p in 2004.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised intercompany profit arising on stock held by the Group at the year end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the stock is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the profit was originally made and the tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
The Group tax rate was decreased by 1.9% in 2006 2005 1.0% increase, 2004 0.3% increase as a result of increases in work-in-progress and finished goods.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GSK.
GSK Annual Report 2006 100 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Taxation continued As reported last year, GSKs largest unresolved tax issues were with the US Internal Revenue Service IRS and UK HM Revenue and Customs HMRC in respect of transfer prices related to the Glaxo heritage products.
On 11th September 2006, GSK and the IRS agreed to a resolution of their dispute.
Under the agreement, GSK has made gross payments to the IRS of approximately $3.3 billion.
The final net cash cost to the Group is approximately $3.1 billion, which covers federal, state and local taxes, interest and the benefit of tax relief on the payments made.
The settlement resolved all the transfer pricing issues in dispute for the period 1989 2000, which were due to go to trial in February 2007, and also covers the subsequent years 2001 2005.
GSK had previously made provision for the dispute and this settlement did not have any significant impact on the Groups reported earnings or tax rate for the year.
GSK continues to be in dispute with HMRC primarily in respect of transfer pricing and Controlled Foreign Companies legislation matters for the years 1994 to date and the parties are now preparing for litigation.
HMRC has not formally quantified its claims in respect of these matters but there continues to be a wide difference between the Group and HMRC positions on these matters.
GSK also has open issues in Japan and Canada, which were the subject of court proceedings in 2006.
In Japan the tax authorities are claiming approximately Yen 39 billion 169 million in respect of transactions in 1998.
GSK has paid the tax claimed, as required by law, and applied for a refund.
A court decision is expected in late March 2007.
A court decision in the Groups dispute with the Canadian Revenue Authority over the pricing of Zantac in the years 1989 to 1993 is expected in the first half of 2007.
GSK uses the best advice in determining its transfer pricing methodology and in seeking to manage transfer pricing and other taxation issues to a satisfactory conclusion and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities.
Except as shown in this Annual Report, no provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, on the grounds that no remittance of profit retained at 31st December 2006 is required in such a way that incremental tax will arise.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 26 billion.

Of these losses, 100 million 2005 64 million are due to expire between 20072013, 178 million 2005 184 million are due to expire between 20192027 and 70 million 2005 43 million are available indefinitely.
At 31st December 2006, the Group had not recognised any deferred tax asset in respect of income tax losses of approximately 3,742 million 2005 217 million, of which 131 million 2005 28 million are due to expire between 20072018, 21 million 2005 79 million are due to expire between 20192027 and 3,590 million 2005 110 million are available indefinitely.
Unrecognised losses have increased in 2006 due to quantification of previously uncertain amounts arising principally in 2003 and 2004.
The Group had capital losses at 31st December 2006 estimated to be in excess of 10 billion in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses.
All deferred taxation movements arise from the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
Other net temporary differences include accrued expenses and other provisions.
13 Earnings per share 2006 2005 2004 p pp Basic earnings per share 95.5 82.6 68.1 Diluted earnings per share 94.5 82.0 68.0 Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period after deducting shares held by the ESOP Trusts and treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met at the balance sheet date.

GSK normally pays a dividend two quarters after the quarter to which it relates and one quarter after it is declared.
The 2006 financial statements recognise those dividends paid in 2006, namely the third and fourth interim dividends for 2005 and the first and second interim dividends for 2006.

GSK Annual Report 2006 103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 15 Property, plant and equipment continued Included in land and buildings at 31st December 2006 are leased assets with a cost of 241 million 2005 165 million, accumulated amortisation of 95 million 2005 49 million and a net book value of 146 million 2005 116 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31st December 2006 are leased assets with a cost of 263 million 2005 153 million, accumulated amortisation of 97 million 2005 57 million and a net book value of 166 million at 1st January 2006 96 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
The value in use calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country specific risks.
These losses have been charged through cost of sales 125 million, R&D 22 million, and SG&A 8 million.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
The principal component of the 2006 reversals relates to the Montrose manufacturing facility, and all of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.

K. See Note 36 for further details.
The impairments in the year of 10 million relate to the Europharm business located in Romania, and were determined using the fair value less costs to sell model.
The carrying value of goodwill is made up of balances arising on acquisition of the following companies: 2006 2005 m m ID Biomedical Corporation 316 358 CNS, Inc. 112 Nippon Glaxo 134 143 Polfa Poznan S. A.
96 98 Corixa Corporation 25 28 Others 75 69 758 696 Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units which are tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using a value in use or a fair value less costs to sell model, depending on the nature of the unit.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, five-year post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated.
Initially a post-tax discount rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country specific risks, is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows.
Where this indicates that the recoverable value of the unit is close to or below its carrying value, the impairment test is reperformed using a pre-tax discount rate and pretax cash flows in order to determine if an impairment exists and to establish its magnitude.
Fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach, which in this case is based on the Groups acquisition valuation model.
The cash generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit is significant in comparison with the total goodwill balance are Vaccines, Consumer Healthcare, Japan and Poland.
Total goodwill of 362 million 2005 407 million, principally relating to the acquisitions of ID Biomedical and Corixa, is allocated to the Vaccines unit.
The recoverable value of this unit is determined using the fair value less costs to sell model.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the minority interest in Nippon Glaxo of 134 million 2005 143 million and on the acquisition of Polfa Poznan of 96 million 2005 98 million is allocated to the Japan and Poland cash generating units respectively.
The recoverable value of both these units is determined using the value in use model.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of CNS, Inc. in December 2006 is allocated to the Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a shortening of the brands lives is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology and using five year post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country-specic risks.
The main assumptions include future sales prices and volumes, product contribution, the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdiction and the products life.
These assumptions are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.

These principally arise from 50% interests in two joint ventures,  Holdings, L. P. which is developing specified chemical compounds, and GlaxoSmithKline Shire BioChem, which primarily co-markets Combivir, Trizivir and Epivir in certain territories, together with a 29% interest in another joint venture, Pharmaceutical Insurance Limited, which is a mutual insurance company covering pharmaceutical property risk.
In 2002, GSK hedged part of the equity value of its holding in Quest Diagnostics Inc. through a series of variable sale forward contracts.
The contracts the equity collar were renewed in 2006 and are structured in five series, each over two million Quest shares, and mature between 2010 and 2012.
The fair value of the contracts at 31st December 2006 was a liability of $24 million 2005 $24 million.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by reference to the current market value of similar instruments or by reference to the discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments, frequently in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Equity investments are recorded as non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets.
Non-current equity investments include listed investments of 348 million 2005 268 million that offer the Group the opportunity for return through dividend income and fair value gains.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from reserves to the income statement based on average cost.
The impairment losses recorded in the tables above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts recycled from the fair value reserve Note 32 on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

Provisions are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reect the final outcome and the amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of provision is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the provisions are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee, or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid dened benefit schemes also include dened contribution sections.
Contributions to dened benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries.
Pension costs of dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The long term, overall target asset allocation is 60% equities, 30% bonds and 10% property.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The UK discount rate is based on the iBoxx over 15 year AA index and the US discount rate is based on corporate bond yields which reect the term of the expected benefit payments.
The expected rate of return on bonds reects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
An equity risk premium of between 3% and 4% is added to longer term government bond yields to give the expected rate of return on equities.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long term predictions based on the yield gap between long term indexd mortality tables projected to 2006.
Plan linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are calculated using the PA92 standar obligations are then increased by between 3% and 10%, depending on each individual schemes mortality experience, to make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
GSK Annual Report 2006 109 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2026 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 25.3 26.8 24.3 26.1 Projected for 2026 26.9 28.6 25.8 27.0 These mortality assumptions were set following a review in December 2005.
GSK expects to review these again in December 2007.
During 2006, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK and US pension schemes totalling 346 million 2005 366 million.
In 2006, GSK formalised an agreement with the trustees of the UK dened benefit pension schemes to make additional contributions of up to 325 million per year in addition to the normal contributions, over a four-year period ending 31st December 2009 in order to eliminate the then pension deficits on an IAS 19 basis.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
The Group has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the dened benefit liabilities: UK USA Rest of World 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 4.25 4.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 3.25 3.25 3.25 Discount rate 5.00 4.75 5.25 5.75 5.50 5.75 4.25 3.75 4.25 Expected pension increases 3.00 2.75 2.50 n a n a n a 2.00 2.00 2.00 Cash balance credit conversion rate n a n a n a 4.75 4.50 4.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 Ination rate 3.00 2.75 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.50 1.75 1.75 1.75 The amounts recorded in the income statement and statement of recognised income and expense for the three years ended 31st December 2006 in relation to the dened benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were as follows: Post-retirement Pensions benets 2006 UK USA Rest of World Group Group m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 135 66 56 257 48 Past service cost 33 2 31 Expected return on pension scheme assets 333 142 30 505 Interest on scheme liabilities 307 113 42 462 57 Settlements and curtailments 17 2 4 11 14 159 35 62 256 91 Actuarial gains recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense 111 16910 290 139 Post-retirement Pensions benets 2005 UK USA Rest of World Group Group m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 117 63 52 232 46 Past service cost 1 Expected return on pension scheme assets 285 126 28 439 Interest on scheme liabilities 276 104 34 414 53 Settlements and curtailments 16 16 124 41 58 223 100 Actuarial losses recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense 490 109 93 692 102 GSK Annual Report 2006 110 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued Post-retirement Pensions benets 2004 UK USA Rest of World Group Group m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 117 58 42 217 37 Past service cost 2 2 Expected return on pension scheme assets 272 118 20 410 Interest on scheme liabilities 269 104 27 400 55 Settlements and curtailments 5 5 119 44 51 214 92 Actuarial gains losses recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense 162 26 26 162 54 The total actuarial losses recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense since 1st January 2003 amount to 689 million.

Implementation of the integration following the merger is substantially complete.
The exchange offer incentive programme operated at the time of the merger to encourage staff to convert Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham share options into GlaxoSmithKline share options.
The incentive is paid either when employees exercise the relevant options, or when the options lapse, up to 2010.
The discount on this provision increased by 2 million in 2006 2005 4 million, and was calculated using risk-free rates of return.
Costs recognised in the remaining merger integration provision in respect of identied severances are expected to be incurred in 2007.
Operational excellence is the term used by the Group to refer to the continuous worldwide programme of cost saving measures that are carried out within all areas of the business.
The majority of these projects are of a short-term nature.
GSK is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notication of possible claims, as set out in Note 43 Legal proceedings.
Provisions for legal and other disputes include amounts relating to US anti-trust, product liability, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental.
The companys Directors, having taken legal and other specialist advice, have established provisions after taking into account insurance and other agreements and having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements.
These provisions were discounted by 2 million in 2006 2005 71 million using risk-adjusted projected cash ows and risk-free rates of return.

A number of products have a history of claims made and settlements which makes it possible to use an IBNR incurred but not reported actuarial technique to determine a reasonable estimate of the Groups exposure for unasserted claims in relation to those products.
Apart from the IBNR provision, no provisions have been made for unasserted claims.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.
It is in the nature of the Groups business that a number of these matters, including those provided using the IBNR actuarial technique, may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over several years.
The largest individual amounts provided are expected to be settled within three years.
At 31st December 2006, it is expected that 120 million 2005 115 million of the provision made for legal and other disputes will be reimbursed by third party insurers.

40 Employee share schemes The Group operates share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at the grant price, savings-related share option schemes and share award schemes, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.
In 2004, the Group introduced a new share award scheme, the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to certain employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Options under the share option schemes are granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the Directors and, with effect from the 2004 grant, the CET are subject to performance criteria as laid out in the Remuneration Report.

The fair value of performance share plan grants take into account market conditions.
Expected lives of options were determined based on weighted average historic exercises of options.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at 31st December 2006 was 342 million.

intangible assets under US GAAP 8,643 10,182 The indefinite lived brands relate to a large number of Consumer Healthcare products, principally arising from the acquisitions of SmithKline Beecham plc including products previously acquired by SmithKline Beecham from Sterling Winthrop Inc. and the Block Drug Company, with book values as follows: 2006 2005 m m Panadol 683 730 Aquafresh 347 347 Lucozade 324 324 Horlicks 319 319 Ribena 309 309 Nicorette 292 292 Odol 228 228 Tums 226 226 Nicoderm 224 224 Sensodyne 216 225 Others 983 868 indefinite lived brands intangible assets under US GAAP 4,151 4,092 GSK Annual Report 2006 146 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 41 Reconciliation to US accounting principles continued Each of these brands is considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support.
The brands are in relatively stable and profitable market sectors, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of marketrelated factors causing a shortening of the brands lives is considered to be relatively low.
The carrying values of certain intangibles subject to amortisation were reviewed and an impairment of 6 million 2005 68 million has been recorded.
Of this, 6 million 2005 46 million relates to pharmaceutical products and nil 2005 22 million to Consumer Healthcare products.
An impairment charge in respect of Consumer Healthcare intangible assets not subject to amortisation of 35 million was recognised during 2006 2005 50 million.
As discussed in Note 43 Legal proceedings, a number of distributors of generic drugs have led applications to market generic versions of a number of the Groups products prior to the expiration of the Groups patents.
If generic versions of products are launched in future periods at earlier dates than the Group currently expects, impairments of the carrying value of the products may arise.
The estimated future amortisation expense for the next five years for intangible assets subject to amortisation as of 31st December 2006 is as follows: Year m 2007 1,424 2008 1,241 2009 865 2010 846 2011 815 Total 5,191 In-process R&D of 14 million 2005 26 million: 2004 nil arising on the acquisitions of CNS and Pliva in 2006 and ID Biomedical and Corixa in 2005 has been written off.
This has been valued on the same basis as the other intangible assets acquired and relates to various development projects in the pre-approval stage where the technological feasibility of the projects had not been established at the point of acquisition.
c Theravance In May 2004, the Group formed a strategic alliance with Theravance Inc. to develop and commercialise novel medicines across a variety of important therapeutic areas.
Under the terms of the alliance, Theravance received $129 million, a significant part of which related to the Groups purchase of Theravance shares.
The Group has a call option in 2007 to further increase its ownership to over 50% at a significant premium to the price paid in the 2004 transaction.
Theravances other shareholders have a put option at a lower exercise price to cause GlaxoSmithKline to acquire up to half of the outstanding stock in 2007.
The Group has an exclusive option to license potential new medicines from all of Theravances programmes until August 2007.
Upon exercising its option over a Theravance programme, the Group will be responsible for the relevant development, manufacturing and commercialisation activities.
Depending on the success of such programmes, Theravance will receive clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on the subsequent sales of medicines.
Based on the assessment performed in May 2004, the Group was the primary beneciary of Theravance, as dened by FIN 46R, and as a result Theravance was consolidated into the Groups US GAAP financial statements from that date.
The net assets acquired were measured at fair value.
The principal adjustment to the carrying value of the net assets in Theravances balance sheet prior to the acquisition was recognition of in-process research and development IPR&D at a valuation of 273 million.
The IPR&D was written off immediately after the acquisition in accordance with US GAAP purchase accounting.
In February 2006, Theravance completed a secondary offering of common stock, which is a reconsideration event as dened by FIN 46R.
The assessment at this date indicated that the Group is no longer the primary beneciary of Theravances variable interests.
Accordingly, Theravance has been fide-consolidated from the Groups results under US GAAP since February 2006.
Additionally, the Group previously accounted for the Theravance put option discussed above in accordance with SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which requires the Group to record the fair value of the put oup under FIN 46R in February 2006, the put option has been accounted option as a liability.
Since Theravance ceased to be a subsidiary of the Gr for in accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
This also requires the fair value of the put option to be recorded as a liability.
The fair value of the Theravance put option at 31st December 2006 is 10 million 2005 47 million.
In dance with SFAS 133, the call option is not recognised in the financial statements as it is not readily convertible into cash.

GSK Annual Report 2006 163 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 43 Legal proceedings continued These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous waste facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs.
In most instances, GSK is involved as an alleged generator of hazardous waste although there are a few sites where GSK is involved as a current or former operator of the facility.
Although Superfund provides that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for cleanup costs, these proceedings are frequently resolved on the basis of the nature and quantity of waste disposed of at the site by the generator.
GSKs proportionate liability for cleanup costs has been substantially determined for about 20 of the sites referred to above.
GSKs potential liability varies greatly from site to site.
While the cost of investigation, study and remediation at such sites could, over time, be substantial, GSK routinely accrues amounts related to its share of the liability for such matters.
Tax matters Pending tax matters are described in Note 12.
