This operation, which is expected to be sold within twelve months of the Balance Sheet date, has been classified as a disposal group.
The assets of the business are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, and the net result for the year presented within discontinuing operation in the Income Statement.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the carrying value of the related net assets and accordingly no further impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of these operations as held for sale.

Note 9 Earnings per share and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.

Tesco plc 61 Notes to the financial statements continued Note 10 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cashgenerating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on value in use, which is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated growth rates generally 3%-4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 9%-11% 2005 and 2004: 10%-13%.
This discount rate is derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region.
In February 2006, 2005 and 2004 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management determined that there has been no impairment.
The components of goodwill are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 m m m UK 466 463 414 Poland 331 323 252 Thailand 115 107 109 Japan 133 135 121 Turkey 55 49 43 South Korea 32 10 8 Other 57 10 1,137 1,094 957 62 Tesco plc Note 11 Property, plant and equipment Plant, equipment, fixtures and Land and fittings and buildings motor vehicles Total m m m Cost At 26 February 2005 14,247 4,298 18,545 Foreign currency translation 198 45 243 Additions a 1,935 707 2,642 Acquisitions through business combinations 20 3 23 Reclassification across categories 208 11 197 Classified as held for sale 74 15 89 Disposals 555 342 897 At 25 February 2006 15,563 4,707 20,270 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses At 26 February 2005 1,705 2,319 4,024 Foreign currency translation 91928 Charge for the year 250 503 753 Reclassification across categories 1 1 Classified as held for sale 5 6 11 Disposals 139 262 401 Impairment losses 40 7 47 Reversal of impairment losses 44 8 52 At 25 February 2006 1,815 2,573 4,388 Net carrying value b c d At 25 February 2006 13,748 2,134 15,882 At 26 February 2005 12,542 1,979 14,521 Capital work in progress included above e At 25 February 2006 699 82 781 a Includes 67m 2005 63m in respect of interest capitalised, principally relating to land and building assets.

Cash-generating units are tested for impairment if there are indications of impairment at the Balance Sheet date.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long term growth rates generally 3%-4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 9%-11% 2005 and 2004: 10%-13% depending on the specific conditions in which each store operates.
This discount rate is derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The Groups cash-generating units were reviewed for impairment on transition to IFRSs using the methodology and assumptions outlined above.
This review resulted in impairment losses of 142m as at 29 February 2004.
Due to movements in foreign exchange rates, the impairment losses increased to 152m as at 26 February 2005.
The following amounts have been charged credited to operating costs in the Income Statement during the current and prior year.
2006 2005 m m Impairment losses UK 29 Rest of Europe 18 Asia 47 Reversal of impairment losses UK 29 Rest of Europe 23 Asia 52 Net reversal of impairment losses 5 The impairment losses relate to stores whose recoverable amounts either value in use or fair value less costs to sell do not exceed the asset carrying values.
In all cases, impairment losses arose due to stores performing below budgeted trading levels.
The reversal of previous impairment losses arose principally due to improvements in stores performances over the last year and a reduction in the weighted average cost of capital, which increases the net present value of future cash flows.
In all cases, the impairment losses charged or reversed during the year have been measured relative to the value in use of the stores.

The fair value of swaps used for fair value hedging at the Balance Sheet date was a liability of 100m.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than that of the purchasing company.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars.
The cashflows hedged will occur within one year of the Balance Sheet date.
At the Balance Sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed was 548m.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated as effective cash flow hedges was an asset of 4m.
This amount has been deferred as a component of equity.
Net investment hedges The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency options to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of these instruments at the Balance Sheet date was a liability of 150m.
The Group has a Korean Won denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge on a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
The carrying value of the liability at the Balance Sheet date was 246m.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting The Group has a number of financial instruments which do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These instruments include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options, caps, collars and interest rate swaps.
The fair value of these instruments at the Balance Sheet date was a liability of 5m.

The average strike rate of the interest rate caps purchased was 6.76%, while the average strike rate of the interest rate floors sold was 2.98%.
The average maturity of the collars as at 26 February 2005 was two and a half years.
The value of these contracts as at 26 February 2005, if realised, would have resulted in a loss of 1.7m.
Sterling interest rate caps with an aggregate notional principal of 600m were purchased during the year ended 26 February 2005.
The strike rate on these caps was 6% and the average maturity was five years.
The value as at 26 February 2005 of these contracts, if realised, would have been 3.5m.
Retail Price Index funding of 226m, maturing in 2016, was outstanding as at 26 February 2005 and was classified as fixed rate debt.

Surplus funds as at 26 February 2005 were invested in accordance with approved limits on security and liquidity and bore rates of interest based on relevant LIBOR equivalents.
Cash at bank and in hand included non-interest bearing cash and cash in transit.
Currency exposures Within the Group, the principal differences on exchange arising, which are taken to the Income Statement, relate to purchases made by Group companies in currencies other than their reporting currencies.

The total Income Statement charge for the year recognised in respect of share-based payments is 190m 2005 173m which is made up of share option schemes and share bonus payments.
a Share option schemes The Company had eight share option schemes, all of which are equity-settled schemes, in operation during the year: i The savings-related share option scheme 1981 permits the grant to employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 250 per four-weekly period.
Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three or five-year period at a subscription price not less than 80% of the average of the middle-market quotations of an ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceeding the offer date.
ii The Irish savings-related share option scheme 2000 permits the grant to Irish employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 12 and 320 per four-weekly period.
iii The approved executive share option scheme 1994 was adopted on 17 October 1994.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the discretionary share option plan 2004.
There were no discounted options granted under this scheme.
iv The unapproved executive share option scheme 1996 was adopted on 7 June 1996.
This scheme was introduced following legislative changes which limited the number of options which could be granted under the previous scheme.
v The international executive share option scheme 1994 was adopted on 20 May 1994.
This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
vi The executive incentive plan 2004 was adopted on 4 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
vii The performance share plan 2004 was adopted on 4 July 2004.
Options are normally exercisable between four and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three-year period.
viii The discretionary share option plan 2004 was adopted on 4 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at a price not less than the middle market quotation or average middle market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing days preceeding the date of grant.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme.
The average share price during the year to 25 February 2006 was 317.79 pence 2005 277.87 pence.
The fair value of share options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following table gives the assumptions applied to the options granted in the respective periods shown.

The measure of volatility used in Tesco PLC option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board consider the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.
b Share bonus schemes Eligible UK employees are able to participate in Shares in Success, an all-employee profit sharing scheme.
Each year, shares are awarded as a percentage of earnings up to a statutory maximum of 3,000.
Senior management also participate in performance-related bonus schemes.
The amount paid to employees is based on a percentage of salary and is paid partly in cash and partly in shares.
Bonuses are awarded to eligible employees that have completed a required service period and depend on the achievement of corporate targets.
The Executive Directors participate in short-term and long-term bonus schemes designed to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Full details of these schemes can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The fair value of shares awarded under these schemes is their market value on the date of award.
Expected dividends are not incorporated into the fair value.

These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit plans.
The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit schemes for the Groups employees in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and South Korea.
Defined contribution plans The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 7m 2005 2m have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
Defined benefit plans United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2005.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was 153m.
The market value of the schemes assets represented 95% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The T&S Stores PLC Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme open to senior executives and certain other employees at the invitation of the company.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 1 April 2004.
Overseas The most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland.
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 25 February 2006.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values as at 25 February 2006.
Buck Consultants Ireland Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation.
The liabilities relating to post-retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19, and are incorporated in the following tables.
Tesco plc 81 Notes to the financial statements continued Note 23 Post-employment benefits continued Principal assumptions The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 25 February 2006.
The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, used by the actuaries were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 3.9 3.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.7 2.6 2.5 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.7 2.6 2.5 Rate of increase in career average benefits 2.7 2.6 2.5 Discount rate 4.8 5.4 5.7 Price inflation 2.7 2.6 2.5 The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, i. e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 110m and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by between 13m and 15m.
UK mortality assumptions Following analysis of the mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK, which was carried out as part of the formal valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2005, it was decided to alter the mortality assumptions used in the formal valuation.
The updated mortality tables as at 31 March 2005 were PMA92COO for male members and PFA92COO for female members.
This change has been carried through into the calculation of the pension liabilities in the Balance Sheet as at 25 February 2006 for the main UK fund.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the Balance Sheet date and a member reaching age 65 at the same date 25 years.

Post-employment benefits other than pensions The Company operates a scheme offering post-retirement healthcare benefits.
The cost of providing these benefits has been accounted for on a similar basis to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The liability as at 25 February 2006 of 10m 2005 8.5m, was determined in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
In 2005 06, 0.5m has been charged to the Income Statement and 0.7m of benefits were paid.
A change of 1.0% in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: 2006 m Effect on the annual service and interest cost 0.1 Effect on defined benefit obligations 1.0 Expected contributions The Group expects to make contributions of approximately 320m to defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas in the year ending 24 February 2007.

Contingent liabilities The Company has irrevocably guaranteed the liabilities as defined in section 5 c of the Republic of Ireland Amendment Act 1986, of various subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the Republic of Ireland.
Tesco Personal Finance, in which the Group owns a 50% joint venture share, has commitments, described in its own financial statements as at 31 December 2005, of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling 6.0bn 2005 5.2bn.
The amount is intended to provide an indication of the volume of business transacted and not of the underlying credit or other risks.
For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11.
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group.
In connection with the railway tunnel collapse at Gerrards Cross, the Group is currently assessing a number of potential claims.
Due to the nature of those claims it is not currently possible to assess their potential impact, therefore no provision has been made.
The final outcome is not expected to be material to the Group.

Share-based payment IFRS 2 a Share Option Schemes The main impact of IFRS 2 for the Group is the expensing of employees and Directors share options.
The expense is calculated with reference to the fair value of the award on the date of grant and is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting.
We have used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options on their grant date.
To ensure better comparability, the Group has applied IFRS 2 retrospectively to all options granted but not fully vested as at 29 February 2004, rather than just to those granted after 7 November 2002.
In 2004 05, application of IFRS 2 results in a pre-tax charge to the Income Statement of 48m: the pre-tax effect is partially offset by a deferred tax credit of 16m.
Deferred tax is calculated based on the difference between market price at the Balance Sheet date and the option exercise price.
As a result the tax effect will not correlate to the charge.
The excess of the deferred tax over the cumulative Income Statement charge at the tax rate is recognised in equity in 2004 05 this amounted to a credit of 9m to retained earnings.
The deferred tax assets recognised in February 2004 and February 2005 relating to the share option schemes are 25m and 49m, respectively.
b Share Bonus Schemes Under UK GAAP the Group expensed share bonus schemes by applying the rules of UITF 17.
Whereas the UK GAAP Profit and loss account charge was based on the intrinsic value of the award, the IFRS 2 charge is based on the fair value.
This results in an additional charge of 4m to the Income Statement in 2004 05.
As a result of IFRSs, deferred tax assets recognised under UK GAAP relating to share bonus schemes have reduced by approximately 8m at both the 2004 and 2005 Balance Sheet dates.
Goodwill arising on Business Combinations IFRS 3 Under IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised on a straight-line basis but instead is subject to annual impairment testing.
Consequently, the goodwill balances were reviewed for impairment at February 2004 and February 2005 and no impairment adjustments were identified.
In terms of adjustments to the Income Statement in 2004 05, the non-amortisation of goodwill results in an increase of pre-tax profit of 61m.
There are no associated tax impacts.
In the February 2005 Balance Sheet, a foreign exchange gain of 2m has been recognised through reserves relating to the non-amortisation of goodwill: therefore, the total adjustment to net assets relating to goodwill amounts to 63m.
Recognition of dividends IAS 10 Under IFRSs dividends declared after the Balance Sheet date are not recognised as a liability as at that Balance Sheet date.
The final dividend of 365m declared in April 2004 relating to the 2003 04 financial year has been reversed in the opening Balance Sheet and charged to equity in the Balance Sheet as at 26 February 2005.
Similarly, the final dividend accrued for the 2004 05 financial year of 410m has been reversed in the IFRS Balance Sheet as at 26 February 2005 and has been charged to equity in the Balance Sheet as at 25 February 2006.
Leasing IAS 17 There are two impacts that have arisen from the adoption of IAS 17 firstly, the reclassification of some leases between operating and finance leases, and secondly, the treatment of fixed rental uplifts.
Reclassification between operating leases and finance leases The finance lease tests under UK GAAP and IFRSs are broadly similar except that IAS 17 requires the Group to consider property leases in their component parts i. e. land and building elements separately.
96 Tesco plc Note 32 Explanation of transition to IFRSs continued Following a detailed review of our property lease portfolio, a small number of building leases have been reclassified as finance leases and brought onto the Balance Sheet as at 29 February 2004, based on the criteria of IAS 17.
This led to a relatively small increase in Property, plant and equipment, and a similar increase in the finance lease creditor.
The following adjustments have been made at the opening Balance Sheet and as at 26 February 2005: 29 February 26 February 2004 2005 m m Property, plant & equipment 29 49 Adjustment to net assets 4 5 The associated impact on the Income Statement of the above is that some UK GAAP operating lease expenses are replaced with depreciation and financing charges for the building elements of the reclassified leases.
Over the life of the lease, the total Income Statement charge remains the same, but the timing of expenses will change, with more of the total expense recognised earlier in the lease term.
The net pre-tax impact on the Income Statement is immaterial for the year ended 26 February 2005.
In 2004 05 there was a one-off Income Statement adjustment of 4m, relating to the deferral of some profit from the sale and leaseback transaction completed in April 2004, which instead will be recognised over the 25-year lease term.
Fixed rental uplifts The Group has a number of leases that contain minimum rental uplifts at predetermined rent review dates.
Some of these leases are with external landlords and some with the Groups property joint ventures.
The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC has recently clarified that it is necessary to account for these increases on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Previously, the Group charged such increases to the Income Statement in the year they arose.
The total amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the Income Statement charge changes.
The excess of the rent charged to the Income Statement over the cash payment in any given period will be held on the Balance Sheet in Trade and other payables.
This change in accounting treatment has the following effect on the Balance Sheets as at 29 February 2004 and 26 February 2005, and the Income Statement for 2004 05.
29 February 2004 05 26 February 2004 Income 2005 Balance Sheet Statement Balance Sheet m m m Operating profit impact 1 12 13 Joint ventures and Associates 44 Deferred tax 33 Impact on net assets profit after tax 1 5 6 Employee benefits IAS 19 Post-employment benefits For UK GAAP reporting, we applied the measurement and recognition policies of SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs for pensions and other post-employment benefits, whilst providing detailed disclosures for the alternative measurement principles of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
IAS 19 takes a similar approach to accounting for defined benefit schemes as FRS 17, thus on transition, the deficit disclosed under FRS 17 has been recognised in the Balance Sheet.
At the opening Balance Sheet, this resulted in a pre-tax reduction in net assets of 676m representing the sum of the deficit plus the reversal of a SSAP 24 debtor in the UK GAAP Balance Sheet as at 29 February 2004.
An associated deferred tax asset of 199m has been recognised in respect of the pension deficit.
Therefore the total adjustment to net assets as at 29 February 2004 was 477m.
Tesco plc 97 Notes to the financial statements continued Note 32 Explanation of transition to IFRSs continued Thereafter, the Group has chosen to apply the amendment to IAS 19 which allows actuarial gains and losses to be recognised immediately in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense i. e. the actuarial gains and losses will be taken directly to equity.
The incremental pre-tax Income Statement charge for 2004 05 from the adoption of IAS 19 is 41m.
This is split between the current service cost increases operating costs by 45m and the return on plan assets increases finance income by 4m.
The related tax effect of this is a 12m credit to the Income Statement.
The actuarial loss on the scheme for 2004 05, recognised through reserves, is 230m, with an offsetting tax adjustment of 67m.
The February 2005 IAS 19 pension deficit is 735m, with an associated deferred tax asset of 279m.
Joint ventures IAS 31 and Associates IAS 28 The Group applies the equity method of accounting for joint ventures JVs and associates, which is largely consistent with how they were accounted for under UK GAAP.
The adoption of IFRSs leads to a change in the presentation of the Groups share of the results of our JVs and associates.
Under UK GAAP, we included our share of JV and associate operating profit before interest and tax and showed our share of their interest and tax in the respective Group lines within the Profit and Loss Account.
Under IFRSs, JV and associate profit is shown as a net figure i. e. post interest and tax.
This has the effect of reducing profit before tax, but reduces the tax charge.
Overall, there is no impact on the Group profit after tax as this is purely a presentational change.
Another impact of using the equity method of accounting for JVs and associates under IFRSs is that when the Balance Sheet investment relating to a loss-making JV or associate reduces to nil then no further losses should be recognised in the Income Statement.
Under UK GAAP, losses would continue to be recognised.
This change has led to a small adjustment in the opening Balance Sheet of 1m and an increase in JV and associate profit of 2m in 2004 05.
Impairment of assets IAS 36 Under IAS 36, individual assets are reviewed for impairment when there are any indicators of impairment.
Where individual assets do not generate cash flows independently from one another, the impairment reviews are carried out at the Cash-Generating Unit level, which represents the lowest level at which cash flows are independently generated.
The illustrative examples in IAS 36 suggest that for retailers this is at the individual store level.
Following impairment reviews at the opening Balance Sheet date, we identified a small number of stores which required provisions for impairment of 142m.
This had the effect of reducing the total fixed asset balance by approximately 1% as at 29 February 2004.
A similar review was performed for 2004 05 but no further stores required an impairment provision.
However, due to movements in foreign exchange rates, the overall provision set against fixed assets increased by 10m this consolidation adjustment has been taken through equity, with no impact on the 2004 05 Income Statement.
The methodology and assumptions applied in the impairment reviews conducted on transition to IFRSs can be found in note 11.
IAS 36 has the additional effect of reducing the deferred tax liability by 15m as at February 2004 and 17m as at February 2005 the movement year-on-year relates to foreign exchange differences which have been taken to equity.
The deferred tax adjustments arise because the impairment reviews have reduced the carrying values of certain assets qualifying for capital allowances, with no corresponding change in the tax base.
Intangible assets IAS 38 Under UK GAAP, we included licences and capitalised development costs within tangible fixed assets on the Balance Sheet.
Under IAS 38, Intangible Assets, such items are disclosed separately on the face of the Balance Sheet.
As a result, there is a reclassification of 255m in the opening Balance Sheet, and 306m in the Balance Sheet as at 26 February 2005, between Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets.
There is no impact on the Income Statement from this reclassification.
98 Tesco plc Note 32 Explanation of transition to IFRSs continued Investment properties IAS 40 Under UK GAAP, we included all owned property assets within Tangible fixed assets on the Balance Sheet.
Under IAS 40, Investment Properties, we are required to split out any property which earns rental income or is held for capital appreciation.
As a result, there is a reclassification of 473m in the opening Balance Sheet and 565m in the Balance Sheet as at 26 February 2005 between Property, plant and equipment and Investment property.
Deferred and current taxes IAS 12 Under UK GAAP deferred tax was recognised in respect of all timing differences that had originated but not reversed by the Balance Sheet date and which could give rise to an obligation to pay more or less taxation in the future.
Deferred tax under IAS 12 Income Taxes is recognised in respect of all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying value for financial reporting purposes.
The change to a Balance Sheet liability method of providing for deferred tax leads to a number of adjustments, as follows: 29 February 2004 05 26 February 2004 Income 2004 05 2005 Net assets Statement Reserves Net assets m m m m Impact of IAS 12 79 13 2 94 Tax effect of accounting changes 232 33 78 343 Net impact on tax balance profit after tax 153 20 76 249 JV and Associate presentation change 32 Total impact on tax 52 Includes foreign currency translation differences in respect of foreign operations The significant components of the Balance Sheet adjustments are the recognition of deferred tax assets on the pension deficit and share-based payments, less deferred tax provisions for potential future gains arising from rolled-over gains and for the potential future tax liabilities arising from fair value adjustments recorded for business combinations.
Neither of these provisions were previously recognised under FRS 19.
Other adjustments Other adjustments arise from the reclassification of money-market deposits from current asset investments to cash and cash equivalents as a result of the definition within IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements, and other minor presentation differences.
Significant changes to the Cash flow statement for 2004 05 None of the adjustments arising from IFRSs relate to cash, and therefore there is no impact on reported cash flows.
However, IAS 7 Cash flow statements extends the definition of cash to cash and cash equivalents which includes movements on short-term deposits.
This results in a change in presentation of the cash flow information to include these cash equivalents.
m Increase in cash as reported under UK GAAP 121 Movement on short-term deposits cash equivalents under IFRSs 97 Increase in cash and cash equivalents per IFRS definition 24 Cash and cash equivalents as at 29 February 2004 1,100 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 22 Cash and cash equivalents as at 26 February 2005 1,146 Tesco plc 99 Notes to the financial statements continued Note 33 Effect of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on Financial instruments The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 27 February 2005 and has taken the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The analysis below details the transitional adjustments arising from the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 as at 27 February 2005.

Limited.
These shares are expected to be purchased in three tranches in 2007, 2011 and 2012.
The purchase price will reflect the market value of these shares at the date of acquisition.
Under IAS 32, the net present value of the future payments are shown as a financial liability, the value of which was 228m at 27 February 2005. b The deferred tax impacts of the introduction of IAS 32 and IAS 39 as at 27 February 2005 is 28m.
c In 2003, the Group monetised profitable interest rate swaps.
The amount realised was held in deferred income and amortised through the interest line in the Income Statement.
On transition to IAS 32 and IAS 39, the remaining credit balance held in deferred income of 163m was transferred to retained earnings.
Under IFRS 1, there is a corresponding credit of 163m to the value of financial liabilities, which is subsequently amortised through the interest line in the Income Statement.
The net effect is a transfer of 163m from deferred income to financial liabilities, with no impact on the Income Statement and net assets.
d Other adjustments are due to the marking-to-market of financial instruments and the reclassification of other creditors and debtors which are defined as net borrowings under IFRSs.
