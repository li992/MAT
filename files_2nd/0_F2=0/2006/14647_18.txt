Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 95 Notes to the parent Company financial statements 1. significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off all other assets over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold properties Over the lease period Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, ttings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at net present value.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long term or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over their useful life.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Trade and other debtors Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identied.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable that it will be required to settle by an outow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
96 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 1. significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange profits and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
Issue costs are amortised over the expected life of the instrument.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
From 1 January 2005, hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as xed to oating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against xed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, xed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance sheet date by the change in the fair value attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to uctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The Companys policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value with effect from 1 January 2005.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the Companys exposure to movements in interest rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market rates for similar instruments.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 97 For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classied as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash ow hedges where they hedge exposure to the variability in cash ows that is due to the risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
In relation to these fair value hedges interest rate swaps which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account and any gain or loss on the item that is being hedged is adjusted against its carrying amount and recognised in the profit and loss account.
In relation to cash ow hedges forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge rm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the proportion of the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective is recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
When the rm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the associated gains and losses that have previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the carrying amount of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions The Company operates two dened benefit pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
These schemes require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations.
Other schemes are dened contribution in nature.
The assets of the dened benefit schemes are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of the schemes are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The discount rate used to measure the schemes liabilities is the current rate of return on an AA corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
The extent to which the schemes assets exceed or fall short of the schemes liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit in the balance sheet net of deferred tax.
The regular service cost of providing retirement benets to employees in dened benefit schemes is charged to operating profit in the year together with the cost of providing benefit improvements in respect of past service and gains or losses arising on settlements and curtailments.
A credit for the expected return on the schemes assets and a charge for the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities because the benets are one year closer to settlement, are included in other finance income or expense in the profit and loss account.
Differences arising between the actual and expected returns on the schemes assets together with changes in the actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
Contributions payable to the other dened contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year for which they are due.
Treasury shares Spirent Communications plc shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
98 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 1. significant accounting policies continued Employee benets When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benets expected to be paid in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that will ultimately vest, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date and based on the best available estimates.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modied, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modied.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modication, as measured at the date of modication.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modication of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain options to employees.
Shares are held by the employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except as referred to below.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of xed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.
Employees Please refer to the Report on directors remuneration on pages 26 to 32 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, share options and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.

Pensions Dened benefit schemes The dened benefit schemes are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Staff Pension Plan and the Retirement Cash Plan.
These schemes have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the schemes assets and the present value of the dened benefit schemes obligations using the project unit credit method at 1 April 2003 have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.
The triennial actuarial valuations of the schemes at 1 April 2006 are currently in progress.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of 41.9 million in the Company is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Companys statement of recognised gains and losses before 1 January 2003.
Expected cash contributions for 2007 for these schemes are 0.3 million.
The above schemes are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs tax-exempt approval.
Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the HM Revenue & Customs statutory earnings cap, have had their benets increased through unapproved, unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of the basic salary only.
The Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benets itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2006 of 0.7 million 2005 0.7 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Companys pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a Market Value basis in line with the Main Plan Valuation and adjusted each year by the charge for the year equivalent to a contribution to a funded plan of nil 2005 0.1 million.
Dened contribution schemes United Kingdom The Company maintains dened contribution pension schemes for employees in the UK.

a 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed however outstanding options may still be exercised and has been replaced by the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan referred to in b below.
Awards under the ESOS, normally determined annually, were at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS are subject to the achievement of an earnings per share EPS performance condition before they can be exercised.
The condition is that over a period of three consecutive financial years, there has been an increase in the Companys adjusted EPS which is at least 6 per cent more than the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
The performance condition is tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if it has not been met at that time, at each subsequent anniversary of grant until the option expires ie on the tenth anniversary of grant in normal circumstances.
All ESOS grants made after 11 May 2000 to executive directors are subject to an enhanced performance condition.
The performance condition requires the Companys adjusted EPS to increase over a period of three consecutive financial years within a range of 9 per cent minimum performance for 25 per cent option vesting and 15 per cent for 100 per cent option vesting, with a sliding scale between these points.
In addition, performance testing over the ten year option term is measured from a base point xed at the date of grant.
Performance will be tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if the target conditions at that time have not yet been met in full, performance will be tested again on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant only, with the performance hurdle being increased in proportion to the extended period.
b 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP On 4 May 2005, Spirent shareholders approved the EIP to replace the now closed ESOS scheme.
The EIP is currently available for selected employees including executive directors on a similar discretionary basis as the ESOS and any awards will be subject to prior satisfactory individual performance.
No price is payable on the grant of an award and no award has been granted at a discount to the market price.
The Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights SARs and performance shares under the EIP.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 109 In normal circumstances, options or SARs under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys EPS growth targets after excluding ination have been met over a three year performance period.
The growth targets in respect of the initial award require that the Companys EPS increases within a range of 6 per cent per annum for 25 per cent vesting and 15 per cent per annum for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
In normal circumstances, performance shares under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys total shareholder return TSR targets have been met over a three year performance period.
The performance conditions require Spirents TSR to be between the median of a comparator group for 30 per cent vesting and the upper quartile of a comparator group for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
The comparator group consists of the 30 largest companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those TechMARK companies who are also constituents of the FTSE100 Index at the commencement of the performance period.
All EIP awards will be tested once on or shortly following the third anniversary of grant.
Any part of an award which does not vest shall lapse ie there is no opportunity for retesting.
SARs granted under the EIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in market value of an Ordinary share over the base price of the SAR in the form of new issue Ordinary shares.
This SARs approach will help the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value needs to be funded.
Using a SARs based approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed.
c UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Companys savings carrier to save a regular sum of between 5 and 250 per month for a xed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market price of an Ordinary share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the contractual commitment to deliver Ordinary shares against the exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS and Spirent Sharesave Trust Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST.
During the year, 1.4 million shares were transferred to participants.
No invitations have been made under either UK Sharesave Scheme since 2003.

Share-based payment The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows: 2006 2005 million million 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 0.3 0.4 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.4 0.2 All Employee Share Plans 0.1 0.1 0.8 0.7 The fair value of the options and purchase rights over Ordinary shares is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payments charge: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price pence 37 53 Weighted average fair value pence 28 24 Expected volatility % 40-50 50 Expected life years 4.5 4.5 Risk free rate % 4.7-5.1 4.2 Dividend yield % nil nil The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 50 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.
