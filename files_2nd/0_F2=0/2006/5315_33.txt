Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to uctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
All financial instruments are accounted for on trade date.
Credit risk All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis.
Trading receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience and assessment of their current economic environment.
The average credit period taken by customers is 54 days 2005: 51 days.
The investment management of liquid funds aims to maximise the return on net funds subject to the security of the principal and the liquidity of the Group.
The Group identies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings, and that these limits are not exceeded.
The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time, and because of the low levels of debt and therefore interest rate risk in the Group.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
Two interest rate swaps have been entered into in order to achieve this policy.
The swaps mature over the next five years following the maturity of the related loans, one of which is amortising, and have xed swap rates of 1.15% and 3.85%.
At 31 March 2006 the Group had interest rate swaps with notional contract amounts of JPY 800m 2005: nil and Euro 5.4m 2005: Euro 6.3m.
The Group classies these interest rate swaps as cash ow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of swaps at 1 April 2005 was adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of swaps at 31 March 2006 was nil, comprising assets of 0.1m and liabilities of 0.1m.
These amounts were recognised as fair value derivatives.
As at 1 April 2005 the net fair value of swaps was 0.2m, which was adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
Multi-currency cash pooling is in place with our banks across the Group to ensure daily netting of almost all the Groups cash ows in all currencies with consequent improvements to liquidity and interest costs.

The oating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings, bearing interest at rates xed in advance for periods ranging from overnight to 12 months by reference to the relevant inter-bank rate, plus overdraft balances.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk primarily because purchases in currencies other than Sterling are much less than its receivables in those currencies.
Substantial hedging of currency exposures over catalogue lives is implemented in order to shelter forecast gross profits.
In this way the impacts of currency uctuations are smoothed until selling or cost prices can be changed in light of the movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury on the basis of trading projections provided by local businesses.
Specic cash ows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
Foreign currency translation exposures are not explicitly hedged, but local currency debt is used where economic and scally efficient in the nancing of subsidiaries and this provides a partial hedge, particularly in the case of US Dollars, where the exchange rate movements relating to the US Dollar debt originally arising from the Allied acquisition largely offset the impact on underlying assets.
Guidelines are in place for reviewing the impact of translation exposures arising from both the currency mix of the Groups net debt and of net assets should there be any material changes.
Forecast transactions The Group classies forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash ow hedges.
These forecast cash ows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 16 months from the year end, and will affect the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts 0.9m as at 1 April 2005 was adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2006 was -0.1m, comprising assets of 0.9m and liabilities of -1.0m that were recognised in fair value derivatives.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2006 was nil.
The total net amount recognised in equity in the year to 31 March 2006 was -0.2m and the total net amount removed from equity during the year and taken to the profit and loss account was -0.8m.
