During the year to 31 March 2006, the Company repurchased and subsequently cancelled 45,868,642 Ordinary Shares, representing 9% of the issued share capital, at a total cost of 191.6m.
The nominal value of the shares was 22,934, which was transferred to a capital redemption reserve.
The profit and loss account was reduced by 191.6m.
This amount included 870,030 Ordinary Shares purchased in the year to 31 March 2005 which were cancelled in the current year.
The cost of own shares held in the Burberry Group ESOPs has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Burberry Group and the Company.
As at 31 March 2006 the amounts offset against this reserve are 16.0m 2005: 19.0m.
The capital reserve consists of non-distributable reserves and the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares.
