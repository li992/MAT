5041 BHPB AR06 Pt2 13 9 06 10:11 PM Page 172 Notes to Financial Statements continued 8 Income tax and deferred tax continued Deductible temporary differences At 30 June 2006, the BHP Billiton Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of US$1,791 million 2005: US$1,537 million have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
The BHP Billiton Group anticipates it will continue to incur foreign expenditure including exploration, or incur losses, in jurisdictions in which, under current accounting policies, the tax-effect of such expenditure or losses may not be recognised.
The BHP Billiton Group will continue to incur non-deductible accounting depreciation and amortisation.
The BHP Billiton Group recognises net deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and temporary differences to the extent that it can reasonably foresee future profits against which to realise those assets.
Following continued progress in the BHP Billiton Groups Gulf of Mexico US projects, additional benefits of tax losses and temporary differences have been recognised in the current year resulting in a reduction in the effective tax rate of approximately 3 per cent 2005: 4 per cent when compared to the statutory tax rate.
If and when the projects reach appropriate milestones that provide greater certainty over projected future profits, further benefits in respect of past losses and temporary differences may be recognised.
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities At 30 June 2006, deferred tax liabilities of US$1,446 million 2005: US$1,156 million associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities have not been recognised because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Other factors affecting taxation The Australian Taxation Office ATO has issued assessments against subsidiary companies, primarily BHP Billiton Finance Ltd, in respect of the 1999-2002 financial years.
The assessments relate to the deductibility of bad debts in respect of funding subsidiaries which undertook the Beenup, Boodarie Iron and Hartley projects.
The assessments are for primary tax of US$511 million and interest net of tax and penalties of US$375 million.
Appeals have been lodged to the Federal Court against the assessments.
As at 30 June 2006, the total amount in dispute relating to bad debts on loans is approximately US$886 million, including accrued interest and penalties after tax.
A total amount of US$472 million in respect of the disputed amounts has been paid pursuant to ATO disputed assessments guidelines.
The amounts paid have been recognised as a reduction of the Groups net tax liabilities.
Upon any successful challenge of the assessments, any sums paid will be refundable with interest.
