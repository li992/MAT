2 This column shows the amount by which exposures to counterparties are reduced by the existence of a legal right of set-off on the basis that the financial asset will be collected in accordance with its terms and under master netting arrangements.
The credit risk of financial assets subject to a master netting arrangement is eliminated only to the extent that financial liabilities due to the same counterparty will be settled after the assets are realised.
The extent to which the Group's credit risk is reduced through a master netting arrangement may change substantially within a short period following the balance sheet date because the exposure is affected by each transaction subject to the arrangement.
