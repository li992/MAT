PENSION COMMITMENTS J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The Scheme has two parts: a defined benefit section which is closed to new members and money purchase arrangements which have been set up for Lord Rothschild.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Group has adopted the revised version of International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits IAS 19, published in December 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the income statement in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method.
The employer contribution rate to the Scheme for the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 December 2005 was 35% of pensionable salaries and the rate was increased to 47% for the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 March 2006.
The corresponding rate for the previous year was 35%.
A special contribution of 3.4 million was made in March 2005 to extinguish the deficit in the Scheme at that time.
The funding rate in respect of the money purchase scheme was 20% of pensionable salary up to 31 December 2005 and the funding of this section of the Scheme was discontinued thereafter by mutual agreement 31 March 2005: 20%.
No changes have been made to these funding rates to date.
Two members opted out of the Scheme in respect of pensionable service after 5 April 2006 and, accordingly, it is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 March 2007 will be reduced to 0.2 million 31 March 2006: 0.3 million.
Since the defined benefit Scheme is closed to new entrants, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salary, calculated using the projected unit method, is expected to increase as the current membership approaches retirement.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
The full actuarial valuation of the scheme which was carried out as at 1 January 2005 was updated to 31 March 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following tables: At At 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 Discount rate 4.90% 5.40% Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 4.25% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% 4.00% Inflation assumption 3.00% 2.90% The mortality assumptions employed as at 31 March 2006 are based on the tables set out below and include allowance for future improvements in life expectancy by projecting past improvement rates to calendar year 2030 for current active members and deferred pensioners, and to calendar year 2010 for current pensioners.

As at 31 March 2006, the expected rate of return on the Schemes assets was 8.9% per annum 31 March 2005: 7.4% per annum.
This rate is equal to the weighted average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the asset classes that the Scheme was invested in at 31 March 2006.
