Effective 1 March 2006, a deferred tax liability of 57m associated with the Groups interest in Emap France was transferred into Assets classied as held for sale see Note 16.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset against each other where they relate to the same tax jurisdiction.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for continuing operations for balance sheet purposes: 2006 2005 m m Deferred tax assets 6 5 Deferred tax liabilities 66 102 60 97 i The Group has net deferred tax liabilities provided across the categories set out above totalling 60m 2005: 97m of which 3m 2005: 9m is due within one year and 57m 2005: 93m is due after more than one year.
ii Of the total net deferred tax liability, 6m 2005: 5m is disclosed as a non-current asset and 66m 2005: 102m is disclosed as a non-current liability.
The assets due within one year total 3m, and after more than one year total 3m.
The liabilities due within one year total 6m, and after one year total 60m.
iii The Group has tax trading losses in the US totalling 200m see iv below carried forward at 31 March 2006.
The core of these losses was generated by a business principally disposed of in 2002 and historically these losses have been disclosed as items of unprovided deferred tax.
With the acquisition of WGSN, it is anticipated that the previously unprovided losses will begin to be utilised, and as such a deferred tax asset has been recognised in the period.
iv The Group has unprovided deferred tax on tax trading losses totalling 197m of which 184m 2005: 189m are held in the US and 13m 2005: nil in the UK.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose.
The losses have varying expiry dates from 2016 to 2025.
The Group also has unprovided deferred tax on capital losses totalling 543m which arise entirely in the UK.
The UK trading and capital losses have no expiry date.
v The UK Group has minimised capital gains on the disposal of assets by rolling the gain on the assets sold into the acquisition cost of new businesses.
The resulting reduction to the tax base cost of the acquired businesses is 21m.
The acquired businesses are not anticipated to be sold in the foreseeable future.
vi On 28 February 2006, Emap announced its intention to sell Emap France.
It is not anticipated that the sale of Emap France will generate a tax liability on sale due to the use of local French tax attributes and the availability of UK substantial shareholdings relief.
vii No deferred tax liability is recognised on the unremitted earnings of continuing overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures as any remittances would not give rise to tax payable in the foreseeable future.
