Business combinations a Lombard acquisition On 11 January 2005 the Group acquired 100% of the voting rights of Lombard, a non-listed wealth management group of companies, incorporated in Luxembourg.
The following table summarises the transaction: m Fair value of net assets acquired 255 Goodwill arising on acquisition 139 Total 394 Discharged by: Issue of 150.2m ordinary shares in the company 250 Issue of Friends Provident plc loan notes due 2011 18 Cash 41 Future consideration 75 Acquisition costs 10 Total consideration 394 Total consideration and goodwill arising on acquisition have been revised in 2006 to reflect the revised estimate of the final amount of future consideration payable.
The 250m fair value of shares issued was based on the market price on the date of exchange.
150,249,291 ordinary shares of Friends Provident plc were issued for the acquisition in three individual allotments 1st allotment: 113,477,763 shares at 1.645 per share, 2nd allotment: 389,414 shares at 1.733 per share and 3rd allotment: 36,382,114 shares at 1.705 per share.
Future consideration represents the earn-out payment to be made which is variable on Lombards 2006 performance.
Earn-out payments in respect of 2004 and 2005 performance have already been settled in shares, cash and loans.
The 2006 payment is dependent on Lombard achieving certain performance thresholds for both new business profits and underlying embedded value.
The earn-out payment is payable in shares or cash, at the Groups option.
The payment in respect of 2004 was capped at 90m 62m and the payment in respect of 2005 was capped at 85m 59m with any excess combined with the final potential payment in respect of 2006.
The goodwill of 139m is attributable to the quality, experience and knowledge of Lombard management and staff, which is expected to generate significant new business value in the foreseeable future.
Such experience and knowledge manifests itself in existing business relationships and the ability to maintain and further develop these, and processes that are not captured in separately identifiable intangible assets.
The diversification of Lombards business and the flexible business model and relatively unique competitive position also adds significant value.
The estimated 2006 earn-out payment is 111m 75m and this amount is included in provisions on the balance sheet.
This payment is lower than previously estimated, resulting in a 12m release of the provision held at 31 December 2005, which has been offset against goodwill.
This has no impact on the fair value of the net assets acquired.
The final determination of the earn-out payment will take place in April 2007. b F&C Commercial Property Trust plc In January 2005, F&C Commercial Property Trust plc CPT was incorporated as an investment trust and subsequently listed.

This was discharged by way of 465m ordinary shares with a nominal value of 0.90 issued at 1 each.
