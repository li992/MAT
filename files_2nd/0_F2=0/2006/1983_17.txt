Future cash flows are based on board approved budgets and strategic plans for a period of the next three years.
Forecasts for the following years are conservatively extrapolated based on the growth rate and profitability outlined in the approved plans.
The following key assumptions in the value in use calculations were uniformly applied to each cash generating unit: Budgeted revenue and salary growth was based on the groups approved budgets and strategic plans between 2007 and 2009.
Budgeted margin between 2007 and 2009 was based on the average achieved margin in the 12 month period before the budget period uplifted for expected efficiency improvements which management believes are reasonably achievable.
Growth rates reflected within the cash flows have been increased in line with historic GDP for the appropriate country.

As at 31st December 2006 all outstanding derivatives have a maturity of greater than 12 months.
On 3rd January 2006 the group swapped notional principal of 1150 million from floating to fixed rates to reduce the interest rate exposure arising on its revolving credit facility.
The four swaps entered into for this purpose have been designated as cash flow hedges.
On 25th May 2006 the group undertook a private placement in the US for $250 million at fixed rates for periods between 8-12 years and the amount was immediately converted into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
The conversion into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage six swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
Five of these hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges and one as a fair value hedge.
In the second stage six further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The fixed interest rate cross currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after 5 years and 10 years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
These swaps all have a maturity of over 5 years with no contractual re-pricing.
Cash flow hedges The swap of 1150 million have resulted in the recognition of a derivative asset of 2.9 million.
At 31st December 2006 the fixed interest rates vary from 3.11% to 3.31%, the floating rate being EURIBOR.
The blended rate for the group on this amount is 3.16%.
Of the $250 million private placement $200 million was swapped into fixed rates via sterling swaps.
The fixed rate on the US private placement which has been swapped varies from 5.56% to 5.66%.
The derivative liability recognised on these five instruments is 8.1 million.
The exchange component of this derivative liability has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 12.8 million loss.
The remaining 4.7 million profit has been taken to the hedging reserve.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31st December the fixed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.26% and 4.63% on the fixed European swaps.
The floating Danish krone swap varies is on CIBOR.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The derivative assets and liabilities arising of 1.2 million and 1.4 million respectively are accounted for in reserves as a component part of currency translation.
Of the net liability of 0.2 million the amount that relates to exchange is 1.4 million favourable and the amount that relates to interest fluctuations is 1.6 million adverse.
The groups borrowing under its revolving credit facility, designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The fair value of the borrowings as at 31st December 2006 were 378.5 million 2005: 322.7 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 2.6 million on translation is in reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The swaps used in relation to this hedge have a maturity of between 2 and 5 years with no contractual re-pricing.
Fair value hedges $50 million of the US Private placement was swapped into a floating Danish krone 309.1 million, via a sterling swap.
The sterling swap is dealt with as a fair value hedge.
The ineffective proportion of the fair value hedge resulted in a profit of 40,725 2005: nil.
The fair value hedge has resulted in the recognition of a 3.1 million derivative liability.

The expected volatility for the share option arrangements is based on historical volatility determined by the analysis of daily share price movements over the past 10 years at the time of grant.
The options granted on 31st October 2006 under the Savings Related Scheme are available to all UK employees.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the market price of the shares less 20% on the date of the grant.
Options are conditional on the employee completing 3 years service the vesting period.
There are no other conditions.
The options are exercisable for a period of 6 months after vesting.
The Performance Share Plan PSP provides for the grant of other free shares in the form of conditional shares.
The first award under the PSP was made on 2nd May 2006.
Shares in relation to the award will be released to participants at the end of an expected three-year performance period, dependent upon the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied.
The group uses the Monte-Carlo model to value the award.
The group established a comparator group of 218 other companies from the FTSE 250.
The expected volatility under this model is calculated based on the daily movement of total shareholder return over the three years prior to the grant.
The correlation figure shown is the average against all other companies movements in total shareholder return in the comparator group.
If a company in the comparator group is acquired it has been removed from the performance criteria for vesting, although the remuneration committee can at their discretion replace it.
The dividend yield is set as zero as the value of dividends can only be awarded at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The awards vest as follows: Performance of total shareholder return: % vesting Below median ranking 0 Median ranking 25 Upper quartile 100 Between median and upper quartile 25% to 100% pro-rata on a straight line basis A reconciliation of movements in the number of share options for the group can be summarised as follows: Performance Share Plan Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2006 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2006 pence Exercise period 2nd May 2006 215,089 10,033 205,056 nil May 2009 The Davis 1998 Share Option Scheme Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2006 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2006 pence Exercise period 10th October 2003 269,500 25,500 244,000 367.00 Oct 2006 Oct 2013 2nd June 2005 460,000 60,000 400,000 445.75 Jun 2008 Jun 2015 Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2005 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2005 pence Exercise period 10th October 2003 367,500 65,500 32,500 269,500 367.00 Oct 2006 Oct 2013 2nd June 2005 460,000 460,000 445.75 June 2008 June 2015 The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2006 68 Notes to financial statements 20a Share based payments continued The Davis Service Group Savings Related Share Option Scheme Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2006 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2006 pence Exercise period 15th October 2004 97,717 2,868 17,484 77,365 299.00 Dec 2007 May 2008 15th October 2004 217,084 3,346 32,108 181,630 299.00 Dec 2009 May 2010 31st October 2006 403,993 3,720 400,273 396.00 Dec 2009 May 2010 Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2005 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2005 pence Exercise period 15th October 2004 186,085 9,574 78,794 97,717 299.00 Dec 2007 May 2008 15th October 2004 368,685 9,999 141,602 217,084 299.00 Dec 2009 May 2010 In total 6,214 options at a price of 2.99 were exercised.

Defined benefit plans Within the United Kingdom, the group principally operates a registered defined benefit scheme The Davis Service Group Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The group has also established stakeholder arrangements on behalf of its UK employees.
Overseas, the only significant pension arrangements are the defined benefit schemes operated in Ireland and unfunded schemes within Sweden, Germany and Norway.
Under such schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall deficit on the funded plans is 27.8 million of which 25.3 million is in respect of the main UK plan and on unfunded plans it is 14.3 million.
Where a defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, together with eight other defined benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31st December 2006 by qualified actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2006 2005 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.0 3.7 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 2.7 Discount rate 5.1 4.8 Inflation rate 3.0 2.7 Expected return on plan assets Equities 7.6 7.5 Bonds 5.0 4.9 The main UK defined benefit scheme representing 82% of the group liabilities assumes a mortality assumption in line with PA92SC2006 and PA92SC2020 incorporating projected improvements to life expectancy to 2006 current pensioners and 2020 non-retired members with the short-cohort adjustment applied.
This is based on the actuarys best estimate of mortality within the scheme.
