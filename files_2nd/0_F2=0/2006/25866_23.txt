Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st January 2006 A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIODS BEING REPORTED, IS SET OUT BELOW.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historic cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial statements of investment trust companies SORP as issued by the AITC in December 2005.
The Company has adopted certain new accounting policies due to the issue of new financial reporting standards FRSs.
Further details can be found on this and the following pages as well as in Note 16 which summaries all restatements and prior year adjustments.
The SORP and the listing rules have also given rise to some changes in the presentation.
The Statement of Total Return is now called the Income Statement and the total return column, as opposed to the revenue column, is now the profit and loss account of the Company.
There is a new primary statement, the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds.
The Company has a dormant and wholly owned subsidiary The Mercantile Investment Trust Limited.
Consolidated accounts have not been prepared as exemption under S229 of the Companies Act 1985 has been exercised due to the immateriality of the subsidiary.
Valuation of investments Investments are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Listed investments are valued at bid market prices.
This represents a change in accounting policy, however, in accordance with the exemption conferred by paragraph 108D of FRS 26, comparatives have not been restated.
In prior periods listed investments were valued at mid market prices although for much of the portfolio this was last traded price which is the same as bid price.
As a consequence the adoption of bid prices on 1st February 2005 decreased the value of investments by 7,938,000 as shown in note 8.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted and restricted investments are included at a fair valuation determined by the Directors.
In making its valuations, the Board has taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to the capital reserve realised.
Unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the capital reserve realised.
Income Dividends from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis, with UK dividends being accounted for net of any tax credits and overseas dividends being included gross of any withholding tax.
The income from debt securities is accrued on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt security, in accordance with the guidelines of the SORP.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserve unrealised.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and treated as a capital item or an income item depending on the facts and circumstances of each dividend.
Interest receivable on deposits is recognised in revenue on an accruals basis.
Stock lending income and underwriting commission is recognised in revenue on a receipts basis.
Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Most expenses are allocated wholly to revenue, with the following exceptions: expenses, in so far as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, can be charged to capital reserve realised.
In this respect, the management fees are allocated 50% to capital and 50% to revenue, 38 JPMorgan Fleming Mercantile Notes to the Accounts continued in line with the Boards expected long-term split of revenue and capital returns from the Companys investment portfolio: expenses incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment, and those incidental to the sale of an investment are deducted from the sales proceeds of the investment.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs, and include items such as stamp duty and broker commissions.
In accordance with FRS 25, disclosure of transaction costs is now required, and can be found as part of the investments note on page 44. v. Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation and FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement.
In particular, the 175 million debenture is stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue plus the appropriate accrued finance costs at the balance sheet date.
The finance costs including interest charges are calculated on an effective yield basis.
Finance costs of debt, in so far as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, can be charged to capital reserve realised.
In this respect, the finance costs in relation to the Companys borrowings have been allocated 50% to capital and 50% to revenue, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of revenue and capital returns from the Companys investment portfolio.
Breakage costs on borrowings are allocated 100% to capital, in accordance with the guidelines of the SORP.
Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, using the Companys marginal rate of tax for the accounting period.
Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19 Deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable.
In line with the requirements of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate the tax relief on expenses charged to capital is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to capital.
Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominately operates.
The Company has decided that Sterling is its most appropriate functional currency, which is also the currency in which these accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve, or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of capital or revenue nature.
Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared but not paid or approved are not accrued in the accounts.
As a result, the fourth quarterly dividend is now accounted for in the period in which it is paid.
This has led to an increase in net assets for all those periods where quarterly dividends had been declared but not paid by the year end.
Further details can be found in note 15 on page 47.

Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates both foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing these risks is summarised over the page.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the preceeding year to which these financial statements relate.
Market Price Risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential gain or loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets at least quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to manage the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
JPMorgan Fleming Mercantile 49 Notes to the Accounts continued 19.
Financial instruments continued Cash Flow Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its operations through bank borrowings and retained profits.
The Company borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then can use interest rate swaps to both generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, the Companys borrowings were at fixed rates.
Foreign Currency Risk The value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified two principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments: and Movements in rates affect short-term timing differences.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The material accounting policies adopted in accounting for financial instruments are disclosed on pages 38 and 39.
With the exception of the note on currency exposures, the Company has excluded short-term debtors and creditors from the following analysis.

The fair value of the loans have been calculated by estimating the breakage costs of the loan and any related interest rate swaps.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of the debenture stock.
