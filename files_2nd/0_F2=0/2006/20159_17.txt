78 3i Report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 21 Financial risk management The funding objective of the Group and Company is that each category of investment asset is broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets and that funding needs are met ahead of planned investment.
Credit risk 3is financial assets are predominantly unsecured investments in unquoted companies, in which the Directors consider the maximum credit risk to be the carrying value of the asset.
The portfolio is well diversified and for this reason credit risk exposure is managed on an asset-specific basis by investment managers.
Liquidity risk During the financial year 3i generated a surplus of 1,089 million 2005: 562 million from its investing activities and cash resources at the end of the period amounted to 1,955 million 2005: 1,199 million.
In addition, the Group had available to it undrawn facilities of 488 million at 31 March 2006 2005: 764 million.
The Directors currently view liquidity risk as low.
Price risk The valuation of unquoted investments depends upon a combination of market factors and the performance of the underlying asset.
3i does not hedge the market risk inherent in the portfolio but manages asset performance risk on an asset-specific basis.
Foreign exchange risk 3i reports in sterling and pays dividends from sterling profits.
The Directors seek to reduce structural currency exposures by matching assets denominated in foreign currency with borrowings in the same currency.
The Group makes some use of derivative financial instruments to effect foreign exchange management.
The exposure to the Euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and all other currencies combined is shown in the table below.
Cash flow interest rate risk 3i has a mixture of fixed and floating rate assets.
The assets are funded with a mixture of shareholders funds and borrowings according to the risk characteristics of the assets.
The Directors seek to minimise interest rate exposure by matching the type and maturity of the borrowings to those of the corresponding assets.
Some derivative financial instruments are used to achieve this objective.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group is shown in the table below by the earlier of the contractual repricing or maturity date.

The derivatives line shows the notional value of currency and interest rate swaps.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair value interest rate risk The fair value of 3is derivative assets and liabilities is subject to interest rate risk.
At 31 March 2006 the fair value of derivative financial instruments was 149 million 2005: 45 million.

80 3i Report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 22 Derivative financial instruments continued Forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps The Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to minimise the effect of fluctuations in the value of the investment portfolio from movement in exchange rates.
Foreign currency interest-bearing loans and borrowings are also used for this purpose.
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to profit or loss.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is as follows: 2006 2005 as restated m m Forward foreign currency contracts 1,392 825 Currency swaps 35 68 1,427 893 As restated for the adoption of IFRS.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps is as follows: 2006 2005 as restated m m Fixed rate to variable rate 340 430 Fixed rate to fixed rate 70 70 Variable rate to fixed rate 1,020 849 Variable rate to variable rate 170 170 1,600 1,519 As restated for the adoption of IFRS.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the income statement.

The drawings under the committed multi-currency facilities are repayable within one year but have been classified as repayable at the maturity date as immediate replacement funding is available until those maturity dates.
The undrawn commitment fee on the 150 million committed multi-currency facility is 0.05%.
The margin on this facility increases to 0.20% if the drawn amount is greater than 50% of the facility.

The margin on this facility increases to 0.235% if the drawn amount is between 33% and 66% of the facility, and to 0.26% if the drawn amount is greater than 66% of the facility.
The other borrowings in 2005 principally relate to deposits taken when the Company was a licensed deposit taker.
This activity has now ceased.
All of the Groups borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates.
None of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group.

They are convertible at the option of the Bondholder to cash and ordinary shares at any time from 11 September 2003 to 25 July 2008.

Unless previously realised and cancelled, redeemed or converted, these bonds will be redeemed on 1 August 2008.
Interest is payable on the bonds in equal semi-annual instalments in arrears on 12 January and 12 July each year.
