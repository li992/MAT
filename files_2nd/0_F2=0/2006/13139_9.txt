Auditors remuneration for audit services comprises 0.4m 2005: 0.4m payable to the auditors of the parent companies and 4.3m 2005: 2.8m payable to the auditors of the parent companies and their associates for the audit of the financial statements of the operating and financing businesses, including for 2006 the review and testing of internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Auditors remuneration for non audit services comprises: 0.6m 2005: 0.7m for taxation services, 0.3m 2005: 0.4m for due diligence and other transaction related services, nil 2005: 0.1m for the audit of associated pension schemes and 0.3m 2005: 0.4m for other non audit services.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest schemes, which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
Under these plans, employees are entitled to retirement benefits dependent on the number of years service provided.
The principal assumptions, for the purpose of valuation under IAS19 Employee Benefits, are determined for each scheme in conjunction with the respective schemes independent actuaries and are presented below as the weighted average of the various defined benefit pension schemes: 2006 2005 Discount rate 5.3% 4.9% Expected rate of return on scheme assets 7.0% 7.0% Expected rate of salary increases 4.2% 4.0% Inflation 2.9% 2.7% Future pension increases 2.9% 2.8% The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant market indices.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on the weighted average of each asset category.
Mortality assumptions used in assessing defined benefit obligations make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics and the actuaries expectations for each scheme.
The average life expectancies assumed in the valuation of the defined benefit obligations are set out below.
2006 2005 Male Female Male Female Average life expectancy at 31 December years years years years Member currently aged 60 86 87 83 86 Member currently aged 45 86 87 83 86 The increase in average life expectancies since 2005 follows the triennial actuarial valuation of the UK pension scheme.
The defined benefit pension expense recognised within operating expenses in the income statement comprises: 2006 2005 m m Service cost including curtailment credits of 11m 2005: nil 94 91 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 144 137 Expected return on scheme assets 178 149 Net defined benefit pension expense 60 79 A total of 20m 2005: 21m was recognised as an expense in relation to defined contribution pension schemes.

As at 31 December 2006 the defined benefit obligations comprise 2,921m 2005: 2,890m in relation to funded schemes and 87m 2005: 90m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 19 years 2005: 19 years.
Deferred tax assets of 92m 2005: 133m and deferred tax liabilities of 6m 2005: nil are recognised in respect of the net pension obligations.
The fair value of scheme assets held as equities, bonds and other assets, and their expected rates of return, is shown below: 2006 2005 Expected rate Fair value Proportion Expected rate Fair value Proportion of return on of scheme of total of return on of scheme of total scheme assets scheme scheme assets scheme assets m assets assets m assets Equities 8.0% 1,857 67% 8.1% 1,708 66% Bonds 4.4% 777 28% 4.3% 757 30% Other 5.0% 138 5% 5.7% 110 4% Total 7.0% 2,772 100% 7.0% 2,575 100% The actual return on scheme assets for the year ended 31 December 2006 was 277m 2005: 379m.

Sensitivity analysis Valuation of Reed Elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves judgments about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates are used for each of these factors, determined in conjunction with independent actuaries.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies would have the following approximate effects on the annual net pension expense and the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: Decrease increase in annual net pension expense 7 Decrease increase in defined benefit pension obligations 140 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 7 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 90 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 4 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 100 Additionally, the annual net pension expense includes an expected return on scheme assets.
A 5% increase decrease in the market value of equity investments held by the defined benefit pension schemes would, absent any change in their expected long term rate of return, increase decrease the amount of the expected return on scheme assets by 7m and would decrease increase the amount of the net pension deficit by 90m.
68 Combined financial statements Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 5 Share based remuneration Reed Elsevier provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to directors and employees.
The principal share based remuneration schemes are the Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the Retention Share Plan RSP and the Bonus Investment Plan BIP.
Share options granted under ESOS and LTIS are exercisable after three years and up to ten years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant.
Conditional shares granted under ESOS, LTIS, RSP and BIP are exercisable after three years for nil consideration if conditions are met.
Other awards principally relate to all employee share saving schemes in the UK and the Netherlands.
Share based remuneration awards are, other than in exceptional circumstances, subject to the condition that the employee remains in employment at the time of exercise.
Share options and conditional shares granted under LTIS, RSP and BIP are subject to the achievement of growth targets of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV adjusted earnings per share measured at constant exchange rates.
LTIS grants made in 2006 are variable subject to the achievement of an additional total shareholder return performance target.
The numbers of share options and conditional shares included in the tables below are calculated on the basis that 100% of the awards will vest.
Further details of performance conditions are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 51.
The estimated fair value of grants made in the two years ended 31 December 2006 are set out below.

9 Adjusted figures Reed Elsevier uses adjusted figures as additional performance measures.
Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition integration costs, disposals and other non operating items, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to acquisition integration costs.

11 Acquisitions During the year a number of acquisitions were made for a total consideration amounting to 171m, after taking account of net cash acquired of 7m.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
The fair values of the consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.
Book value Fair on value Fair acquisition adjustments value m m m Goodwill 102 102 Intangible assets 18687 Property, plant and equipment 11 Current assets 99 Current liabilities 17 17 Deferred tax 11 11 Net assets acquired 6 177 171 Consideration after taking account of 7m net cash acquired 171 Less: consideration deferred to future years 22 Net cash flow 149 The fair value adjustments in relation to the acquisitions made in 2006 relate principally to the valuation of intangible assets.
Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benefits which do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including skilled workforces and acquisition synergies that are specific to Reed Elsevier.
In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
The businesses acquired in 2006 contributed 32m to revenue, 6m to adjusted operating profit, reduced net profit by 9m and contributed 7m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a proforma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit and net profit for the year would have been 5,423m, 1,216m and 624m respectively.

The directors of Reed Elsevier PLC have proposed a final dividend of 11.8p 2005: 10.7p.
The directors of Reed Elsevier NV have proposed a final dividend of a0.304 2005: a0.267.
The total cost of funding the proposed final dividends is expected to be 298m, for which no liability has been recognised at the date of the balance sheet.
2006 2005 Dividends paid and proposed relating to the financial year m m Reed Elsevier PLC 199 183 Reed Elsevier NV 203 182 Total 402 365 Dividends paid to Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV shareholders are, other than in special circumstances, equalised at the gross level inclusive of the UK tax credit of 10% received by certain Reed Elsevier PLC shareholders.
The cost of funding the Reed Elsevier PLC dividends is therefore similar to that of Reed Elsevier NV.

77 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2006 13 Goodwill continued For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is recorded in the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from each acquisition.
The carrying value of goodwill recorded in the major groups of cash generating units is set out below.

Value in use is calculated based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value.
The pre-tax discount rates used are between 10-12%, including a risk premium appropriate to the unit being reviewed.
Estimated future cash flows are determined by reference to latest budgets and forecasts for the next five years, with a 3% long term nominal growth rate assumed thereafter.

80 Combined financial statements Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 17 Financial instruments Details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by Reed Elsevier in relation to financial instruments are set out on pages 22 and 23 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The main financial risks faced by Reed Elsevier are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Reed Elsevier businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Reed Elseviers businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk Reed Elsevier maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged as part of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set off.

The carrying amount of derivative financial assets comprises 176m 2005: 174m in relation to fair value hedges, 42m 2005: 21m in relation to cash flow hedges and 1m 2005: 5m held for trading.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities held for trading comprise interest rate derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments on adoption of IAS39 Financial Instruments.
81 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2006 17 Financial instruments continued At 31 December 2006, Reed Elsevier had access to 1,529m 2005: 1,739m of committed bank facilities that expire in two to three years, of which 39m 2005: 67m was drawn.
These facilities principally provide back up for short term borrowings.
After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2006, and after utilising available cash resources, no borrowings mature in the next two years 2005: nil : 25% of borrowings mature in the third year 2005: 46% : 24% in the fourth and fifth years 2005: 11% : 37% in the sixth to tenth years 2005: 29% : and 14% beyond the tenth year 2005: 14%.
Market Risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by Reed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2006, 88% of net borrowings are either fixed rate or have been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 3m 2005: 5m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2006.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 3m 2005: 5m.
The range of changes represents Reed Elseviers view of the changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2006 is restricted to the change in carrying value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction in net equity of 9m 2005: 16m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated 8m 2005: 16m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than sterling, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars see note 22.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2006 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 341m 2005: 373m.
This would be offset to a large degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 197m 2005: 260m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2006 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding borrowings, by 423m 2005: 463m and increase net borrowings by 241m 2005: 318m.
A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 40m 2005: 29m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 49m 2005: 35m.
82 Combined financial statements Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 17 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
Reed Elsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A by Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
Reed Elsevier also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions, schools, and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the balance sheet.
Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS39 Financial Instruments are described below: Fair value hedges Reed Elsevier has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives including cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 839m were in place at 31 December 2006 2005: 954m swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in US dollars USD, euros and Swiss francs CHF to floating rate USD debt for the whole or part of their term.
83 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2006 17 Financial instruments continued The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges, which are included in the income statement, for the two years ended 31 December 2006 were as follows: Fair value Fair value 1 January movement Exchange 1 January movement Exchange 31 December Gains losses on borrowings and 2005 gain loss gain loss 2006 gain loss gain loss 2006 related derivatives m m m m m m m USD debt 5 9 1 15 15 1 1 Related interest rate swaps 5 9 1 15 15 1 1 Euro debt 151 62 15 104 26 14 116 Related Euro to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 152 62 15 105 26 14 117 1 11 CHF debt 86 41 8 53 10 7 56 Related CHF to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 87 41 8 54 10 7 57 1 11 Total USD, Euro and CHF debt 242 94 24 172 21 22 171 Total related interest rate derivatives 244 94 24 174 21 22 173 Net gain 2 22 All fair value hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2006.
At 31 December 2006 there were fair value losses of nil 2005: 3m included within borrowings which relate to debt fide-designated from a fair value hedge relationship.
During 2006, 3m 2005: 5m of fair value losses recognised on adoption of IAS39 Financial Instruments were included in finance income.
Cash flow hedges Reed Elsevier enters into two types of cash flow hedge: 1 Interest rate derivatives which fix the interest expense on a portion of forecast floating rate denominated debt including commercial paper, short term bank loans and floating rate term debt.
2 Foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the Elsevier science and medical businesses for up to 50 months.
84 Combined financial statements Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 17 Financial instruments continued Movements in the hedge reserve pre-tax in 2006 and 2005, including gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments, were as follows: Total Foreign hedge Transition Interest rate exchange reserve loss hedges hedges pre-tax mmmm Hedge reserve at 1 January 2005: gains losses deferred 10 15 65 40 Gains losses arising in 2005 11 21 10 Amounts recognised in income statement 6 5 30 19 Exchange translation differences 1 1 2 4 Hedge reserve at 1 January 2006: gains losses deferred 5 12 7 Gains arising in 2006 1 53 54 Amounts recognised in income statement 3 3 14 8 Exchange translation differences 1 1 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2006: gains losses deferred 2 4 50 52 All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2006.
A deferred tax charge of 15m 2005: nil in respect of the above gains and losses deferred in the hedge reserve at 31 December 2006 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
Of the amounts recognised in the income statement in the year, gains of 14m 2005: 30m were recognised in revenue, and losses of 6m 2005: 11m were recognised in finance costs.
A deferred tax charge of 3m 2005: nil was recognised in relation to these items.
The transition loss relates to interest rate derivatives which were not designated as hedging instruments on adoption of IAS39 Financial Instruments.
The deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges at 31 December 2006 are currently expected to be recognised in the income statement in future years as follows: Total Foreign hedge Transition Interest rate exchange reserve loss hedges hedges pre-tax m m m m 2007 2 32728 2008 1 15 16 2009 77 2010 11 Gains losses deferred in hedge reserve at end of year 2 4 50 52 The cash flows for these hedges are expected to occur in line with the recognition of the gains and losses in the income statement, other than in respect of certain forward foreign exchange hedges on subscriptions, where cash flows may be expected to occur in advance of the subscription year.
