Of the total, tax losses of 3 million will expire at various dates between 2007 and 2013.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 1,150 million 2005: 645 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas operations as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
8 Discontinued operations Following the decision to focus on its core contract catering business the Group disposed of its Inflight catering operations, which operated principally in Continental Europe on 19 December 2005 and its travel concession catering business, Select Service Partner, including Creative Host Services in the US together, SSP on 15 June 2006.
Gross proceeds from the sale of SSP were 1,865 million and costs incurred were 67 million.
In addition, the Group has discontinued its Middle East military catering operations and withdrawn from or disposed of various other businesses, shown as other below.

The recoverable amount of a CGU has been determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.
Residual Pre-tax growth rates discount rates North America 2.0-3.0% 10.9-12.2% Continental Europe 0.9-3.4% 7.6-11.0% United Kingdom 2.3% 9.3% Rest of the World 0.2-13.7% 6.7-21.3% At 30 September 2005, before impairment testing, goodwill of 163 million was allocated to the Italian Onama business within the Continental Europe segment.
Due to poor economic conditions that have impacted the profitability of this business, the Group revised its cash flow forecasts for the Italian CGU and recognised an impairment loss of 107 million against goodwill.
Value in use was calculated by discounting cash flows at a rate of 9.7%.
At 30 September 2006 the recoverable amount of the Italian CGU exceeds the carrying value and no further impairment is considered necessary.

21 Derivative financial instruments Financial risk management The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, trade debtors and trade creditors that are used to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to minimise the Groups financial risks.
The Board approves any changes to the policy.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its borrowings from a number of sources including the bank and public and US private placement markets.
Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is to match its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency earnings are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
For the period of the currency loans, therefore, the objective is to achieve an effective foreign currency hedge in real economic terms.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, currency swaps are taken out which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to an effective amount borrowed by currency.
The borrowings in each currency give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into sterling.
As the borrowings are either less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate movements are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense rather than in the income statement.
Overseas earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
The business is, however, materially protected from any adverse economic or cash effects through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
Interest rate risk As detailed above, the Group has effective borrowings in a number of currencies and its policy is to ensure that, in the short-term, it is not materially exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in its principal currencies.
The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that at least 80% of the Groups projected debt is fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
Hedging activities Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the bond against changes in interest rates.
62 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21 Derivative financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate borrowings.
These instruments swap floating interest payable on these borrowings into fixed interest rates and hedge against cash flow changes caused by changing interest rates.
The cash flows and income statement impact hedged in this manner will occur between one and three years of the balance sheet date.
The SSP disposal proceeds were used to repay floating rate borrowings in June 2006, which effectively terminated the cash flow hedges previously in place.
Net investment hedges The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward foreign exchange contracts and a cross currency interest rate swap to hedge against the change in sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives not in a hedging relationship The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, a cross currency swap and tax equalisation swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.

Provisions in respect of disposed businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals completed during the year.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short-term and long-term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and sundry other claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Environmental provisions are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as other events arise.
24 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 6%-35% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 33 million 2005: 26 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are three main arrangements: Compass Group Pension Plan, the Plan: Compass Pension Scheme, the Scheme: and Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan, CRISP.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This is the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK but existing members of the Plan and the Scheme will continue to accrue benefits under those arrangements.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP there has been a new defined contribution section established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan, CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP or to the Plan or Scheme will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan and the Scheme are defined benefit arrangements that are closed to new entrants other than for transfers under public sector contracts where the Group is obliged to provide final salary benefits to transferring employees.
Such transferees enter into special sections of the Plan, known collectively as the GAD sections, which have been certified by the Government Actuarys Department as broadly comparable to the relevant public sector scheme.
The Plan and the Scheme are operated on a prefunded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the Actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
66 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Post-employment benefit obligations continued Formal actuarial valuations of the Plan and the Scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent valuations were as at 5 April 2004.
The Plan and the Scheme are reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The Scheme was set up from 1 February 2001 to mirror the Granada Pension Scheme and accept the seamless transfer of pension rights for the former Granada Compass plc employees who transferred to Compass Group PLC.
All accrued rights in respect of the Granada Pension Scheme of and in respect of the employees and former employees including pensioners of, or who are attributed to, the hospitality businesses previously owned by Granada Compass plc were transferred to the Scheme together with an agreed share of all the assets of the Granada Pension Scheme under the terms of a specific agreement.
The share of assets was determined on a share of fund basis, whereby the assets transferred were in the same proportion of all the relevant assets of the Granada Pension Scheme as the liabilities transferred to the Scheme bear to the whole of the relevant liabilities of the Granada Pension Scheme.
This has been calculated as a little under 30% as agreed between the actuaries of the respective Schemes.
Interim transfers were made in 2001 and 2003.
The final adjustments resulted in a further transfer of assets of 3.5 million which was received in May 2006.
With effect from 6 April 2006, after a thorough review by the Group, the pensions accruing under both the Plan and the Scheme for future service other than for the protected members in the GAD sections were reduced so that all members now accrue future benefits on an 80th of final salary basis.
In addition, the Group has announced that increases to pensionable pay will be no more than 5% p. a. or the increase in the Retail Price Index if lower.
This, together with additional funding including a lump sum of 280 million from the proceeds of the SSP and Strand Palace hotel disposals and a reduction in the risk profile of investments, means that the Group has taken appropriate measures to control future pension costs in the UK.
Overseas schemes In the USA the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In the Netherlands the Group operates insured defined benefit pension plans where the Group contributions represent the insurance companies assessment of the annual cost of the benefits earned in that year.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland the Group participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
The defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.

Information relating to all option schemes The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 263.8 pence 2005: 245.3 pence.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.4 years 2005: 7.1 years for executive and management schemes and 2.5 years 2005: 3.2 years for employee schemes.
72 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Share-based payments continued For 2006, options were granted on 14 December 2005 and 12 June 2006.
The estimated fair value of options granted on those dates are 42.0 pence and 45.9 pence respectively.
For 2005, options were granted on 1 December 2004 and 1 September 2005.
The estimated average fair value of these options was 65.8 pence and 47.8 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savings-related schemes were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted: Executive schemes Employee schemes 2006 2005 2006 2005 Historical volatility 31.6% 34.8% 32.7% Risk free interest rate 4.3% 4.6% 4.1% Dividend yield 4.6% 4.0% 4.1% Expected life 7.0 years 7.4 years 3.6 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 212p 233p 235p Weighted average option exercise price 211p 229p 179p Long-Term Incentive Plan Full details of the Compass Group Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP can be found in the Remuneration Committees Report.

This is treated as a market-based condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability was built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The remaining 50% of awards made in the year to 30 September 2006 depend on the achievement of the Group Free Cash Flow GFCF target for the three years from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2008.
25% of the award will vest if GFCF of at least 825 million is achieved over the period and the full award will vest if GFCF of 900 million is achieved.
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these two points.
The fair value of these awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the vesting probability being assessed based on a simulation model of the GFCF forecast.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for LTIP awards exercised during the year was 225.5 pence 2005: 237.5 pence.
The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.6 years 2005: 1.7 years.
In 2006, LTIP awards were made on 14 June 2006.
The estimated fair value of awards granted on that date was 120 pence.
In 2005, LTIP awards were made on 21 December 2004.
The estimated average fair value of these awards was 27 pence.
The inputs to the option pricing model are reassessed for each award.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of LTIP awards made during the year: 2006 2005 Historical volatility 28.2% 34.8% Risk free interest rate 4.7% 4.5% Dividend yield 4.3% 3.8% Expected life 2.3 years 2.8 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 206.3p 243.5p 73 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Share-based payments continued Long-Term Bonus Plan Certain executives participating in the Long-Term Bonus Plan in prior years received an award of deferred Compass Group PLC shares.
The award of bonus shares is subject to performance conditions and matching shares may be released by the Company following completion of a further period of service.
The following table illustrates the movement in the number of awards during the year.

The share bonus awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.6 years 2005: 1.2 years.
For 2006, awards were made in December 2005.
The estimated fair value of awards granted on that date was 265 pence.
For 2005, share bonus awards were made in December 2004.
The estimated average fair value of these awards was 374 pence.
Income statement expense and carrying value The Group recognised expenses of 21 million 2005: 41 million for continuing operations and 4 million 2005: 4 million for discontinued operations in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Cash-settled share-based payments The Group has granted phantom share options to certain employees under the terms of the Management Equity Bonus Plan which mirror grants made under the management option plan.
These require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the option to the employee at the date of exercise.
At 30 September 2006, the Group has recorded liabilities of 2 million 2005: 1 million.
The fair value of the phantom options is determined using the binomial distribution pricing model using the assumptions shown above.
The Group recorded total expenses of 1 million 2005: 1 million during the year in respect of cash-settled phantom share options.
28 Business combinations Businesses acquired during the year are shown below.
Adjustments have been made to reflect the provisional fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as follows: Fair value Consideration Net assets Adjustment on of assets and costs acquired acquisition acquired Goodwill Dates m m m m m Onama minority interest purchase 5% December 2005 88 Levy minority interest purchase 51% April 2006 13499 125 Others 1855 13 Total acquisitions in the year 160 14 14 146 Adjustments to prior periods: Deferred consideration payable 55 Adjustments to net assets acquired 1 1 1 5 1 1 6 165 13 13 152 74 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Business combinations continued Net assets acquired and fair value to the Group m Intangible assets 1 Property, plant and equipment 4 Current assets 10 Current liabilities 9 Minority interests 9 13 Adjustments made to the fair value of assets of businesses acquired in 2006 are provisional and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
From the dates of acquisition to 30 September 2006 these acquisitions contributed 10 million to revenue and 1 million to operating profit.
If the acquisitions had occurred at the start of the reporting period, Group revenue from continuing operations would have been 10,825 million and Group operating profit from continuing operations would have been 507 million.
There was no material difference between operating profits arising from acquisitions and cash flows contributed by those acquisitions.

2006 2005 32 Contingent liabilities m m Performance bonds and guarantees of indemnities of associated undertakings 203 183 On 21 October 2005 the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the relationships between Eurest Support Services ESS a member of the Group, IHC Services Inc. IHC and the United Nations.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006 it was announced that the investigation had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS is part of a wider and on-going investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group is co-operating fully.
These investigators have access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young, and further information may emerge which is inconsistent with or additional to the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has however not been contacted by or received further requests for information from the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York or the UN in connection with these matters since January 2006.
No provision has been made in the financial statements in respect of these matters and it is not currently possible to quantify any potential liability which may arise.
The directors currently have no reason to believe that any potential liability that may arise would be material to the financial position of the Group.
The Group, through a number of its subsidiary undertakings, is, from time to time, party to various other legal proceedings or claims arising from its normal business.
Provisions are made as appropriate.
None of these proceedings is regarded as material litigation.
The Group has provided guarantees to certain minority shareholders and joint venture partners over the level of profits which will accrue to them in future periods.

77 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37 IFRS transitional adjustments The previously published financial statements under UK GAAP were restated on an IFRS basis in the document Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS: preliminary restatement of 2005 financial information published on 1 March 2006.
This is available in the Investor Relations section of the Compass Group website www.
com and includes presentational changes and detailed adjustments by line item.
A reconciliation of equity at 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005 and of profit for the financial year to 30 September 2005 is provided below with an explanation of the transitional adjustments.
30 September 1 October 2005 2004 m m Equity reconciliation Total equity under UK GAAP 2,284 2,482 Minority interest as part of equity 73 54 2,357 2,536 Transitional adjustments: IFRS 3 Business combinations treatment of goodwill 260 IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date dividend on paid basis 140 134 IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures 45 39 IAS 19 Employee benefits defined benefit pensions 283 161 IAS 19 Employee benefits other 4 5 IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation put options 163 215 IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement 10 16 IFRS 2 Share-based payments 16 16 IAS 12 Income taxes 11 20 Other 1 1 Total equity under IFRS 2,278 2,269 30 September 2005 m Retained profit reconciliation Profit for the year under UK GAAP 37 Transitional adjustments: IFRS 3 Business combinations amortisation of goodwill 269 IAS 36 Impairment of assets 12 IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures 23 IAS 19 Employee benefits defined benefit pensions 1 IAS 19 Employee benefits other 1 IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation put options 6 IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement 4 IFRS 2 Share-based payments 46 IAS 12 Income taxes 8 Profit for the year under IFRS 209 There is no significant change to the cash flow statement as reported previously under UK GAAP.
78 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37 IFRS transitional adjustments continued Explanation of significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS which affect the Group IFRS 3 Business combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of assets Under IFRS 3, goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and hence is not subject to amortisation.
Instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually.
The goodwill amortisation charge under UK GAAP in 2005 of 269 million is therefore reversed but the impairment charge recognised is increased by 12 million to take account of the higher amount of the related goodwill under IFRS.
IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability because there is no present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Accordingly, no accrual is made in the September 2005 balance sheet for the proposed final dividend of 140 million.
IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures The Group has interests in a number of companies where it shares control with partners.
Under UK GAAP, the Group consolidated 100% of the turnover, results, assets and liabilities where the Group actually exercised dominant influence, with the partners share being shown as minority interest.
Under IFRS, the concept of actual exercise of dominant influence is not relevant and the Group is required to follow the legal form of the agreements more closely and in certain instances consolidates only its share of turnover, results, assets and liabilities.
Although this changes the presentation of the income statement, there is no effect on profit for the financial period attributable to equity shareholders in the Group.
IAS 19 Employee benefits Under IFRS, the full pension surplus or deficit in respect of defined benefit schemes is recognised on the balance sheet.
This is calculated as the difference between the market value of the pension fund assets set against the value of future pension liabilities.
This recognition results in the recognition of a liability of 445 million at 1 October 2004 representing an incremental liability of 192 million compared with that recorded previously.
At 30 September 2005, this liability had increased to 555 million, primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions representing an incremental liability of 302 million.
The impact on total equity is after the offset of adjustments to prepayments and related deferred tax.
The Group is required to calculate the pension cost for defined benefit pension schemes and other post employment benefits using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The Group applies the option within the amendment to IAS 19 that permits immediate recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The current and past service pension costs are shown as a charge to operating profit.
The unwinding of the discount on pension liabilities each year and the expected return on pension assets are presented as finance costs.
The application of IAS 19 increases operating profit by 15 million and increases net finance charges by 14 million resulting in a reduction in the underlying charge of 1 million.
The Group had accrued additional liabilities of 5 million for holiday pay and similar entitlements as at 30 September 2005.
IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation The Group has entered into arrangements with minority shareholders to potentially acquire their interests at some point in the future.
These arrangements include both call options that enable the Group to acquire interests and put options that enable minority shareholders to require the Group to buy out their interests.
Under IAS 32 the present value of put options is recorded as a financial liability, and is reflected as a deduction from equity.
The discounted value of liabilities in respect of put options was 215 million at 1 October 2004.
As at 30 September 2005, this had fallen to 163 million as a result of certain options having being exercised.
The majority of the remaining liability for put options was extinguished during the year to 30 September 2006 on completion of the acquisition of the remaining interest in Levy Restaurants in the United States.
IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement The Group uses currency denominated borrowings and derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
The Group does not acquire or hold derivatives for trading purposes.
Under IAS 39, derivatives are recognised initially at cost and are subsequently required to be measured at fair value.
The fair value is determined by reference to market values for similar financial instruments, or by discounted cash flows.
Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on measurement are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Where hedge accounting is permitted to be employed, recognition of any resulting gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Under UK GAAP, derivatives were not held at fair value so there were no movements in value to account for.
IFRS 2 Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based payments requires the Group to record a charge for all share-based payments equivalent to the fair value of the award as at the date of grant.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over its vesting period on a straight-line basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest.
The Group has applied IFRS 2 to all unvested share awards as at the transition date.
Under UK GAAP, the Group recorded a charge for employee share incentive awards based on the intrinsic value of the award, being the difference, if any, between the option price of the conditional award and the share price on the date of grant.
The Group also utilised the exemption available within UITF Abstract 17 from reporting a charge to profits for UK Inland Revenue approved SAYE schemes and equivalent overseas schemes.
As the Groups share options have an option price equal to the market price on the date of grant, no charge was required to be recorded under UK GAAP.
The application of IFRS 2 has resulted in an incremental charge to profits in 2005 of 46 million.
IAS 12 Income taxes Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, certain temporary differences that previously were not recognised under UK GAAP will be recognised.
In addition, IAS 12 does not allow discounting of deferred tax balances, previously adopted by the Group under UK GAAP.
This results in a higher tax charge under IFRS.
Generally, the Groups effective tax rate under IFRS is expected to be somewhat more volatile than under UK GAAP.
