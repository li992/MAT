The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The model inputs were expected volatility of 17.0% to17.8% dividend yield of 2.8% 2005 - 3.1%, expected option life of 3 to 6.5 years 2005 - 3 to 6.5 and a risk-free interest rate of 4.03% to 4.27% 2005 - 4.26% to 4.74%.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility which assumes that the past trend is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the average exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted were incorporated into the fair value measurement.
SIP The cost of the SIP is accrued at the year end based on the expected value of payout.
The shares are issued to employees after the period end at the market price ruling at the date of grant, as such, no fair value attaches to the SIP shares.
The number of shares issued during the period to employees in relation to their services in the prior period was 0.3 million with a share price on date of grant of 6.62.
The amount accrued at 30 April 2006 for the current year's service is 2.2m 2005 - 1.7m disclosed in note 5.
