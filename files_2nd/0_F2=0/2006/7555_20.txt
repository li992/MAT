The main changes in the new reporting structure related to the way in which balance sheet information is now gathered.
The result of this is that, whilst it has been possible to restate the income statement and cash flow segmental data from the 52 weeks to 24 December 2005 according to the segments used for the 53 week period to 30 December 2006, it is not practicable to restate the 2005 balance sheet information according to the 2006 basis of segmentation.
In accordance with IAS 14: Segment Reporting, the Group has instead presented the balance sheet segment data for the 53 weeks to 30 December 2006 on both the old and the new bases of segmentation.
The 2006 balance sheet information under the new basis of segmentation is shown above, at the end of the section headed Current period.

Restructuring As announced in our press release of 28 February 2006, the Group undertook a review of the store portfolio during the period and prior to the disposal of the MFI Retail business.
Between the start of the period and the disposal of the MFI Retail business, MFI Retail had ceased trading in 13 locations and three regional home delivery centres had closed.
In the same statement, the Group announced its intention to reorganise the Group into three distinct trading businesses.
This process was completed before the disposal of the MFI Retail business.

c. Retirement benefit exceptional gain During the period, the Groups defined benefit retirement benefit plan was altered so that the benefits payable were changed from a final salary basis to a career average revalued earnings basis.
This change gave rise to a reduction in the past service liability in respect of active members, which has been treated as an exceptional gain during the period, as set out in IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The amount of the exceptional gain was 38.0m, and it all relates to continuing operations.
There is related deferred tax of 11.4m.
Further details of the gain are given in note 23. d. Exceptional stock provision This relates to continuing operations.

Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
Other assets Other assets are disclosed separately in the balance sheet and are funds held in escrow to meet future insurance claims from furniture insurance policies written on behalf of the Groups customers.
The balance at the period end was 3.1m 2005: 5.5m and the monies are held with AA-rated financial institutions, and have maturities of up to one year.
Interest is paid at both fixed and floating rates based on LIBOR.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts, or is placed on short-term deposit with maturity periods of less than six months.
Interest on short-term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
Assets pledged as security The Group has pledged its other financial assets to secure bank borrowings in 2006.
More details are given in note 22. Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, other assets, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables of 12.0m 2005: 16.1m.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other assets is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

There is one cash payment of 53.1m due in September 2007 and included in other payables, which has been recorded at its discounted fair value of 50.0m, and another cash payment of 12.0m, due in April 2008, which has been recorded at its discounted fair value of 10.8m.
Galiform Annual Report 2006 71 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21 Other financial liabilities continued The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period was 27 days 2005: 23 days.
The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.
Other payables due in more than one year relate to amounts due to the purchasers of the Groups former MFI Retail business which was sold in the current year.
These amounts are due under the terms of the sale agreement.
Further details of the sale are given in note 12.
22 Borrowings 30 Dec 24 Dec 2006 2005 m m The borrowings are repayable as follows: Current liabilities: On demand or within one year 2.2 Non-current liabilities: In the second year 2.2 In the third to fifth years inclusive 57.7 150.0 Less: prepaid issue fees set against cost of loan 1.7 58.2 150.0 Total borrowings 60.4 150.0 All borrowings are in sterling.
The weighted average interest rates paid on the borrowings were as follows: 2006 2005 % % Weighted average interest rate 6.4 5.3 The directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings are as follows: 30 Dec 24 Dec 2006 2005 m m Total borrowings 60.4 150.0 Until February 2006, the Group had an unsecured revolving facility of 185m, which was repayable in one payment on 31 March 2009.
Under the terms of the facility, the Group could draw down various tranches against the facility for periods of one, two, three, or six months.
Floating rate interest was payable on the each tranche of the facility at the LIBOR rate for the relevant drawdown period, plus a margin of 65 basis points.
In February 2006, this loan was replaced by a 150m secured lending facility for a period of three years and three months to May 2009.
In October 2006, the overall facility limit was increased to 175m, comprising two elements: i. a term loan of 17.4m, secured on the Groups freehold and long leasehold properties, amortising at the rate of 1 96th each month commencing February 2006: ii.
revolving credit equal to the balance of the available facility, secured on the Groups UK assets and investments.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time and can never exceed 175m.
As at 30 December 2006, the Group had available 63.4m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 2005: 35.0m.
The loan carries interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin.
The margin varies between 175 and 250 basis points, and is determined by the minimum headroom against the Groups lending covenants in the prior month.
72 Galiform Annual Report 2006 23 Retirement benefit obligations Defined contribution plan During the 53 weeks to 30 December 2006, the Group began to operate a defined contribution scheme for its employees.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 0.2m 2005: nil represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plans The Group operates two funded pension schemes which provide benefits based on the final pensionable pay of participating employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined separately for each scheme by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial valuation was carried out at 6 April 2005 by the scheme actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward this valuation to 30 December 2006 and restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.
The MFI Retail arm of the Groups operations was sold in 2006 see note 12 for further details of the sale.
The sale took place after the benefits of the Plan were changed from a final salary to a career average revalued earnings basis.
Benefits earned prior to the change will now revalue in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% p. a. instead of in line with salary growth.
This, therefore, reduces the past service liability in respect of the active members.
The MFI Retail employees became deferred members of the Plan after the benefit changes occurred and the sale did not, therefore, affect the past service liability.
The pensionable salary roll in the Plan, and hence the ongoing cost of future accruals, both reduced as a result of the sale.

Relating to the disposal of the MFI Retail operations As disclosed at the time of the transaction with MEP Mayflower Limited MEP, the Group is the ultimate guarantor on leases in relation to 56 properties which are occupied by the MFI Retail operations.
If MEP suffers financial distress and defaults on its obligations under the relevant leases the Groups guarantees are triggered.
For the period ended 25 December 2005 the net rentals payable by the Group in respect of these properties totalled 15.8m.
Remaining lease terms range between six months and 15 years from 30 December 2006.
The Group is not aware of any signs which indicate that the purchaser is in financial distress.
There is uncertainty whether the purchaser will ever suffer financial distress and thereby trigger the guarantee, and as to whether there would be any actual net liability if the Group ever did have to meet the lease obligations, given that the Group could mitigate any liabilities by surrendering or assigning the leases, or by subletting them to third parties.
Because of the nature of the uncertainties, as described above, the Group is unable to give an estimate of the financial effect of this contingent liability.
The Group is also exposed to potential costs in respect of certain warranties and indemnities in relation to the disposal agreement in favour of the purchaser.
The Group has made such provision as is considered necessary in this respect.
Other guarantees The Group has guaranteed a US$10.0m 2005: US$10.0m letter of credit facility from Standard Chartered Bank in favour of MFI Asia Limiteds suppliers.
This contingency would only trigger in the event that MFI Asia Limited fails to honour its obligations under the terms of the facility.
Members of the Group have assigned UK property leases in the normal course of business.
Should the assignees fail to fulfil any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the Group will be liable for those defaults.
The number of claims arising to date has been small and the cost, which is charged to income as it arises, has not been material.
There is a Group VAT registration cross-guarantee under which if one Group company fails to pay its VAT then the other Group companies are jointly and severally liable.
The amount outstanding on this guarantee at the period end is 19.0m 2005: 19.0m.
c. Other Aon have made a claim of 11.5m against the Group in respect of termination of an extended warranty agreement.
On the basis of information available, the Group has been advised that there is little merit in the claim.

Fair value of options granted The fair value of all options granted except Sharesave is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option valuation model.
Sharesave schemes are valued using a Black Scholes model as they are not considered to be of such complexity that they require a binomial model.
The key assumptions used in the models were: 2006 2005 Dividend yield % 1.75 to 4.0 3.75 to 4.0 Expected share price volatility % 38.7 to 41.0 32.0 to 36.1 Historical volatility % 38.7 to 41.0 32.0 to 36.1 Risk-free interest rate % 3.8 to 5.3 4.3 to 4.4 Expected life of options years 1.0 to 6.5 2.4 to 6.5 Historical volatility is measured for each scheme over the period equal to the vesting period of the scheme.
The figure arrived at is then used as the best estimate of expected future volatility.

33 Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first period that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the period of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the 52 weeks ended 24 December 2005 and the date of transition to IFRS was 26 December 2004.
IFRS 1 exemptions IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time.
The Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies for the period ended 24 December 2006 as at 24 December 2005 and apply these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at its date of transition, 26 December 2004.
Galiform Annual Report 2006 89 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 33 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued The standard permits a number of optional exemptions to this general principle.
The Group has adopted the following approach to the key exemptions: Financial instruments: the Group has taken the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Comparative information for 2005 in the 2006 financial statements will be presented on the existing UK GAAP basis.
Share-based payments: the Group has adopted the exemption to apply IFRS2 Shared-based Payment only to awards made after 7 November 2002.
Cumulative translation differences: Under IAS 21 Foreign Exchange, the Group is required to classify all cumulative translation differences as a separate component of equity.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has elected to set the cumulative translation differences reserve to nil at the date of transition.
Goodwill: the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that occurred prior to the transition date.
As a result the goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Sofa Workshop remains at book value as stated under UK GAAP at the transition date and the amortisation for the first half of 2005 has been reversed.
Fair value or revaluation as deemed costs: Under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment PPE, a Company must adopt either a cost or revaluation model for revaluing its PPE.
The Group has elected under IFRS 1 to reflect previously re-valued items of property, plant and equipment at their December 2004 valuations under UK GAAP, as deemed cost on transition.

Three of these operations Hygena Cuisines SA, Sofa Workshop Limited and Sofa Workshop Direct do not meet the definition of discontinued at 24 December 2005 under IFRS but in order to aid comparability with the comparatives shown as discontinued in the interim financial statements their results are included in the reclassification adjustment as shown above.
Key areas of impact on adopting IFRS Further details on the most significant areas of impact on the above balance sheets and income statement are explained below.
Employee benefits a. Share-based payments IFRS 2 The Group operates a range of share-based incentive schemes.
IFRS 2 requires that all shares or options awarded to employees as remuneration should be measured at fair value at grant date, using an option pricing model, and charged against profits over the vesting period.
This treatment has been applied to all awards granted after 7 November 2002 and not fully vested at the date of transition.
The additional pre-tax charge arising from the adoption of IFRS 2 for the period ended 24 December 2005 was 0.4m, resulting in a corresponding reduction in net assets.
92 Galiform Annual Report 2006 33 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued b.
Pensions IAS 19 In 2005 the Group adopted FRS 17 under UK GAAP.
This is broadly similar to the accounting treatment under IAS 19.
Minor adjustments have been made to the pension deficit in the 2005 balance sheet, resulting in an increase in the gross deficit of 1.1m and an increase in the associated deferred tax asset of 0.3m.
This has the effect of reducing the net assets in the 2005 balance sheet by 0.8m.
Property leases c. Lease incentives IAS 17 Under UK GAAP, lease incentives received on entering into property leases were recognised as deferred income on the balance sheet and were amortised to the profit and loss account over the period to the first rent review where rentals are expected to reach a market rate.
Under IAS 17, these incentives are amortised over the entire term of the lease.
As the term of the lease is longer than the period to the first rent review, amounts amortised to the profit and loss account have been restated on the balance sheet as deferred income and released over the term of the lease.
The impact on the balance sheet at date of transition is a reduction in net assets by 9.6m.
The impact on the 2005 income statement was an increased charge to the income statement of 2.1m with a corresponding reduction in net assets.
d. Stepped rents IAS 17 Under UK GAAP, lease costs on entering into a lease were charged to the income statement at the rate agreed in the current rent review period.
Under IAS 17 where a property lease agreement includes fixed rental uplifts fixed rent, then the total cost of the lease must be spread over the term of the lease on a straight line basis.
At the date of transition there was no impact on the net assets of the Company as no such lease agreements were in place.
In 2005 the impact was an increased charge to the income statement of 1.2m and a corresponding increase in creditors.
e. Revaluation of long leaseholds IAS 17 Revaluation of long leaseholds were derecognised at the date of transition resulting in a reduction in net assets of 10.9m.
The corresponding adjustment at 24 December 2005 was a reduction in net assets of 10.6m.
f. Dividends IAS 10 Under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date, as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Consequently the final dividend creditor for 2004 11.6m was derecognised in the transition balance sheet and charged against equity in the 52 weeks to 24 December 2005.
There was no final proposed dividend for 2005 and therefore there is no impact of adopting IAS 10 on the balance sheet as at 24 December 2005. g. Taxation IAS 12 IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences rather than just timing differences as under UK GAAP.
In addition the adoption of IAS 12 results in the Group recognising deferred tax on revaluations and rolled over property gains on disposal.
This has the effect of increasing the tax charge by 3.0m in the 2005 Income Statement and the net assets in the transition balance sheet by 4.4m.
For the Group there were two areas of significance where the difference between tax written down value and book value gave rise to additional deferred tax adjustments under IFRS.
These were: Deferred tax must be provided on re-valued land, this resulted in a deferred tax liability of 0.8m at the end of 2005: and Deferred tax must also be provided on gains on disposal rolled over into land, and this gave rise to a deferred tax liability of 0.4m at the end of 2005.
The effective overall tax rate on the 2005 loss before tax is 387% 817% UK GAAP.
The decrease is a result of deferred tax being provided on all temporary timing differences as described above.
Galiform Annual Report 2006 93 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 33 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Reclassifications In addition, IFRS introduces a number of balance reclassifications that have no direct impact on profit for the period or net assets.
a. Intangible assets IAS 38 Capitalised software costs are currently charged to plant and equipment on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets only software that is an integral part of the related hardware should be included in plant and equipment, all other software should be reclassified as an intangible asset.
This has resulted in capitalised software costs of 4.3m being reclassified as intangible fixed assets as at 26 December 2004.
There is no income statement impact.
Pensions IAS 1 The net of tax presentation is not permitted under IFRS 1.
The deferred tax asset that relates to the pension liability is no longer netted off against the pension creditor but is shown separately as a deferred tax asset.
c. Discontinued operations IFRS 5 IFRS 5 requires separate disclosure of the profit or loss from discontinued operations net of tax in a single line on the face of the income statement.
The impact of reporting discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 is shown in the appendix.
d. Cash flow IAS 7 The format of the cash flow statement will change with cash flow being categorised under the headings of operating, investing and financing.
e. Non operating exceptionals IAS 1 IFRS does not recognise non operating exceptionals.
This contrasts to UK GAAP which required certain items to be separately disclosed on the face of the profit and loss account below the operating profit line.
Items which do not relate to underlying business performance, such profit or loss on disposal of fixed assets will now be reported in operating profit.
In the interests of clarity the Group will highlight individual items contained in operating profit where necessary to ensure that there is a full understanding of performance in any period.
The definition of items to be separately highlighted on the face of the income statement will be consistently applied in future years.
