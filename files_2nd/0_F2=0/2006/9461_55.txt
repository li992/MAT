Share-based payment Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements The group operates seven equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Sharesave scheme, the Executive Equity Participation Plan 2006 ExEPP 2006, the Employee Equity Partnership Plan EmEPP and the Executive Share Option Plan 2006 ESOP 2006 and two further plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Executive Equity Partnership Plan ExEPP.
Under the latter two plans, no further grants will be made as their ten-year award cycle has come to an end, but under which executives still have current awards.
A summary of the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment expense has been recognised.
Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a discretionary bene t offered by the group for the bene t of its senior employees, as well as to staff with high potential or to recognise signi cant achievements.
It effectively supersedes the ESOS as the companys main equity bene t discretionary plan.
An award under the LTIP may be granted as a conditional allocation, a nil or nominal cost option with a short exercise window or as forfeitable shares.
Cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards may also be granted or cash-based payments may be used to satisfy an award originally made in shares either in whole or part, although the Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to do so.
The maximum market value of ordinary shares in the company subject to LTIP awards granted to any employee in any financial year will not exceed 200% of that employees base salary.
The intention initially is not to exceed 150% of salary.
The performance conditions attached to one half of an award will require annual earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum over three financial years for between 30% and 100% of this half of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other half of an award will measure the total shareholder return performance TSR of LogicaCMG over a single three year performance period against a number of other companies drawn mainly from the Dow Jones EuroStoxx Technology Index.
30% of this half of the award will vest if the company is ranked in the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of this half of the award vesting if LogicaCMG is at or above the upper quartile.
The Remuneration Committee intends to review the performance conditions each year to ensure that they remain suitable and re ect the ongoing market.
Sharesave Scheme The group operates a savings-related share option scheme under which employees enter into a savings contract with a financial institution to pay a xed monthly sum for either a three year or, for grants before 4 October 2002, five year period.
Share options are granted at an exercise price at least equal to the closing mid-market price of the companys shares on the day prior to the date of grant.
The aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract.
Share options may be exercised within six months of the vesting date.
There are no performance conditions attached to Sharesave scheme options.
Equity Participation Partnership Plans The group operates an equity participation plan for senior executives, the ExEPP 2006, and in certain countries an equity partnership plan open to all employees, the EmEPP, the terms of which are similar.
Under the equity participation partnership plans, employees make an investment in the companys shares, subject to financial limits, which must be maintained over a three year vesting period.
Vesting will occur for those participants employed at the vesting date, subject to a performance condition being met.
Under the ExEPP 2006, senior executives, in any one year, may invest in shares up to a maximum of 50% of net bonus paid.
These lodged shares will be matched on a 1:1 gross basis the Matching Award.
Matching Award shares will be released as soon as practicable after the third anniversary of the award, subject to the stretching performance condition having been met.
The performance condition in respect of the ExEPP 2006 has the same criteria as the companys LTIP performance condition described above.
The EmEPPs performance condition is based on growth in the groups earnings per share which must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by 3% per annum in each year of the performance period for the award to vest in full.
The Remuneration Committee may, at its discretion, allow Matching Awards under the EmEPP to vest pro rata if performance conditions are met in only one or two years out of the three year performance period.
Awards of a matching number of shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will lapse.
Although no further awards will be made under the ExEPP there remain outstanding awards which have yet to reach their third anniversary.
This plan was operated for senior executives as an equity-based investment plan subject to financial limits and the investment being maintained over a three year vesting period.
Vesting will occur for those executives employed at the vesting date subject to a performance condition based on growth in the groups earnings per share exceeding the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum.
Executive Share Option Plan 2006 At the companys annual general meeting in May 2006 shareholders approved the implementation of the ESOP 2006.
This plan has been introduced to allow awards to be made to senior executives working in jurisdictions where it would be inappropriate to make an award under the LTIP.
It is anticipated that performance conditions attached to any ESOP 2006 awards will have the same criteria as the LTIP noted above.
As yet, no awards have been made under this plan.

Share-based payment continued Executive Share Option Scheme No new option grants will be made under the ESOS, although options made under previous grants to senior executives and managers across the group remain outstanding.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years following grant, provided that a performance condition, speci ed at the date of grant, has been satis ed.
Typically, growth in the groups earnings per share over the relevant performance period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21% for the performance condition to be met.
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven year exercise period, however, option grants in 2005 and 2006 have a four year exercise period.
Retesting of performance conditions may be carried out twice for 2003 option grants, once for 2004 option grants and no retesting is permitted on grants made in 2005 and 2006.
The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the closing mid-market price of the companys shares on the date of grant, although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.
Unilog Management Incentive On 10 January 2006, 1,790,000 options were granted to five former Unilog managers.
This was a one-off conditional share award.
For 1,100,000 options the first half of the award will vest subject to the growth in the groups annual earnings per share exceeding the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 3% between the end of the 2005 financial year and the end of the 2006 financial year.
This part of the award will vest in full if the growth in the groups annual earnings per share exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 7% over the same period.
Between 3% and 7%, this part of the award will vest pro rata on a straight line basis.
To the extent that the first half of the award does not vest, the shares which are not transferred will be added to the shares comprised in the second half of the award.
The second part of the award will not vest if the groups growth in annual earnings per share does not exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% between the end of the 2005 financial year and the end of the 2007 financial year.
This part of the award will vest in full if the growth in the groups annual earnings per share exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 14% over the same period.
Between these points, this part of the award will vest pro rata on a straight line basis.
The remaining 690,000 options will vest subject to the achievement of individually set performance targets based on the following: 50% of the award will be subject to the overall pro t targets of the business under the employees control or targeted integration bene ts: 25% of the award will be subject to the continued employment of these key managers: and 25% of the award will be subject to acceptable attrition gures.
One half of the shares may be transferred as soon as practicable after 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007.
Unilog Plan Following the acquisition of Unilog on 13 January 2006, the company entered into liquidity agreements with most of the option holders in Unilog.
Under the liquidity agreement, outstanding options in Unilog will, upon exercise, be converted into shares in LogicaCMG plc, using a transfer ratio of 31.97 LogicaCMG plc shares for every one Unilog share.
Under IFRS 2, any amendment of the original terms and conditions of share options is fide ned as a modi cation and the portion of the original fair value charge not yet expensed should continue to be accrued over the period from modi cation to the vesting date.
If the modi cation increases the fair value of the options, the difference between the fair value of the original options and the modi ed options, both measured as at the date of modi cation, should be expensed over the period from modi cation to the vesting date.
The incremental increase in fair value after the modi cation to be expensed in the period up to the vesting date was 4.2 million.
The date of modi cation was 6 April 2006.
The calculation of the 4.2 million modi cation charge was made in two stages.
First the fair value of the options prior to modi cation was recalculated as at the date of modi cation, using the assumptions prevailing on that date, i. e. 6 April 2006.
The fair value of the options was measured using the intrinsic value of the options the share price at acquisition of 73 less the exercise price of each option.
Stage two of the calculation was to fair-value the options directly after 6 April 2006 using the Black-Scholes model.
The difference between the two calculations represents the incremental increase in fair value of 4.2 million to be expensed from 6 April 2006 to the vesting date.
The fair value of the original Unilog options at the date of grant and the modi cation date and the modi ed options measure at the date of modi cation were as follows: Date of modi cation Original Original Unilog Unilog Modi ed Weighted average assumption options options options Share price 29.88 51.05 1.93 Exercise price 29.82 29.82 0.93 Share options awards 427,028 389,777 12,461,171 Vesting period years 4.80 2.71 Expected volatility % 20.0 36.0 Expected life years 4.80 2.71 Risk-free rate % 4.2 4.4 Dividend yield % 1.0 2.9 Fair value per share option award 6.90 21.23 1.00 The share price, exercise price and fair value of the original Unilog options in the table above have been translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the date of acquisition of 1.46 to 1.
The share price, exercise price and fair value of the original Unilog options at the date of modi cation have been translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the date of modi cation of 1.43 to 1.
