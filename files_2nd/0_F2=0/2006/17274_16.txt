Notes to the Group Accounts Accounting Policies for the Year Ended 28 January 2006 The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
An explanation is provided where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements of the Group are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January.
The financial year for 2006 represents the 52 weeks ended 28 January.
The comparative financial year for 2005 was the 52 weeks ended 29 January 2005.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union, together with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Transition to IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 28 January 2006 are the first annual financial statements that comply with IFRS.
Woolworths Groups transition date is 1 February 2004.
The Groups IFRS adoption date is 30 January 2005.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has applied the mandatory exceptions and certain of the optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS.
a Exemption from restatement of comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group elected to apply this exemption.
It applies previous UK GAAP rules to derivatives, financial assets and financial liabilities and to hedging relationships for the 2005 comparative information.
b Share-based payment transaction exemption The Group has not applied this exemption.
Accordingly, it has applied IFRS 2 to all transactions since the Groups demerger in August 2001. c Business combinations The Group has applied the business combinations exemptions in IFRS 1.
It has not restated business combinations that took place before the transition date.
d Fair value or revaluation as deemed cost The Group has chosen to take the first time adoption exemption available under IFRS 1 to use a previous revaluation for an item of property, plant and equipment as its deemed cost at the transition date.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
The joint venture has been proportionately consolidated.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The Group has used both the purchase and merger methods of accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Under the purchase method of accounting the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets acquired, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identiable assets acquired and liabilities are measured initially at their fair values.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Under the merger method of accounting the consolidated financial statements incorporate the combined companies results as if the companies had always been combined, with no restatement of assets and liabilities other than for a harmonisation of accounting policies.
Any differences arising on consolidation under merger accounting are included in the Group financial statements as a merger reserve.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant inuence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups share of its associates post acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Joint Ventures Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities in which the Group has an interest.
The Groups interests in joint ventures are accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
The Group combines its share of the joint ventures individual income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash ows on a line by line basis with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 33 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Revenue Recognition Revenue represents the amounts receivable by the Group for goods and services supplied to customers, net of discounts and adjustments for returns and VAT, with this recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying products and services have been substantially transferred to the customer.
Revenue arising on the sale of credit vouchers represents third-party commission arising on these transactions.
The face value of vouchers issued is accounted for as a financial instrument under IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Prior to the adoption of these standards the face value of issued vouchers was accounted for as revenue, with a corresponding redemption liability created against cost of goods sold.
Licensing royalties are recognised as revenue when the following criteria are met: the licence agreement has been executed by all parties: the licence term has commenced: the collection of licence royalties is reasonably assured.
All licence royalties received in advance are included within deferred income until the above criteria are met.
Other Income Other income, including sales commission, is recognised on an accruals basis to match the provision of the related goods or services.
Net interest income is recognised on a time-apportioned basis.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Foreign Currencies The functional and the presentational currency of the Group is pounds Sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into Sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied.
Dividend Payment Policy Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Exceptional Items Items that are both material in size, unusual and infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement.
The Directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Groups underlying business performance.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group share of the net identiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Intangible Assets Brands are stated at cost less amortisation, with amortisation on a straight-line basis over 20 years.
Underlying rights are stated at fair value at acquisition less amortisation, with amortisation on a straight-line basis over ten years.
Purchased copyrights and licences are stated at cost less amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the underlying legal agreements, which typically range from five to 10 years.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
Incremental employee costs that are directly associated with the production of identiable and unique software controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benets exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software is amortised over five years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment based on the ongoing benefit derived from their use, with provision made where required.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is provided where it is necessary to reect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Group.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated by the straight-line method and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are: Land and buildings Freeholds 2 per cent Long leaseholds 5 per cent Short leaseholds over the life of the lease Fixtures, ttings and equipment Tenants improvements shorter of ten years and the remaining life of the lease Fixtures and ttings between 10 per cent and 15 per cent Computers and electronic equipment between 20 per cent and 50 per cent Motor cars 25 per cent 1 Commercial vehicles 33 3 per cent The Group has adopted a policy of not revaluing freehold properties.
The assets carrying value and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 34 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Disposal of Land and Buildings profits and losses on the disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts or where the completion cannot be reasonably withheld.
Finance Leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as xed assets and depreciated in accordance with the policy for the class of asset concerned.
The resulting lease obligations are included in creditors net of finance charges.
Interest costs on finance leases are charged to the income statement.
Operating Leases Operating lease payments, including xed rental uplifts, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Lease incentives are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-down and shrinkage.
Obsolescence and mark-down provisions against stocks identied as residual to the business are calculated by reference to the tracking of historic recovery rates.
Shrinkage provisions are calculated by reference to the stock loss rates derived from the store and distribution centre stock count programmes.
Rebates Receivable from Suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
This provision represents the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits at call with banks, other liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, bank overdrafts and unpresented cheques.
Bank overdrafts where there is no right of set off are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, with any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, where it is more likely than not that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise onerous lease costs and employee termination payments.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Current Taxation The taxation charge for current tax is based on the results for the year, as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred Taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Pensions All employees are entitled to join the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme WGPS after completion of one years service.
The WGPS is a dened benefit pension scheme.
The Company also facilitates a Stakeholder pension arrangement for employees and makes contributions to a dened contribution pension scheme the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust, which was closed to new entrants in June 2003 and currently has 122 active members.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the WGPS is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of scheme assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximate to the terms of the pension liability.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full over the period in which they occur, but outside of the profit and loss account, via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses SORIE.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 35 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Share-based Payments The Company no longer grants share options under its Executive Share Option Schemes.
Instead, Share Awards are made to senior management which vest dependent in part on performance targets being met.
A Savings Related Share Option, which is open to all UK employees, continues to operate.
The fair value of all share-based payments is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in the income statement reserve over the vesting period.
The proceeds received on the exercise of share options, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to the share capital and share premium accounts.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are shown as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
ESOP The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust.
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
The purchase or sales of shares in the trust are accounted for as treasury share transactions and are shown as movements in retained earnings.
Financial Risk Management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, market interest rates and debt market prices, counter-party credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments.
In addition other instruments are used to manage the Groups interest rate exposure.
The Board of Directors has approved a Group Treasury Policy that sets out the financial risk management policies applied by the Group.
A central Group Treasury function manages the Groups financial risk in accordance with this policy, receiving regular information including forecast information from all the operating companies in the Group to prompt identication of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
A procedures manual is maintained that reects this policy and sets out specic guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, counter-party credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments.
a Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks against Sterling primarily on transactions in US dollars.
It enters into forward currency contracts to hedge the cash ows of its product sourcing operation ie it buys US dollars forward in exchange for Sterling and looks forward 12 months on a rolling basis at forecasted purchase volumes.
The policy framework requires hedging between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of anticipated import purchases that are denominated in US dollars.
All of the forward contracts entered into by the Group qualied as highly probable purchases for which hedge accounting was used.
b Interest rate risk The Group has a seasonal cash ow that moves between net cash and net debt in the course of each year.
Underlying this, the Group has in issue a 100 million Bond repayable in November 2006 97.8 million net of fees in issue at the year-end.
This Bond was issued at xed rates of interest, with all remaining borrowings excluding finance leases and deposits of cash at oating rates of interest.
The Group has used an interest rate swap as a cash ow hedge of future interest payments related to part of the Bond principal that has the effect of increasing the proportion of the Groups oating interest rate debt.
This swap was arranged to achieve a greater balance between xed rate and oating rate interest expense and also to achieve a better balance between oating rate interest expense and oating rate interest income for the Group.
The difference between the agreed xed rate of interest and the oating rate of interest under the swap arrangement is settled on a semi-annual basis, with 30 million of the principal amount of the Bond effectively swapped to oating rates.
c Counter-party credit risk The Group has some significant concentrations of credit risk within both the retail and entertainment segment.
Policies have been implemented that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence and on potential suppliers before orders can be raised.
Financial instrument and investment counter-parties are subject to pre-approval by the Board in accordance with Group Treasury policy.
Exposure to counter-parties is managed through a framework that limits amounts invested together with amounts contracted through financial instruments according to the counter-partys public credit rating.
d Liquidity risk The Group Treasury function is required to ensure the Group has sufficient committed debt facilities to cover its liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.
During the year, the Group entered into an amendment of its existing committed bank facilities increasing the amount committed to 250 million and extending the term.
At the year-end 250 million remained undrawn.
The amended facilities are sufficient to re-finance the 100 million Bond due in November 2006 and to cover the Groups projected remaining liquidity requirements for the next four years.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 36 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Derivative Financial Instruments From 1 February 2004 to 29 January 2005 Financial assets were recognised on the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premia were charged or credited to the income statement over the life of the asset or liability to which they related.
Derivative financial instruments were accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they were held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
Where such instruments did not hedge an underlying asset or liability, they were accounted for using fair value accounting.
When a financial instrument ceased to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event was no longer likely to occur, the instrument was thereafter marked to its fair value in the financial statements.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments for hedging purposes was recognised on an accruals basis, and credited or charged to the income statement in the financial period in which it arose.
From 30 January 2005 onwards Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: a rm commitment fair value hedge : or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash ow hedge.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows of hedged items.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Cash ow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods in which the hedged items affect the income statement.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset for example, inventory or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
c Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivative instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting.
Such derivatives are classied as at fair value through the income statement, and changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair Value Estimation The fair values of short-term deposits, loans, and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
The fair value of the Groups 100 million Bond 30 million being the hedged item has been calculated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current rates referenced from the zero coupon market curve.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate swap the hedging instrument is calculated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current rates referenced from the zero coupon market curve.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of credit vouchers in issue is the face value of the instruments redeemable outside of the Group, that remain unredeemed and unextinguished at the balance sheet date.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 37 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 1.
Segmental Analysis The Group considers that business segmental analysis is its primary reporting basis.
The Groups business is divided into a Retail segment and an Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing segment.
Woolworths plc, Streets Online Limited, WMS Card Services Limited and Flogistics Limited are included within the Retail segment, with Entertainment UK Limited, Disc Distribution Limited and 2entertain Limited being the constituents of Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing.
MVC Entertainment Limited was disposed of on 30 July 2005 and is now shown as a discontinued operation.
No material trading is undertaken outside the UK and consequently no geographic segmentation has been shown.

The reorganisation of big W exceptional item includes net income from the disposal of leases and the reconguration of the out-of-town estate of 24.7 million 2005: 37.4 million cost, stock disposals and store clearance income of 6.0 million 2005: 17.3 million cost and other selling and administration costs of 2.6 million 2005: 6.0 million.
In addition the re-siting of two of the five distribution centres operated by Woolworths plc, together with related central reorganisation, generated 3.9 million of further exceptional restructuring costs in the year 2005: nil.
On the formation of 2entertain Limited, Woolworths Group agreed to guarantee a stipulated level of profitability for certain key VCI contracts in the event that any such contracts terminated during the three years to September 2007.
The potential liability had been disclosed previously as a maximum contingent liability for each year of 3.9 million.
No cost was incurred in respect of the first year of this guarantee, but based on the latest review of performance a provision of 5.2 million has been recognised in respect of the second and third years.
The Group concluded the sale of MVC Entertainment Limited to a group of retail investors on 30 July 2005 for a cash consideration of 5.5 million.
The pre-tax exceptional item relating to this discontinued operation is 28.3 million, which consists of a 25.6 million loss on disposal of the business after deducting the 5.5 million proceeds, and providing for stock losses, and 2.7 million of costs associated with the closure of a number of MVC stores before completion of the disposal.
The tax effect of these operating exceptional items in aggregate is a 4.6 million charge 2005: 14.4 million credit, of which a 6.9 million charge relates to the continuing exceptional and a 2.3 million credit relates to the discontinued exceptional.
The cash effect of the operating exceptional items is a 31.6 million inow in the period 2005: 3.1 million outow, of which a 30.9 million inow relates to the continuing exceptional and a 0.7 million inow relates to the discontinued exceptional.

The cash was paid following completion.
In addition there was a 2.6 million cash outow from the exceptional store closure programme undertaken prior to this sale, and a further cash outow of 2.2 million from disposal costs.
The store closure programme and the subsequent sale of MVC has created an exceptional loss after taxation of 26.0 million.
On disposal of MVC an agreement was entered into with the acquirer to transfer to Woolworths Group a pro-rated share of the benefit of tax losses for the year ended 28 January 2006 based on the relevant period of ownership of the company.
MVC has subsequently entered into administration and so only 0.5 million of the potential benefit of these tax losses has been recognised given the uncertainty over their recovery.

Earnings per Share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares including shares held by a trust which are accounted for as treasury shares see note 29.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has only one category of dilutive potential shares share options.
For the share options, a calculation is undertaken to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
Adjusted Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items, the amortisation of underlying rights included within intangible assets and the xed rental uplift adjustment arising from the introduction of IFRS.

Exceptional impairment costs have arisen from a review of the carrying value of xed assets following the reconguration of the Woolworths out-of-town estate.
During the year ended 28 January 2006 the Group revised the useful economic lives of certain computers and electronic equipment.
This revision reduced the depreciation charge for the year by 0.8 million.
In addition, in the year ended 29 January 2005 the economic lives of tenant improvements were adjusted from the shorter of five years and the remaining life of the stores lease to the shorter of ten years and the remaining life of the store lease.
The effect of this revision was a decrease in depreciation charge for the year of 3.1 million.

Guarantees arising on joint venture A provision of 5.2 million has been recognised in respect of payments expected to arise as a result of guarantees established on the formation of 2entertain Limited see note 6.
Onerous property contracts Within the onerous property contracts provision, the Group has provided against future liabilities for all long-term idle properties and properties sublet at a shortfall.
The provision is based on the discounted value of future cash outows relating to rent, rates and service charges based on the remaining period of the leases, which at 28 January 2006 range between one and 11 years.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30 per cent 2005: 30 per cent.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same scal authority.

Share options Under the Executive Share Option Schemes, participants were granted options on a half-yearly basis depending on their position in the Group.
The option exercise price was the market price at the time of the grant.
Subject to the attainment of performance targets, options are capable of exercise after at least three years and within ten years of the date of grant.
For options granted after September 2001, the performance target is growth in Earnings Per Share EPS as dened in the relevant scheme rules.
For full vesting, EPS must increase by a minimum of 6 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
There is a facility for one retest at the fourth anniversary of grant.
No further options have been granted since 25 March 2004.
Under the ShareSave Plan, eligible UK employees can enter into an Inland Revenue approved savings contract for a period of three years whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option exercise price is the average market price over three days shortly before an offer is made.
No discount has been applied and the options are exercisable within a six-month period from the date the savings contract matures.
The rules of the Executive Share Option Schemes and ShareSave Plan include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.

Contingent Liabilities On the formation of 2entertain Limited, Woolworths Group agreed to guarantee a stipulated level of profitability for certain key VCI contracts in the event that any such contracts terminated during a period of three years to September 2007.
No liability was incurred in respect of year one and a provision of 5.2 million has been recognised in respect of years two and three, against a potential maximum exposure for the two remaining years of 7.8 million.
Based on results to date no further provision is required, however the future performance of these contracts is uncertain.
In common with a number of retailers Woolworths Group has challenged HM Revenue & Customs on the recoverability of VAT on merchant services.
Following the Court of Appeal decision in July 2005 no repayment will arise to the Group.
Certain matters relating to merchant services remain to be resolved, but based on advice taken, it is considered that no material liability will be incurred.
However this is not certain.
As at the balance sheet date no provision has been made.
Capital and Other Financial Commitments Capital commitments Capital commitments contracted but not provided for by the Group amounted to nil 2005: nil.

Reconciliation of Net Assets and profit Under UK GAAP to IFRS continued Explanation of reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS for the year ended 29 January 2005 The main differences arising between UK GAAP and IFRS for the year ended 29 January 2005 are as follows: a Pensions In the year ended 29 January 2005 the Group continued to adopt the transitional arrangements allowed under FRS 17 and accounted for pension costs under SSAP 24, charging the estimated costs of pensions in respect of the dened benefit scheme to the profit and Loss Account so that they were spread across the working lives of employees.
The assets and obligations of this scheme were not recognised in the Group Balance Sheet.
Adoption of IAS 19 has required the Group to recognise the present value of the dened benefit obligation, together with the fair value of scheme assets.
The pension cost therefore now reects the pension service cost for employees, together with the interest cost arising on the pension scheme obligations and the return on scheme assets.
Actuarial gains or losses on scheme obligations and assets are taken directly to equity.
b Operating lease incentives Under UK GAAP lease incentives were generally deferred and taken to profit across the period to the first rent review.
However, under IFRS these incentives have to be recognised across the entire lease term on a straight-line basis in accordance with SIC 15 issued by the Standard Interpretations Committee.
c Fixed rental adjustment Lease costs were recognised under UK GAAP in line with the current rental charge, even where there were future xed or minimum rental uplifts in the lease agreements, as this was deemed to more appropriately align the lease costs with the benets of occupancy.
The IFRIC pronouncement in September 2005 requires the total minimum payments across the entire lease term to be recognised on a straight-line basis across the life of the lease.
d Share-based payments Under UK GAAP the charge recognised in respect of share-based payments, including share options, was based on the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the date of issue.
The charge under IFRS 2 is based on the fair value of the share award, with this recognised in the income statement across the vesting period with a corresponding reversal in the retained earnings reserve.
e Holiday pay accrual IFRS requires the recognition of timing differences between the number of days holiday accrued by employees and the number of days taken.
f Foreign exchange accounting Under UK GAAP forward contracts to purchase foreign exchange were accounted for under the one-transaction approach, with the contracted rate applied to related stock purchases and therefore recognised in the profit and Loss Account when the product was sold.
This one transaction approach is not permitted under IAS 21, with foreign currency denominated transactions recognised at the rate applicable on intake and the monetary liability retranslated at each subsequent balance sheet date.
Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 30 January 2005 has subsequently permitted hedge accounting of these contracts if certain criteria are achieved.
g Amortisation of goodwill and intangibles Goodwill arising on a business combination is amortised under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS there is no amortisation of goodwill, with annual impairment reviews instead required under IAS 36.
However, IFRS 3 requires intangible assets arising from legal or other contractual rights that are separable from the business to be identied and valued on acquisition of a business.
Intangible assets are then amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
UK GAAP is not as stringent as IFRS with regard to identifying intangibles, with some separately identied assets under IFRS subsumed within goodwill when accounting for a business combination under UK GAAP.
h Gain on formation of joint venture The gain arising on the disposal of a 60 per cent interest in a subsidiary for a 40 per cent share in a joint venture was deemed to be unrecognised under UK GAAP and therefore taken through the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses rather than the profit and Loss Account.
This gain is reected in the income statement under IFRS, but has been reduced to reect a reversal of the goodwill amortisation charge against the disposed business that had been charged under UK GAAP between the IFRS transition date and disposal.
An impairment adjustment was made on transition to reect the accumulated amortisation that had been recognised under UK GAAP at that date.
i Taxation In accordance with IAS 12 a provision has been made for deferred tax on revalued assets, with this only permitted under UK GAAP if there was a binding commitment to sell the assets.
Deferred tax has also been recognised on the re-categorisation of goodwill arising on the acquisition of intangible assets and the corporation tax impact of all the adjustments to income and equity required under IFRS has been recognised.
j Dividends Under UK GAAP companies were required to provide for proposed final dividends in advance of the dividends being declared and approved by an Annual General Meeting.
Under IAS 37, a proposed dividend does not represent a liability and therefore dividends are only recognised when declared and approved.
Explanation of material adjustments to the cash ow statement for the year ended 29 January 2005 The cash ow under IFRS includes the proportional consolidation of cash ows of joint ventures, rather than the dividend receipts from joint venture undertakings recognised under UK GAAP.
Income taxes of 15.6 million 14.2 million excluding share of joint venture paid during the year ended 29 January 2005 are classied as a part of operating cash ows under IFRS, but were included in a separate category of tax cash ows under UK GAAP.
Cash and cash equivalents includes short-term deposits of 0.2 million under IFRS, under UK GAAP these have been included in the management of liquid resources category.
There are no other material differences between the cash ow statement presented under IFRS and the cash ow statement presented under UK GAAP.
Explanation of movements from previous notications of IFRS adjustments The adjustments set out above are those that were notied to investors in presentations made in September 2005 and sent to shareholders with the interim financial statements, other than for the following amendments: a Fixed rental adjustment As noted above, the IFRIC pronouncement in September 2005 has required a change to the previously announced treatment of lease agreements with future xed or minimum rental uplifts, with a related adjustment to the taxation charge.
b Credit voucher sales Under IFRS the turnover recognised on the sale of credit vouchers redeemable at third-party retailers is the commission arising on these transactions, rather than the face value of the vouchers issued that is recognised under UK GAAP.
Revenue and cost of goods sold have been restated accordingly.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 65 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 37.
Reconciliation of Net Assets and profit Under UK GAAP to IFRS continued c Pensions The final IFRS pensions analysis provided by Hewitt included a reallocation of 0.9 million in respect of service expenses for the year ended 29 January 2005 from the pension service cost to the pension funding cost.
d Returns provision Under UK GAAP the provision for anticipated returns was reected within trade and other receivables, with the value attributed to the returned product recognised within inventories.
The net liability has been recognised within accruals under IFRS.
e Revaluation reserve The exemption taken under IFRS 1 to use previous revaluations of property, plant and equipment as deemed cost has required the reclassication of the revaluation reserve under UK GAAP as retained earnings.
f Other adjustments The deferred tax asset and liability have been offset to recognise a net debtor, as offset of balances within the same tax jurisdiction is allowed.
In addition a review of proportional consolidation of 2entertain Limited has resulted in a reallocation of 3.8 million between trade and other payables and current taxation in respect of the corporation tax liability.
