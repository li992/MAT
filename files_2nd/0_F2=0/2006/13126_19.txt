62 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS e. Retirement benefit schemes The Redrow Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme comprises two sections: a funded, self-administered, defined benefits section and a funded defined contribution section, the former of which is contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme.
Actuarial gains and losses relating to the defined benefit scheme are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with IAS 19 Revised.
The total pension charge for the year was 6.9m 2005: 3.0m 5.7m of which related to the defined benefit section of the scheme 2005: 2.0m, with 2.9m being charged to the income statement 2005: 2.7m and 2.8m being charged to the statement of recognised income and expense 2005: credit of 0.7m.
The charge arising from the defined contribution section was 1.2m 2005: 1.0m.
Triennial valuation A full independent triennial actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was undertaken at 1 July 2005.
The method used was the Projected Unit Method.
The main assumptions were an investment return of 4.89% per annum compound, salary increase of 5.7% per annum compound, and mortality in accordance with the PA92 series of tables.
In the opinion of the Actuary, there was a deficit of 11.5m in the defined benefit section of the Scheme, with the value of the Scheme's assets representing 78% of the Scheme's liabilities.
As at 1 July 2005 the value of the defined benefit section of the Scheme's assets was 41.5m.
The previous triennial valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2003 and reported a deficit of 2.2m.
The pension scheme year end was amended subsequent to 1 January 2003 to coincide with the Groups year end of 30 June.
Defined Benefit Scheme IAS 19 valuation Redrow has elected to adopt the December 2004 amendments to IAS 19 as encouraged by the IASB.
In particular, Redrow has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit plan in the period in which they occur, outside the income statement, in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
This disclosure relates to the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
The Schemes assets are held separately from the assets of Redrow and are administered by the trustees and managed professionally.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was carried out at 1 July 2005.
This valuation has been updated to 30 June 2006 by a qualified actuary for the purposes of these accounts.
Company contributions for the next financial year are expected to be approximately 11m.
This estimate includes a special contribution of 8m which was paid in July 2006, following a special contribution of 3m which was paid in June 2006.
63 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The major financial assumptions used by the Actuary were: 30 June 2006 June 2005 Long-term rate of increase in pensionable salaries 6.1% 5.7% 1 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 5% per annum and RPI 3.0% 2.7% 2 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 2.5% per annum and RPI 2.2% N A Discount rate 5.24% 4.89% Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.7% Expected return on assets 6.8% 6.14% 1 In respect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned prior to 30 June 2006 2 In respect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned after 30 June 2006.
Other pension increases are valued in a consistent manner.
The expected return on assets assumption has been derived by considering the appropriate return for each of the main asset classes listed below.
The yields assumed on bond type investments are based on published redemption yields at the balance sheet date.
The assumed return on equities reflects an assumed allowance for the out-performance of these asset classes over UK Government bonds in the long term.
The rates of return are shown net of investment manager expenses.
The mortality tables used in the actuarial valuation were making allowance for projected further improvements in mortality : For male members: PMA92C2020 adjusted for projected further improvements in mortality For female members: PFA92C2020 adjusted for projected further improvements in mortality 64 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The total assets, the split between the major asset classes in the schemes, the present value of the schemes liabilities, and the amounts recognised in the balance sheet are shown below: The Group and Company Value at Value at 30 June 2006 30 June 2005 m m Equities excluding shares held in Redrow plc 38.6 31.1 Gilts 10.0 8.6 Redrow plc shares 1.2 1.0 Cash 3.3 0.1 Insurance policies 1.5 0.9 Total market value of assets 54.6 41.7 Present value of obligations 63.2 49.6 Deficit in the Scheme 8.6 7.9 Net liability 8.6 7.9 The total amounts charged credited against income in the year were as follows: The Group and Company 2006 2005 m m Amounts included within the income statement: Periodic operating costs Current service cost 3.0 2.4 Financing costs Expected return on assets 2.6 2.2 Interest cost 2.5 2.5 2.9 2.7 Amounts recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE : Actuarial losses gains 2.8 0.7 5.7 2.0 Cumulative amount of losses and gains recognised in the SORIE since 1 July 2004 2.1 0.7 65 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the deficit in respect of the Groups defined benefit section is as follows: The Group and Company 2006 2005 m m At 1 July 2005 7.9 7.9 Amounts charged against recognised income and expense 5.7 2.0 Employer contributions paid 5.0 2.0 At 30 June 2006 8.6 7.9 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation: At 1 July 2005 49.6 41.7 Current service cost 3.0 2.4 Past service cost - - Interest cost 2.5 2.5 Member contributions 1.0 1.0 Benefit payments, group life insurance death in service 0.7 0.8 premiums and administration costs Actuarial losses on liabilities 7.8 2.8 At 30 June 2006 63.2 49.6 Changes in the fair value of the Schemes assets: At 1 July 2005 41.7 33.8 Special contributions 3.0 - Normal employer contributions 2.0 2.0 Member contributions 1.0 1.0 Expected return on assets 2.6 2.2 Benefit payments, group life insurance death in service 0.7 0.8 premiums and administration costs Actuarial gain on assets 5.0 3.5 At 30 June 2006 54.6 41.7 The actual return on the plan assets was 7.6m.

c. Amounts due in respect of development land Group policy permits land purchases to be made on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39, the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value using the effective interest method.
The difference between the fair value and nominal value is amortised over the deferment period via financing costs, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The interest rate used for each deferred payment is an equivalent loan rate available on the date of the land purchase, as applicable to a loan lasting for a comparable period to that of the deferment.
The maturity profile of amounts due in respect of development land is as below: The Group 2006 2005 m m Due within one year 36.4 31.6 Due between one and two years 18.5 19.4 Due between two and five years 23.4 27.8 78.3 78.8 d. Credit risk The Group's credit risk is mainly attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Group's management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position of its debtors.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of customers.
e. Fair values At 30 June 2006 there is no material difference between the fair value of financial instruments and their carrying values as shown in the balance sheet.
