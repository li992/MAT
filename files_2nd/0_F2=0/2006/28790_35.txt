60 Notes to the Financial Statements 15.
DEFERRED TAX ASSET CONTINUED The Company has investments in several offshore hedge funds which have an aggregate market value of 117.8 million as at 31 March 2006.
The original cost of these investments was 73.2 million and the Company considers that the taxable profits which will be subsequently generated by the realisation of these investments will be greater than the amount of its revenue tax losses.
Accordingly, the Company considers that it is appropriate to recognise the deferred tax asset in its financial statements.
The dealing subsidiary has tax losses amounting to 28.9 million at 31 March 2006 31 March 2005: 10.9 million.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses because of uncertainty as to the timing and magnitude of future taxable profits arising from the same trade.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of potential deferred tax on temporary timing differences associated with the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 0.6 million 31 March 2005: 3.3 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
