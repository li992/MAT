Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
General information Britvic plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
Britvic plc and its subsidiaries together the Group operate in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom.
On the 14 December 2005, the ordinary share capital of Britvic plc was admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities.
The operating companies of the Group are disclosed within note 31.
Statement of compliance The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable IFRS, including relevant International Accounting Standards IAS, Standing Interpretations Committee SIC and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
These include IFRS adopted by the EU and those awaiting formal endorsement, as applicable to the 2006 financial statements.
As permitted, the Group has also early adopted the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits published in December 2004.
The Group adopted IFRS for the first time in the current year and therefore IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards has been applied in preparing this financial information.
The Group has taken the following exemptions available under IFRS 1: a Not to restate the comparative information disclosed in the 2005 financial statements being the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2005 in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
b Not to restate business combinations occurring before 4 October 2004. c To recognise all actuarial gains and losses on pensions and other post-retirement benefits directly in shareholders equity at 4 October 2004. d Not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to grants of equity instruments on or before 7 November 2002 that had vested prior to 1 January 2005.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1, reconciling financial statements previously published under UK GAAP to IFRS, are given in notes 32, 33 and 34.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained in note 3.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million except where otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation For all periods up to and including the year ended 2 October 2005, Britannia Soft Drinks Limited prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP.
As a consequence of the acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited by Britvic plc and of that companys listing on the London Stock Exchange, from 3 October 2005 the Group is required to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
These statements are therefore the first financial statements prepared by Britvic plc in accordance with IFRS and as such take account of the requirements and options in IFRS 1 as they relate to the 2005 comparatives included therein.
Britvic plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial information of Britvic plc and the entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 43 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation continued Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of Britvic plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 1 October 2006.
The acquisition method of accounting has been used, under which the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Britannia SD Holdings Limited was incorporated on 27 October 2005 and changed its name to Britvic plc on 21 November 2005.
Britvic plc is the entity whose shares are listed on the Official List of the Financial Services Authority and have been admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
The Britannia Soft Drinks Group became a subsidiary of Britannia SD Holdings Limited in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement dated 18 November 2005 for the transfer of the entire issued share capital of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited to Britannia SD Holdings Limited in consideration for the issue of fully paid up ordinary shares of Britannia SD Holdings Limited to existing shareholders.
This consideration was paid in proportion to the existing shareholders interests in Britannia Soft Drinks Limited.
Upon stamping of the relevant stock transfer forms, Britvic plc became the registered holder of the entire issued share capital of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited.
The group reorganisation between Britvic plc and the Britannia Soft Drinks Group was a transaction between the existing shareholders see note 21.
The share exchange has been accounted for using pooling of interest accounting principles since the new shareholders of the Company are the same as the former shareholders and the rights of each shareholder, relative to the others, are unchanged.
The consolidated financial statements are presented as if the share exchange had been effective on 3 October 2005.
Revenue recognition Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between wholly owned subsidiaries, and after deduction of sales related discounts, value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
Sales related discounts are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet claims by the Group's customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years Vehicles included in plant and machinery 5 to 7 years Equipment in retail outlets included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 to 10 years Other fixtures and fittings included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 10 years Land is not depreciated.
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over 50 years, or over the unexpired lease term when this is less than 50 years.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount, and are included in the income statement.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Accounting policies continued Goodwill Business combinations on or after 4 October 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement and positive goodwill is recognised on the balance sheet.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to the Group of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies by management.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalised at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives on a straight-line basis over a period appropriate to the assets useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Software costs Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 7 years.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 45 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial period-end.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group has financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables.
The Group measures these as follows: Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging Period ended 1 October 2006 The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
From 3 October 2005, such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Fair value hedges For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged: the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both are taken to profit or loss.
For hedged items carried at amortised cost, the adjustment is amortised through the income statement such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, this gives rise to an asset or liability in the balance sheet, representing the cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
Cash flow hedges For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a nonfinancial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued Period ended 2 October 2005 As the Group has opted not to adopt IAS 39 in the comparative periods, the accounting policy below relates to UK GAAP and is effective for the period to 2 October 2005.
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not use forward foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign currency contract to be treated as a hedge, the following criteria must be met: the instrument must be related to a contracted foreign currency commitment: it must involve the same currency as the hedged item: and it must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are not recognised until the transaction occurs.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to net interest income or expense over the period of the contract.
Derecognition of financial instruments The derecognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all the cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party.
Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares 'market conditions'.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfiled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 'vesting date'.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors and based on the best available estimate at that date, will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Taxation The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the year, after any adjustments in respect of prior years.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from accelerated capital allowances, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, provisions for share-based payments and employee profit share schemes and other short-term temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability will be settled.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 47 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Pensions The Group operates a pension scheme, the Britvic Pension Plan the Scheme, which has both a defined benefit fund and a defined contribution fund.
The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed on 1 August 2002, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join the defined contribution section of the scheme.
Under defined benefit pension plans, plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit method and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities.
The service cost of providing pension benefits to employees for the year is charged to the income statement.
The cost of making improvements to pensions is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period during which the increase in benefits vests.
To the extent that the improvements in benefits vest immediately, the cost is recognised immediately.
These costs are recognised as an expense.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the plan liabilities during the year is included within administrative expenses.
A credit representing the expected return on the plan assets during the year is included within administrative expenses.
This credit is based on the market value of the plan assets, and expected rates of return, at the beginning of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from: differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets: differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and actual experience during the year: or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable for the year are charged to the income statement as an operating expense.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future installments.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Lease incentives received are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they relate.
Accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful accounts.
An allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are stated at proceeds received less any unamortised issue costs.
Finance charges are charged to the income statement using an effective interest rate method.
Finance costs not settled in the period are included within the outstanding loan balance.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial information is presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group's functional and presentational currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the income statement.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products and services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Segment reporting reflects the internal management structure and the way the business is managed.
The Directors consider that the Group has only one reportable geographic segment and one business segment being the manufacture and sale of soft drinks.
The Directors consider that the risks and returns of the Groups products are similar in nature.
Issued share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Exceptional Items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those significant items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised as finance costs in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans The finance cost recognised in the income statement in respect of capital instruments is allocated to periods over the terms of the instrument using the effective interest method.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 49 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not applied The Group has not applied the following IFRSs and IFRIC Interpretations, which will be applicable to the Group, that have been issued but are not yet effective: Effective date, periods commencing International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS IFRS 6 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources 1 January 2007 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 International Accounting Standards IAS IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 21 Amendment The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendment Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: The Fair Value Option 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendment Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions 1 January 2006 IAS 39 IFRS 4 Amendment Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 4 Determination whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2006 IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds 1 January 2006 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specifically the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Those standards not mentioned above but issued recently have been considered by the Group and have no significant impact on the financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates and judgements in a number of areas.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing significant adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post retirement benefits The determination of the pension and other post retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Deferred income tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require managements judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised.
In particular, significant judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realised.
Change of accounting policy: Implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 As permitted by IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards the Group elected not to present comparative information in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Therefore in the comparative information for the year ended 2 October 2005, financial assets and liabilities are accounted for under UK GAAP.
The accounting treatment under UK GAAP for derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes is detailed in note 3.
From 3 October 2005 for IFRS all financial assets and financial liabilities have to be recognised initially at fair value.
In subsequent periods the measurement of these financial instruments depends on their classification.
At 3 October 2005 the Group had forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps outstanding in relation to anticipated future cash flows.
Hedges of cash flows have been valued using forward rates ruling at 3 October 2005.
The effects of adopting IAS 39 are shown as a restatement of the opening balance of reserves at 3 October 2005.
Should IAS 39 be applied as at 2 October 2005, the impact on the balance sheet as at that date would be as follows: m Decrease in reserves 1.0 Increase in current liabilities 1.2 Increase in current assets 0.2 5.
Exceptional items 2006 2005 m m Listing costs 5.5 5.8 Incentive schemes directly associated with the flotation 6.6 Restructuring costs 7.0 19.1 5.8 Finance costs see note 9 0.3 0.1 19.4 5.9 Listing costs relates to costs incurred in pursuit of the listing on the London Stock Exchange which include advisors fees.
Incentive schemes directly associated with the flotation include all-employee share schemes and management incentives.
Restructuring costs includes the costs of major restructuring programmes undertaken in the year.
These costs relate principally to redundancy costs and advisors fees.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent before deducting interest on the convertible non-cumulative redeemable preference shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 2006 2005 m m Basic earnings per share for reported earnings Net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 24.2 43.4 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for basic earnings per share 215.4 214.8 Basic earnings per share for profit 11.2p 20.2p Diluted earnings per share for reported earnings Net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 24.2 43.4 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for diluted earnings per share 216.7 214.8 Diluted earnings per share for profit 11.2p 20.2p 56 Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 11.
Earnings per share continued The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those significant items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
To this end, basic and diluted earnings per share is also presented on this basis using the weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts as per the table above.

Impairment test of goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated by senior management to 6 individual cash-generating units for impairment testing as follows: Orchid: Red Devil: Tango: Robinsons: Britvic Soft Drinks business: and Water Business.
The recoverable amount of these units has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five year period.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8 per cent and cash flows beyond the one year period are extrapolated using a growth rate in line with senior management expectations of growth.

Growth rates reflect senior management expectations of volume growth.
Discount rates reflect senior managements estimate of the cost of capital.
The estimated cost of capital is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
Budgeted marginal contribution financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to budgeted marginal contribution.
Advertising and promotional spend financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to advertising and promotional spend.
Raw materials price, production and distribution costs, selling costs and other overhead inflation the basis used to determine the value assigned to inflation is forecast consumer price indices of 2 per cent.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions There are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of these units to exceed their recoverable amount.

Issued share capital The Company was incorporated on 27 October 2005 with an authorised share capital of 655,000,000 divided into 6,550,000,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.0001 each.
5,829,810 ordinary shares were allotted to Six Continents Investments Limited, 2,914,904 ordinary shares were allotted to Whitbread Group PLC, 2,914,904 ordinary shares were allotted to Allied Domecq Overseas Canada Limited and 613,664 ordinary shares were allotted to Wotsits Brands Limited, all issued at par value of 0.0001 for cash.
As a result, issued share capital on incorporation comprised 12,273,282 ordinary shares totalling 1,227.
Since the date of incorporation, the following changes in share capital have occurred: On 18 November 2005 the Company acquired the entire share capital of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated 18 November 2005, in consideration of the issue to the shareholders of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited of 4,295,636,424,718 ordinary shares of 0.0001 each.
On 18 November 2005 the entire share capital was consolidated in a ratio of 1 for every 20,000 shares.
This resulted in a revised share capital of 214,782,435 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 2 each.
On 24 November 2005, the Companys share capital was reduced by a court-approved reduction of capital.
The share capital of 429,564,870 divided into 214,782,435 ordinary shares of 2 each was reduced to 214,782,435 ordinary shares of 0.20 each, thus creating distributable reserves of 386,608,383 in the Company.
There have been further smaller share issues relating to incentive schemes for employees.

Pensions The Group operates a pension scheme, the Britvic Pension Plan the Scheme, which has both a defined benefit fund and a defined contribution fund.
The funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid into the funds in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary.
The latest valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2004.
As a result of the full actuarial valuation at this date, further contributions of 30m were made in March and December 2005.
An annual contribution of 10m will be made in December 2006 to 2010 in order to eliminate the deficiency in the scheme arising at that time.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the defined contribution scheme in the income statement for 2006 was 1.3m 2005: 0.9m.
The principal assumptions used in determining pension and post-employment benefit obligations for the Groups plans are shown below: 2006 2005 % % Discount rate 5.00 5.00 Rate of compensation increase 4.50 4.30 Expected long term return on plan assets 6.34 6.95 Pension increases LPI 3.00 2.80 Inflation assumption 3.00 2.80 The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables known as PA92.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has been also included.
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Financial instruments The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
The board of Directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials and commercial assets in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group.
Such purchases are made in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
For the period ended 1 October 2006, the Group has hedged 70 per cent 2005:75 per cent of forecast exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being PET, sugar, cans and frozen concentrated orange juice.
Where it is considered commercially advantageous, the Group enters into fixed price contracts with suppliers to hedge against unfavourable commodity price changes.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest fluctuation.
At 1 October 2006, 100.0m 2005: 100.0m of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Under the transitional provisions permitted under IFRS, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption contained in IFRS 1 whereby on first-time adoption of IFRS there is no requirement to apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on transition.
Application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 2 October 2005 does not have a material impact on the Groups financial position or result.
The comparative information contained within this note has therefore been disclosed in accordance with that shown under UK GAAP whereas the current year information is shown under IFRS.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts.
The bank loans entered into by the Group are unsecured.
a Financial assets and liabilities under IFRS at 1 October 2006 Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 1 October 2006 by maturity date is as follows: Fixed rate Within More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m m Bank loans 100.0 100.0 Includes the effects of the related interest rate swaps on floating borrowings discussed below Floating rate Within More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m m Cash 19.2 19.2 Bank loans 17.5 184.3 201.8 Interest rate swap 0.5 0.5 Foreign currency contracts 1.0 1.0 See note 23 68 Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 26.
Financial instruments continued Floating rate continued Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.

Hedges Cash flow hedges At 1 October 2006, the Group held 25 US dollar and 58 Euro forward exchange contracts designated as hedges of expected future purchases from overseas suppliers in US dollars and Euros for which the Group believe to be highly probable transactions.
The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of these highly probable transactions.
The terms of these contracts are as follows: Maturity range Average exchange rate Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases US$7,084,000 31 Oct 06 to 28 Sept 07 US$1.81 EUR43,548,000 31 Oct 06 to 28 Sept 07 EUR1.48 The terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases within the 12 months of the balance sheet date have been assessed to be effective.
Interest rate hedges At 1 October 2006, the Group had an interest rate swap in place with a notional amount of 100.0m whereby it exchanges floating rate interest based on 6 month LIBOR for a fixed rate of interest of 4.83 per cent.
The swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings which they hedge.

Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Group, and include those arising on short-term debtors and creditors.
Financial instruments continued Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to minimise the currency exposures that arise on purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedge position matures.
The Group had forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currency as follows: 2005 Euro m 36.5 US dollar $m 11.8 All contracts entered into mature within 12 months of the period end.
Unrecognised gains and losses on financial instruments used for hedging are as follows: 2005 m Unrecognised gains 0.1 Unrecognised losses 0.4 Net unrecognised losses 0.3 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The book values of the Groups recognised financial assets and liabilities are not materially different to their fair values.

Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 1 October 2006 is 6.9m 2005: 4.4m.
All of that expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3 per cent of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 75 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award provided they are employed by the Company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 were as follows: No of shares Annual free shares award 957,953 Matching shares award 1 free share for every ordinary share purchased 347,212 Special free shares award after flotation 915,408 Special matching shares award 2 free shares for every ordinary share purchased 339,952 The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan The Option Plan allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the market price of Britvic plcs shares on the business day before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7 per cent per annum over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3 per cent per annum in excess of RPI growth, 40 per cent of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the Company, an optionholder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
The following table illustrates the movements in the number of share options during the year.
Weighted average Number of exercise share price options pence Outstanding as at 3 October 2005 Granted during the year 1,644,828 245.0 Forfeited during the year 62,199 245.0 Exercised during the year Expired during the year Outstanding at 1 October 2006 1,582,629 245.0 Exercisable at 1 October 2006 The share options outstanding as at 1 October 2006 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 9.2 years and had an exercise price of 245.0p.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 40.4p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards granted to members of the senior leadership team are subject to a performance condition which measures the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group consisting of 22 other companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the Companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 40 per cent will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting at upper quartile.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team will be subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7 per cent pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3 per cent pa in excess of RPI growth, 40 per cent of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In addition, a transitional award has been made to members of both the senior leadership team and the senior management team shortly after flotation, at levels varying according to seniority.
These awards will vest in tranches over a period of up to three years, subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
The performance condition requires the Companys Return on Invested Capital ROIC to be at least 17 per cent over the performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 15 per cent over the performance period, 50 per cent of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the Company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.

As a result of the Companys flotation, the performance condition relating to options granted in 2004 and 2005 was changed and the number of options which vested was determined.
These options will remain exercisable until 13 June 2009.
Options granted in earlier years became exercisable on the satisfaction of their respective three year performance conditions and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.

It remains liable for rentals due to the landlord for any defaults on the part of these tenants.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount or timing of rentals that may default.
However, the Directors do not expect that any potential default would result in a material claim against the Group.

5.1m of revalued leasehold land classified as a finance lease under UK GAAP has been reclassified as an operating lease under IFRS.
b The revaluation reserve recognised under UK GAAP has been reclassified as other reserves under IFRS, as the Group has elected, under IFRS 1, to retain UK GAAP carrying values of property, plant and equipment including revaluations as deemed cost at transition.
c IFRS 2 requires the fair value of option and share awards to be charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
The fair value is determined at the date of grant using an appropriate pricing model.
The Group have elected to take the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 2 to grants of equity instruments on or before 7 November 2002 that had vested prior to 1 January 2005. d Pension liabilities increased by 0.6m net of deferred tax under IFRS because the method of valuing pension scheme assets differs from UK GAAP.
Deferred tax assets of 32.5m which were netted off against the related pension liabilities under UK GAAP are now included within the deferred tax headings on the face of the balance sheet.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 77 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 32.
Reconciliation of equity at 4 October 2004 date of transition to IFRS continued e Adjustments to deferred tax relate to the recognition of: i A deferred tax asset of 1.5m relating to the previous downward revaluation of qualifying buildings.
This has been credited to other reserves.
ii A deferred tax asset of 0.2m relating to share options granted to employees under IFRS.
iii A deferred tax liability of 2.0m relating to the upward revaluation of certain land under IFRS.
iv The reclassification of the deferred tax asset of 32.4m relating to the pension liability which is netted against the pension liability under UK GAAP, and the reclassification of the resulting deferred tax asset to non-current assets.
f Under UK GAAP, dividends are recognised as an expense in the period to which they relate.
Under IFRS, dividends are recognised as an appropriation of reserves in the period in which they are authorised.
Therefore the final proposed dividend for the period ended 4 October 2004 is reversed under IFRS, as it was not approved until after the balance sheet date.

Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.
ii Under IFRS, a liability is recognised for wages and salaries costs accrued in respect of untaken holiday at the balance sheet date.
iii IFRS 2 requires the fair value of option and share awards to be charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
The Group have elected to take the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 2 to grants of equity instruments on or before 7 November 2002 that had vested prior to 1 January 2005. iv Under IFRS certain leasehold land is reclassified as being held under an operating lease rather than a finance lease.
The associated lease premium is reclassified as a prepayment and is released to the income statement over the term of the associated lease.
v Under IFRS, the expected return on pension scheme assets net of interest cost on the benefit obligation is reclassified as an administrative expense.
b The expected return on pension scheme assets is lower under IFRS than UK GAAP, because the method of valuing pension scheme assets differs from UK GAAP.
The resulting expected return on pension scheme assets net of interest cost on the benefit obligation is a net cost of 1.2m which is reclassified as an administrative expense under IFRS.
In the opinion of the Directors this net cost should be classified in the same profit and loss heading as the other pension expenses.
c i A deferred tax charge of 320,000 is recognised under IFRS in relation to taxation on the amortisation of intangibles purchased post April 2002, which continues to be deductible for tax purposes but is not amortised for accounting purposes under IFRS.
ii Under IFRS, the deferred tax charge in relation to the expected return on pension scheme assets is 30,000 lower compared to UK GAAP.
iii Deferred income tax is recognised under IFRS in relation to certain revalued land 14,000, share options granted to employees 23,000 and holiday pay accrued for untaken holiday 196,000.
Explanation of material adjustments to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows There are no material differences between the statement of cash flows prepared under IFRS and the cash flow statement prepared under UK GAAP.
