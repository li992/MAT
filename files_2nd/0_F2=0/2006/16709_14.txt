The address of its registered office is Victrex Technology Centre, Hillhouse International, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, FY5 4QD, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2006 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Group's interest in the Japanese joint venture.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 4 December 2006.
B Ba as siis s o of f p pr re ep pa ar ra at tiio on n These results are the first to be published under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The main effects of the transition from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP to IFRS were set out in our 2005 Annual Report and are detailed in note 25 to the financial statements.
The restated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2005 and the opening balance sheet at 1 October 2004 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 October 2004 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the IFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards exemption whereby IFRS 3 - Business Combinations can be applied prospectively from the date of transition, hence removing the need to restate previous business combinations.
In addition, Victrex has also taken advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption to deem as zero at the date of transition to IFRS the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations.
Share option arrangements granted before 7 November 2002 exist.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 - Share-based Payment have not been applied to these grants in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued during the period which are not yet effective, and accordingly the Group has not yet adopted.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not deemed to be significant.
IIn nv five es st tm me en nt ts s In the Company's accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings and Victrex-MC, Inc are stated at cost less any impairment in the value of the investment.
B Ba as siis s o of f c co on ns so olliid da at tiio on n S Su ub bs siid diia ar riie es s Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.

Certain key management decisions require the co-operation of both parties.
The Group's share of profits less losses of the Japanese joint venture is included in the consolidated income statement on the equity accounting basis.
The holding value of the Japanese joint venture in the Group balance sheet is calculated by reference to the Group's equity in the gross assets and liabilities of the Japanese joint venture, adjusted for unrealised profit in stock.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

A business segment is defined as a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Group has determined the primary reporting segment to be geographic as the Group is engaged in providing products or services within particular geographic environments that are subject to varying risks and returns.

T Tr ra an ns sa ac ct tiio on ns s a an nd d b ba alla an nc ce es s Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
G Gr ro ou up p c co om mp pa an niie es s The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: b Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates and, c All resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.

In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.

The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.

The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.

The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
C Ca as sh h a an nd d c ca as sh h e eq qu uiiv va alle en nt ts s Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

IIn nc co om me e t ta ax x Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and, differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

R Re ev five en nu ue e r re ec co og gn niit tiio on n Revenue comprises the amounts receivable for the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from contractual payments is recognised by reference to completion of a specific milestone in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
Royalty income is recognised when the amount payable is known.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods.

D fide ef fiin ne ed d b be en ne ef fiit t p pe en ns siio on n p plla an ns s The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 - Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of recognised income and expense as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are being immediately recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.

The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the parent's share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or Total Shareholder Return, would not result in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
P Pr ro ov viis siio on ns s A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and it has been reliably estimated.

The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group hedges, using forward exchange contracts, a proportion of sales denominated in a foreign currency.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
The majority of schemes outside the UK are defined contribution.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which certain employees of subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees have been invited to join the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.

The awards normally become exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the grant date subject to the Group's performance over the three year period commencing at the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
The extent to which the award may become exercisable is dependent on two performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Company's Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Group's earnings per share EPS : The Company's TSR element of an award will vest in full if the Company's TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 12.5% on a pro-rata basis for the median performance.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no shares will vest under this performance condition unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group over the relevant performance period: The Group's EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 10% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.
