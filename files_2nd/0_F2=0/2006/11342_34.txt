EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes for its employees, the Northgate Information Solutions Pension Scheme the Northgate Scheme and the Rebus Group Pension Scheme the Rebus Scheme.
Benefits are related to salary close to retirement or leaving service if earlier and also to years of pensionable service.
Assets are held in separate, trustee administered funds.
Employer contributions to the schemes are determined on the basis of regular valuations undertaken by independent, qualified actuaries.
The schemes are closed to new employees, who are instead eligible to join the defined contribution section of the Northgate Scheme.
The accounting numbers are based on updated funding valuations carried out as at 31 March 2005 for the Northgate Scheme and 1 April 2005 for the Rebus Scheme.
The Group has adopted the revisions to IAS 19 which were published in December 2004.
As permitted by the revised standard, actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the period in which they occur outside income and expense through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Liability for defined benefit obligations The principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date were: Northgate Rebus Northgate Rebus Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme 2006 2006 2005 2005 %% %% Discount rate at 30 April 5.2 5.2 5.4 5.4 Expected return on plan assets at 30 April 6.4 6.0 6.5 6.1 Future salary increases 2.9 2.9 2.9 2.7 Retail price inflation 2.9 2.9 2.7 2.7 Future pension increases 2.5% LPI 2.2 2.2 N A N A Future pension increases 5% LPI 2.9 2.9 2.5 2.5 The post-retirement mortality assumptions based on PA92 tables allow for future improvements in mortality.
The assumed life expectancy for a male active member reaching age 65 at the accounting date is 19.6 years 2005: 19.4 years in the Northgate Scheme, 19.0 years in the Rebus Scheme.
Allowance has been made for further improvements to mortality, whereby the assumed life expectancy of a male member on reaching age 65 in 20 years time is 20.9 years 2005: 19.4 years in the Northgate Scheme, 19.0 years in the Rebus Scheme.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued Liability for defined benefit obligations continued The expected rate of return on the pension plan assets is determined as the Groups best estimate of the long term return of the major asset classes equities, bonds, gilts and cash weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return is calculated using geometric averaging.
The value of assets to be transferred has been estimated as at 30 April 2006, based on the agreed assumptions and details of the transferring members.
Over the next year, the Group will pay estimated contributions of 9.6m to the UK defined benefit schemes 6.5m to the Northgate Scheme and 3.1m to the Rebus Scheme.
This includes additional contributions aimed at removing the deficit of the Schemes.
This has increased from 2.1m to 6.5m per annum with effect from April 2006 and has no impact on reported profits with the liability being recognised in full.
