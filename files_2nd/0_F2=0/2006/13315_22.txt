On 30 November 2006, the group announced its intention to commence a strategic review of its Electronic Security division.
This strategic review remained ongoing at 31 December 2006.
The Electronic Security division represents a separate major line of business for the group in accordance with IAS 14.
The business has been classified within continuing operations in the income statement and the assets have not been classified as held for sale as a disposal was not highly probable at 31 December 2006.
An impairment review of the carrying values of the Electronic Security businesses was performed at 31 December 2006 and no impairment recorded as the estimated recoverable amount of the business was higher than the carrying values of the total net assets of the business.
Since the year end date the group has announced its intention to dispose of the Electronic Security division and has initiated discussions with prospective purchasers.
Initial bids were received in February 2007 and a second round of bids is expected in March 2007.
The group considers that it is highly probable that the businesses will be disposed of during 2007 and in accordance with IFRS 5 the division will be treated as discontinued operations in the groups financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2007.

Using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 0% and 3% and pre-tax discount rates of between 9% and 13%.
No reasonably possible change in these key assumptions would give rise to an impairment.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.

Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments together with other outgoings, after taking into account existing sub-tenant arrangements and assumptions relating to later periods of vacancy.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
Self insurance The group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks in order to limit the maximum potential loss that could be suffered in any one year.
Individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions.
The annual review of these provisions by external actuaries resulted in a decrease in the reserves and in the insurance charge to the income statement in the year of 2.8m 2005: 0.3m.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses together with amounts set aside to cover certain legal and regulatory claims.
During 2006, Initial BTB SA, a group subsidiary operating in France, received a Statement of Objections from the French Competition Council Conseil fide la Concurrence alleging that certain of the companys activities in a period between 1997 and 2002 have infringed French competition laws.
After taking appropriate legal advice, the group has recorded a provision in respect of the possible regulatory fine to be imposed by the French authorities.
At 31 December 2006, this provision represents the groups best estimate of the total liability that may arise.
It is possible that the ultimate liability may be different from the amount of the provision currently recorded.
The total amount of the provision is not disclosed as this may prejudice the groups position in this matter.

The effective interest rate on the ?500m note is 5.9%.
The effective interest rates on the 250m and 300m notes are 6.20% and 5.82% respectively.
For all other bonds the effective interest rate approximates to the coupon.
The floating rate bonds that are not designated as hedges in accordance with IAS 39 are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost and retranslated at the period end rate.
The related swap a derivative is marked-to-market at the period end date.
The exchange effect on the bond and the movement on the swap revaluation are both reported within finance costs and act as a natural hedge.
96 Rentokil Initial plc [Notes to the Accounts] Floating rate loans bear interest at rates, based on the relevant national borrowing rate benchmark equivalents e. g. LIBOR, which are fixed in advance usually for periods of between one and twelve months.
The group has no significant fixed rate debt except for the fixed rate bonds disclosed above.
These bonds are designated in fair value hedges which convert them to floating interest rates.
The groups floating rate exposure is managed using forward rate agreements which all mature within one year, except for contracts with a nominal value of 225m and 220m which mature within 13 months.
Other borrowings represent bank loans and overdrafts and are held at amortised cost.
Fair value hedge accounting has been applied to all the notes and related derivatives marked as FV fair value hedge in accordance with IAS 39.
The related derivative and the hedged note are both marked-to-market and the ineffective portion of the hedge is taken directly to finance costs.
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, all the notes and related derivatives have been marked as NH non-hedge and any changes are taken to finance costs.
Net investment hedging The group has designated the ?500m note as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the eurozone.
The fair value of the euro note at 31 December 2006 was 349.8m 2005: 364.7m.
In the prior year, the Japanese Yen bank borrowings with a fair value of 6.4m were designated as a hedge of the net investment in the groups subsidiaries in Japan.
In the current year, this relationship was replaced by cross-currency swaps referred to below.
The group has entered into cross-currency swaps to convert GBP debt into synthetic Yen, USD and AUD debt.
The notional amounts of cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the net investment in subsidiaries at 31 December 2006 were 5.5m 2005: nil, 22.0m 2005: nil and 12.2m 2005: nil respectively.
The foreign exchange gain of 8.8m 2005: 0.2m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.
Where net investment hedging has been applied to the medium term notes, the related note has been marked with a NIH.

Similarly, the groups businesses do not undertake significant cross border trade and therefore are not subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk.

Central treasury companies invest all significant cash surpluses in major currencies, US$ and euro at money market rates.
Short-term deposits are placed with banks usually for maturities of up to six months and earn interest at market rates related to the currency and the sums invested.
Investments Fixed rate cash deposits include 6.4m 2005: 6.6m invested in UK and US Government bonds which are held by the groups insurance operations in accordance with local insurance regulations and are used to meet insurance liabilities as they fall due.
The weighted average effective interest rate earned is 6.4% 2005: 4.2% and the weighted average rate is fixed for 1.4 years 2005: 2.3 years.

Capital losses carried forward amount to 84.4m 2005: 88.6m.
Other deferred tax assets amounting to 17.9m 2005: 17.9m have not been recognised due to the uncertainty regarding their utilisation.
100 Rentokil Initial plc [Notes to the Accounts] Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised in respect of withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries as such amounts are permanently reinvested.
If these earnings were remitted, tax of 26.4m 2005: 19.7m would be payable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the United Kingdom, which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants other than the Initial No2 Section, accounting for 0.5% of the total schemes liabilities, which remains open.
On 19 December 2005, a detailed consultation began between the company and the active members of the RIPS on the freezing of the future accrual of benefits for active members.
Following this consultation, future accrual ceased as from 31 August 2006 and defined benefit members moved into new defined contribution arrangements, resulting in a curtailment credit of 14.0m.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent full valuation was at 31 March 2005 with an interim valuation performed at 31 August 2006 which was used as the basis for the IAS 19 valuation in these financial statements.
These defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The principal assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2006 2005 Weighted average % Discount rate 5.1% 4.7% Expected return on plan assets 5.5% 6.3% Future salary increases 3.8% 3.6% Future pension increases 3.1% 2.8% Mortality assumptions For current pensioners, standard tables PMA92 and PFA92 projected to 2016 using the medium cohort projection and for future pensioners, standard table PMA92 and PFA92 projected to 2026 using the medium cohort projections have been assumed for 2006 and 2005.
The mortality rates are increased by 25% for non-executive members.
This equates to a man retiring at age 65 living a further 20.7 years if he is a staff member, or 22.3 years if he is an executive member.
The corresponding figures for women are 23.4 and 25.1 years respectively.

The Scheme became effective on 21 June 2005 and New Rentokil Initial changed its name to Rentokil Initial plc and Old Rentokil Initial changed its name to Rentokil Initial 1927 plc at that time.
Under the terms of the Scheme, holders of Old Rentokil Initial shares received one New Rentokil Initial share for each Old Rentokil Initial share.
On 22 June 2005, the Court approved the reduction of capital of Rentokil Initial plc, whereby the nominal value of each ordinary share was reduced from 100p to 1p.
The reduction of capital became effective on 23 June 2005.
As shown above, the effect of the scheme of arrangement and the subsequent reduction in capital has increased distributable reserves by 1,792.3m.
The capital reorganisation transaction has been treated as a reverse acquisition in the consolidated financial accounts.
Share-based payments The company has share option schemes for approximately 500 senior executives worldwide.
The exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
Share options are equity settled.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary Schemes the Discretionary Schemes are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the company.
There are three levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes.
Level 1 applies to all senior executives including executive directors, Level 2 and deferred share schemes apply to executive directors and sector managing directors.
They are summarised as follows: Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in a group of support services companies.
Deferred share schemes: shares have been offered to executive directors and divisional managing directors to compensate for loss of bonuses or share options in their previous employment on joining the group during 2005.
Deferred shares are awarded to members based upon being in continued employment at the time of meeting the various grant dates in the future.
As at 31 December 2006, 4.5m shares have been granted in respect of the deferred share scheme and 1,138,619 shares have been issued to members during the financial year then ended.
Refer to the remuneration report on pages 46 to 53 for details of the chief executives and chief financial officers share awards.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows: Weighted average Number exercise of share price options p per share 000 Outstanding at 1 January 2005 212.172 45,472 Granted 160.500 6,115 Exercised 153.349 3,740 Expired 227.147 9,003 Outstanding at 31 December 2005 206.230 38,844 Granted Exercised 156.493 593 Expired 215.406 6,336 Outstanding at 31 December 2006 205.333 31,915 Out of the 31.9m outstanding options, 15,277,767 options were exercisable.
Options exercised during the period resulted in 593,268 shares being issued at 1p each.
The related weighted average price at the time of exercise was 156.493p per share.
Number Number Year of Grant Exercise period 31 December 2005 Granted Lapsed 31 December 2006 2006 2009 - 2016 9,521,516 6,910 9,514,606 The performance conditions for these awards are earnings per share EPS growth for 50% of an award and total shareholder return TSR for the remaining 50% of an award.
For 75% of the TSR portion of an award, performance is measured by comparing the companys relative TSR performance to that of constituents of the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies.
For the remaining 25% of the TSR portion of an award, the companys TSR performance is measured against the constituents of an international group of support services companies.
Participants are entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The fair value of the above awards is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived using an option pricing tool which is a closed-form solution operating on similar principles to a Monte Carlo simulation.
The significant inputs into the model were a share price of 145p at the date of grant, an expected share price volatility of 22%, an expected life of 3 years i. e. commensurate with the vesting period and an expected correlation of 18% and 19% for the respective comparator groups.
The share price volatility and the correlation assumptions are based on statistical analysis of historical daily share prices.
As participants are entitled to dividend equivalents during the vesting period, the expected dividend yield and the assumed risk-free rate of return have no impact on the fair value of the awards.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity settled share-based payment plans was nil 2005: 3.2m.
The nil charge in the year represents 1.0m for the performance share plan, 1.6m in respect of deferred share awards and a credit of 2.6m representing the reversal of prior years charges for level 1 share options now not expected to vest.

In addition to the synergies above, the goodwill which arose from the premium paid for the acquisition of Target Express represents further cost savings expected to be obtained from the integration of Targets branch network and hubs with the network of the groups existing parcel delivery business, City Link.
A portion of the goodwill arising on acquisition of JC Ehrlich represents a premium paid by the group to gain a substantial presence in the US pest control market and to allow the group to benefit from further potential synergies available through further acquisition and integration of smaller pest control businesses in the USA.
Further goodwill is attributable to the workforce in all of the acquired businesses.

Contingent liabilities The group has contingent liabilities of 0.9m 2005: 2.0m relating to guarantees in respect of third parties.
In addition there are contingent liabilities in respect of environmental issues, tax and litigation, none of which are expected to give rise to any significant loss.
Litigation proceedings have been initiated against our former Manned Guarding business in the USA by former employees in respect of certain employment practices of that business.
The group has indemnified the acquirers of that business against any potential settlement arising from these proceedings.
The group has taken legal advice and does not believe that the action will succeed.
