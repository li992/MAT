The British Land Company PLC 105 26 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS IFRS transitional arrangements When preparing the Groups IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004, the date of transition, the following material optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies have been adopted: i Business combinations the provisions of IFRS 3 Business combinations have been applied prospectively from 1 April 2004.
The Group has chosen to not restate business combinations that took place before the date of transition: and ii Employee benefits the accumulated actuarial gains and losses in respect of employee defined benefit plans have been recognised in full through reserves.
Financial Instruments the Group has applied IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for all periods presented and has therefore not taken advantage of the option that would enable the Group to only apply these standards from 1 April 2005.
Reconciliations and explanatory notes on how the transition to IFRS has affected profit and net assets previously reported under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are given below.

This deferred tax provision is reversed for the industry proposed performance measures of Adjusted Net Asset Value and underlying earnings per share.
The basis of calculating this provision varies depending on whether value is expected to be achieved through sales or retention in the business.
As British Land has a proven record of portfolio recycling through sales and a committed strategy to recycle its capital the deferred tax provision is calculated on the basis that assets will be sold and takes account of available loss relief including indexation, but does not assume any mitigation that could be achieved through tax structuring.
Business combinations IFRS 3 Under IFRS corporate acquisitions are treated as either business combinations or asset acquisitions.
Under business combinations the purchase consideration is compared to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the company acquired and any excess is recognised as goodwill.
In property acquisitions it is from time to time common for less than a full deduction to be made in the purchase price for contingent CGT, in recognition that contingent CGT may not be crystallised for some time, if at all.
IFRS prohibits any revision of the deferred tax to its fair value and therefore goodwill may arise on acquisition accounting, equal to the amount of deferred tax provided and not discounted in the purchase price.
Asset acquisitions arise when an asset, or a group of assets, that does not constitute a business is acquired.
Under the asset acquisition method the assets and liabilities are treated as though acquired individually even if acquired in a corporate entity.
There is no deferred tax relating to revaluations as the assets are treated as acquired at cost.
Under this method there is no goodwill.
All corporate acquisitions in prior years and in the year to 31 March 2005 have been treated as business combinations.
Properties and leases IAS 16, IAS 40 and IAS 17 Under IFRS, we are required to distinguish between properties let under operating leases and those let under finance leases.
This distinction is made at the inception of the lease and is not reassessed over the life of the lease unless the lease terms are varied significantly.
Operating leases continue to be shown as a property interest in the balance sheet, but where a finance lease has been identified, IFRS requires the value of the cash flows related to the buildings to be shown as a debtor and the land as a property interest.
Income is shown on the building element on a financial rather than a rental basis.
British Land has worked closely with the British Property Federation BPF on guidance notes for the application of IFRS in a UK context see www.
A comprehensive review of the terms of each of our leases has been undertaken using the approach recommeded by the BPF, this review has identified only one material finance lease within one joint venture.
Financial instruments IAS 32 and IAS 39 British Land uses derivatives to manage its interest rate risk.
Under IFRS all derivatives, including hedges, are held on the balance sheet at fair value.
The default treatment under this standard is for movements in the fair value to be recognised in the income statement, where they will impact reported profits.
However, if an entity can demonstrate that its derivatives are effective hedges of specific risks it can choose to adopt hedge accounting.
The Group has chosen to adopt hedge accounting.
Under the transitional rules for IFRS, companies may elect to commence application of IAS 39 with effect from 1 April 2005.
British Land has chosen to apply IAS 39 in full retrospectively and not use this election.
Derivatives which hedge the Group's floating rate bank debt are classified as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value are recognised in the hedging reserve, which is part of equity reserves.
The mark-to-market adjustment on financial instruments and related taxation effects are reversed in calculating Adjusted Net Asset Value.
Cash flow The only changes to the cash flow statement are presentational.
The UK GAAP decrease in cash of 38m for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been restated as a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 19m following the reclassification of term deposits as cash and cash equivalents which increased by 19m in the year ended 31 March 2005.
