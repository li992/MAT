Impairment Testingof Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is not amortised but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit that is expected to benefit from the acquisition.
If the total recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred.
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are .
Management determined that there was noimpairment.
Goodwill arising on the formation of the joint venture was capable of separate measurement since the joint venture operated independently of the Group.
In 2005 BSN Medicals impairment test was based on fair value less costs to sell which was determined based on the expected proceeds from the sale of the Groups interest inthe joint venture.
Recoverable amounts for the other business segments are based on value in use which is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
The five-year period is in line with the Groups strategic planning process.
A discount rate of 10% 2005 13% was applied to cash flow projections.
A growth rate of 4% 2005 5% into perpetuity was used after five years to calculate a terminal value for the Groups business segments.
Management consider these to be appropriate estimates based on the growth rates of the markets inwhichthe Group operates.
The key assumptions used in preparing cash flow projections are annual sales growth, trading margins and capital utilisation.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored intothe assumptions used inthe currentyear.
