Notes to the Company Financial Statements 29 Accounting policies The following paragraphs summarise the main accounting policies of the Company, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys Financial Statements.
The corresponding amounts in these Company Financial Statements are restated in accordance with the new policies.
a Basis of preparation The Company Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
There is no material difference between historical cost profits and those reported in the profit and loss account.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under FRS 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the consolidated cash flows for all Group companies are included within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
As these Parent Company Financial Statements are presented together with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Marshalls plc within which this Company is included are set out on pages 52 to 87. b Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment where appropriate.
The Directors consider annually whether a provision against the value of investments on an individual basis is required.
Such provisions are charged in the profit and loss account in the year.
Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 89 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:54 Page 90 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued c Pension costs Defined benefit scheme The Company participated in a group pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 - Retirement benefits, accounts for the Scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the Scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Defined contribution scheme Contributions to the Groups defined contribution Pension Scheme are determined as a percentage of employees earnings and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
d Share-based payment transactions The Company enters into equity-settled share-based payment transactions with its employees.
In particular, annual awards are made to Directors under a long term incentive plan.
The long term incentive plan allows Company employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company.
These awards are granted by the ultimate parent.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
Shares granted to subsidiary company employees for their services to that subsidiary are recognised as an increase in the investment with a corresponding entry in equity.
e Own shares held by employee benefit trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored employee benefit trust are included in the Group Financial Statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
f Cash and liquid resources Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash, at or close to their carrying values, or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.
g Leased assets Elements of plant and machinery are subject to finance leases giving rights approximating to ownership.
Such assets are treated as though they had been purchased outright and are included in tangible fixed assets at a value equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made during the term of the lease.
The total amount of the future obligations outstanding is included in creditors.
The amount included in tangible fixed assets is written off over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease.
The rental cost of all operating leases is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lives of the leases.
h Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
90 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:54 Page 91 29 Accounting policies continued i Deferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation resulting from timing differences, other than those specifically excluded by FRS19 - Deferred Taxation, between profits computed for taxation purposes and profits stated in the Financial Statements to the extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of those timing differences.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
j Financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
30 Operating costs The audit fee for the Company was 20,000 2005: 20,000.
This is in respect of the audit of the Financial Statements.
31 Employees The Directors are employed by the Company.
Details of Directors remuneration, share options, long term incentive plans and Directors pension entitlements are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 40 to 49.
The increase in the year of 48,000 represents the fair value of LTIP awards granted to employees of Marshalls Group plc.

The Company is unable to identify its share of the Scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
