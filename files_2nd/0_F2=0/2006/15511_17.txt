42 telent Annual Report 2006 Notes to the accounts continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time the products are sold.
These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and take into consideration: the history of warranty cost associated with the product or similar products: the length of the warranty obligation: the development cycle of the product: and the estimated cost of one-off failures that require correction.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Contingent liabilities Through the course of normal business, the Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Group.
A determination of the amount of provision, if any, required for these contingencies is based on careful analysis of each issue with the assistance of external legal counsel.
A provision is generally made where an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs can be estimated reliably.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must also be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
