In addition, the directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2006 of 2.51p per ordinary share which will absorb an estimated 4.1m of shareholders funds.
If approved by the shareholders at the AGM, it will be paid on 4 August 2006 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 7 July 2006.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust ESOT.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees and those issuable to convertible bond holders.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Earnings used for calculation of earnings per share Earnings Earnings Profit Profit per share per share 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m pence pence Earnings used for basic earnings per share 106.6 58.5 65.1 36.1 Interest saving net of taxation on 11% Convertible Loan Stock dilution 0.2 0.2 1.5 1.0 Share option scheme dilution 0.9 0.3 Total diluted earnings 106.8 58.7 62.7 34.8 Less non trading items 94.9 48.3 55.7 28.6 Trading diluted earnings 11.9 10.4 7.0 6.2 Weighted average number of shares used for calculating earnings per share 2006 2005 Number Number Weighted average number of shares excluding shares held in the ESOT 163,629,157 161,931,920 Dilution due to Share Option Schemes 2,538,531 1,682,780 Dilution due to Convertible Loan Stock 4,400,000 5,000,000 Used for calculating diluted earnings per share 170,567,688 168,614,700 Section 4 Financial Annual Report 42 Workspace Group PLC statements and Accounts 2006 9.

The total fair value adjustment equates to 0.8p per share 31 March 2005: 1.2p.

Of the total undrawn facilities 0.2m 2005: 1.7m had a maturity of less than 12 months with the remainder having a maturity of in excess of two years.
g Financial instrument risk management objectives and policy Interest risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate collars to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
The Groups policy is to fix or cap interest rates on at least 50% of its borrowings.
Credit risk The credit risk in liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with investment grade credit ratings.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk from its customers as exposure is spread over a large number of entities.
Liquidity risk The Group minimises liquidity risk by continually refreshing the maturity profile of its debt.

The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The expected dividend is based on the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.

The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts, with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise, for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.
