Under this the Group conducts a formal annual review to determine whether the carrying value of the goodwill on the balance sheet can be justified.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill with its recoverable amount the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The Group has calculated both fair value less costs to sell and value in use for each cash-generating unit CGU within broadcast brands.
Substantially all of the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to sell.
For multiplexes, value in use only has been used.
The assumptions used to calculate the values are consistent across all CGUs.
Fair value less costs to sell has been determined by reference to the revenue multiples of appropriate transactions in the industry in recent years applied to the businesss own internal estimates.
The value in use calculations are based on cashflow projections over the remaining useful life of the CGUs discounted at a post-tax discount rate excluding inflation of 7.75%.
A post-tax discount rate is used because this is readily available in the financial markets.
Calculating the recoverable amount on a post-tax basis using a post-tax discount rate would lead to substantially the same results as pre-tax calculations.
The cashflows utilise the businesss internal estimates for the next three years with revenue and direct cost growth in subsequent years the most sensitive assumption based on HM Treasurys neutral growth estimate for the UK of 2.5%.
The key assumptions in determining the value in use calculations are: Assumptions How determined Advertising revenue Macro-economic outlook, industry forecasts and internal estimates Audience performance Long-term trends and internal estimates The results of the review undertaken at 31 March 2006 indicated that an impairment charge of 12.8 million was necessary in respect of goodwill held in relation to broadcast brands see note 4.
This charge is included within the amortisation and impairment caption in the income statement and has been classified as part of separately disclosed items.
