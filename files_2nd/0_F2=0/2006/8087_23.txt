Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 1 General Information Informa plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 44.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 7 and in the Corporate and Risk Information section of the Directors Report on page 44.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 3.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but have not yet come into effect: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 - Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The additional disclosures under IFRS 7 include stating the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities under each of the classifications in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: an analysis of the age for financial assets that are either past due or impaired: a reconciliation of changes in carrying amounts during a period where impairment is recorded through an allowance account as opposed to a direct reduction to the carrying amount of the financial asset: and additional requirements on providing sensitivity analysis on market risks and how changes in these risks would have impacted profit or loss and equity in the period.
2 Basis of Preparation On 1 January 2005, Informa plc adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
IAS 19 Employee benefits, issued in December 2004, was adopted by Informa plc on 1 January 2005, in advance of the effective date of 1 January 2006.
Therefore actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit pension schemes are presented without restatement in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense for 2005 and 2006.
Management believe that adjusted operating profit Note 9 and adjusted earnings per share Note 17 provide additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The term adjusted is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit.
The principal adjustments made are in respect of: Restructuring costs the costs incurred by the Group in reorganising and integrating businesses, in relation to acquisitions and closures, are classified as restructuring: Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets the Group continues to amortise these intangible fixed assets and test for impairment of those assets but does not see these charges as integral to underlying trading: Finance income and costs gains losses made on exchange contracts for hedging capital transactions which do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Bank facility fees written off capitalised facility fees are amortised over the loan periods but where syndicated loan facilities have been terminated early and new facilities undertaken on funding major acquisitions, the unamortised fees are immediately expensed.
This accelerated expense is not viewed as being part of operating activities and is thus excluded from the adjusted results: and Discontinuing activities where the Group is in the process of exiting a major geographical location or line of business, having announced the decision but still being in the process of winding down trade.
The Groups operations are split into three broad market sectors of Academic & Scientific, Professional and Commercial.
These divisions are further analysed into more specific segments which bring together products in comparable market areas under common business heads.
This is how the Groups operational management is structured and its results are reviewed and thus form the primary reporting segments Note 7.
66 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 3 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain assets and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity and consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, which is when the strategic and operating policy decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The arrangements the Group has entered into involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest.
The Group reports its interests using proportionate consolidation and combines its share of the assets, liabilities, income and expense with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line by line basis.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, and provisions for returns and cancellations.
Subscription income is deferred and recognised over the term of the subscription.
Conference income is deferred and recognised when the conference is held.
Income from managed events represents fees earned and is recognised when the event is held.
Consulting and training revenues are recognised as services are delivered.
Where consultancy services are provided over a period of time, revenue is recognised using the stage of completion method when the outcome of the contract can be measured reliably.
The stage to completion is determined with regard to key milestones in the contract being attained and the percentage of services performed under the contract as a percentage of the total services to be performed.
Royalty revenue is recognised as the franchisee recognises their revenue.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
67 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 3 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
It is recognised as an asset at cost, assessed for impairment at least annually and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units, as defined by the Board for internal management purposes, expected to benefit from the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Where an impairment test is performed a discounted cash flow analysis is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash generating unit compared with the carrying value of that goodwill.
Management estimate the discount rates as the risk affected cost of capital for the particular cash generating units.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Upon disposal the attributable carrying value of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
For business combinations, cost is calculated based on the Groups valuation methodologies Note 5.
These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, which are as follows: Book lists 20 years Journal titles 20-40 years Database content and intellectual property 4-10 years Large scale events and exhibitions 8-10 years Software, which is not integral to a related item of hardware, is included in intangible assets.
Capitalised internal-use software costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote substantial time to, the project.
Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its internal purpose.
These costs are amortised over their expected useful lives which are deemed to be 3-5 years.
The expected useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually.
Property and equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Over life of the lease Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3-15 years Freehold land is not depreciated The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each Balance Sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
68 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 3 Accounting policies continued Available for sale investments Available for sale investments are held at fair value where movements are taken through equity.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and expenses incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less marketing and distribution costs expected to be incurred.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are disclosed in the Income Statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and cross currency swaps see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at the closing rates of exchange.
The results are translated at an average rate, recalculated for each month between that months closing rate and the equivalent for the preceding month.
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the closing rate are taken directly to the hedging and translation reserve.
In addition, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries results from average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to the Groups hedging and translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised in the Income Statement in the financial year in which the operations are disposed of.
The translation movement on matched long-term foreign currency borrowings, qualifying as hedging instruments under IAS 39, are also taken directly to the hedging and translation reserve.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the Income Statement.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Rental income from sub leasing property space is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease and is matched with the corresponding payments made under the head lease.
69 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 3 Accounting policies continued Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations in respect of intangible assets and properties.
A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, including interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pension costs Certain Group companies operate defined contribution pension schemes for employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the individual companies.
The pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions payable and is charged as an expense when they fall due.
The Group also operates funded defined benefit schemes for employees.
The cost of providing these benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each Balance Sheet date.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The current service cost and the recognised element of any past service cost are presented within Operating Profit.
The interest cost arising on the pension liability less the interest return on the scheme assets is presented within Finance Costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Income Statement and in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The expected return on scheme assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension scheme.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and the fair value of any relevant scheme assets.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The fair value of the Share Options and Long Term Incentive Plan is measured using the Binomial or Monte Carlo model of valuation, which are considered to be the most appropriate valuation techniques.
The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
To assign a fair value to share awards granted under the Share Matching Plan where the proportion of the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder return, the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is considered the most appropriate.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will actually vest.
The estimate of vesting is reviewed annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
70 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 3 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
At subsequent reporting dates, debt securities that the Group has the expressed intention and ability to hold to maturity held to maturity debt securities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, and is measured as the difference between the investments carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods when an increase in the investments recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, subject to the restriction that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
All other investments are classified as available for sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Fair values are based on market values for listed investments and discounted future cash flows for non-listed investments.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Income Statement for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement for equity investments classified as available for sale are not subsequently reversed through the Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement for debt instruments classified as available for sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible with a maturity of three months or less to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
71 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 3 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The derivative instruments utilised by the Group to hedge these exposures are primarily interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Income Statement for the period.
Finance costs Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
ESOP trust shares Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders funds represent the cost of the Companys ordinary shares acquired by the Employee Share Option Plan ESOP trusts in connection with certain of the Groups employee share schemes.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to the affected parties.
4 IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005.
The Group was required to recognise transitional adjustments in accounting for its financial instruments in accordance with the measurement requirements of IAS 39 at 1 January 2005.
The financial impact of the adoption is detailed in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
IFRS 1 required the Group to recognise various transitional adjustments to account for those hedging relationships at 1 January 2005.
The accounting for those hedging relationships at transition depended on the nature of the hedged item and the hedged risk.
The Groups interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts and similar instruments that were fair value hedges of interest and foreign exchange risk on borrowings under UK GAAP were not previously accounted for on the Balance Sheet at their full fair value.
In these cases, the difference between the derivatives fair value and its previously reported carrying value has been recognised directly in opening equity hedging and translation reserve at 1 January 2005.
This had the effect of increasing trade and other receivables prepayments by 1,503,000 and increasing trade and other payables accruals by 2,451,000.
Since this date adjustments to hedged borrowings have been recognised in earnings on an amortised basis.
In accordance with IAS 39 the Group increased trade and other payables accruals by 5,000,000, as at 1 January 2005, to provide for sales ledger credits which are potentially repayable under local country legislation and relevant statutes.
72 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 5 Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable intangible assets In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable intangible assets on the acquisition of a business combination, management are required to make estimates when utilising the Groups valuation methodologies.
These methodologies include the use of discounted cash flows, revenue and gross profit multiples.
Asset lives are estimated based on the nature of the intangible asset acquired and range between 4 and 40 years.
Valuation of share-based payments In order to determine the value of share-based payments, management are required to make an estimation of the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price calculated over one, two and three years back from the date of grant.
The list of inputs used in the Binomial and Monte Carlo Simulation models to calculate the fair values are provided in Note 40.
Valuation of financial instruments at fair value Management have made a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value financial instruments at their fair value at year end.
Note 27 c details the methods used to value the primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups borrowing requirements and the derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate profile.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets.
Note 18 details the assumptions that have been applied.
Pension assumptions There are a number of assumptions management have considered on the advice of actuaries which have an impact on the results of the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities at year end.
The most significant assumptions are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
Note 39 details the assumptions which have been adopted.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been included based on management estimates of the most likely outcome Note 31.

These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The principal activities are as follows: Academic & Scientific provides a portfolio of publications, events and data services for academic and commercial users in the Scientific, Technical & Medical areas and Humanities & Social Sciences areas.
Professional this division comprises Financial Data Analysis, which focuses on the electronic delivery of news, data and information solutions to the global financial services industry: Performance Improvement, which provides performance analysis, diagnostics and customised training for corporate and government organisations: and Finance, Insurance, Law & Tax based in the UK and Holland, which contains the finance, legal, media, insurance and banking publications and their related conference and course activity.
Commercial This division consists of two market-facing units, which provide print, electronic, and consultancy services and events to the Telecoms & Media markets and the Maritime & Commodities industries.
The division also contains the Group's regional events businesses those outside the UK and US.
The discontinued operations Note 14 relate to Euroforum France E. U. R. L. and have been excluded from the segmental analysis for 2005.
Euroforum France E. U. R. L. previously formed part of the Regional Events segment and in 2005 had revenues of 1,554,000, a net loss of 1,885,000 and an adjusted operating loss of 500,000.

80 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 17 Earnings per Share Basic The basic earnings per share calculation is based on a profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent of 67,368,000 2005 profit: 8,825,000.
This profit on ordinary activities after taxation is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue less those non-vested shares held by employee share ownership trusts which is 421,619,174 2005: 388,230,732.
Diluted The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the basic earnings per share calculation above except that the weighted average number of shares includes all potentially dilutive options granted by the Balance Sheet date as if those options had been exercised on the first day of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted average of 423,346,817 2005: 390,003,685.
The table below sets out the adjustment in respect of diluted potential ordinary shares: 2006 2005 Weighted average number of shares used in basic earnings per share calculation 421,619,174 388,230,732 Effect of dilutive share options 1,727,643 1,772,953 Weighted average number of shares used in diluted earnings per share calculation 423,346,817 390,003,685 Adjusted earnings per share The basic and diluted adjusted earnings per share calculations have been made to allow shareholders to gain a further understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
It is based on the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations above except that profits are based on continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders and are adjusted for items that are not perceived by management to be part of the underlying trends in the business and the tax effect of those adjusting items as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Profit for the financial year from continuing operations 67,847 10,767 Minority interests 479 57 Adjusting items net of attributable taxation Note 9 64,306 75,734 Adjusted profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders 131,674 86,444 Earnings per share: From continuing operations - Adjusted basic p 31.23 22.27 - Adjusted diluted p 31.10 22.16 81 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 18 Goodwill 000 Cost At 1 January 2005 618,023 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 501,801 Additional goodwill recognised during the year relating to prior year acquisitions 4,641 Exchange differences 13,953 At 1 January 2006 1,138,418 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries Note 35 59,254 Additional goodwill recognised during the year relating to prior year acquisitions 636 Reclassification 1,698 Exchange differences 60,148 At 31 December 2006 1,139,858 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 January 2005 15,000 Impairment losses for the year - At 1 January 2006 15,000 1 Impairment losses for the year 515 Exchange differences 186 At 31 December 2006 15,329 Carrying amount At 31 December 2006 1,124,529 At 31 December 2005 1,123,418 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The CGUs are in line with the segments as identified in Note 7.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Academic & Scientific Division Scientific, Technical & Medical 428,769 398,571 Humanities & Social Sciences 146,076 128,581 574,845 527,152 Professional Division Performance Improvement 130,100 141,555 Financial Data Analysis 68,758 70,890 Finance, Insurance, Law & Tax 92,291 101,616 291,149 314,061 Commercial Division Regional Events 189,914 209,223 Telecoms & Media 36,049 39,116 Maritime & Commodities 32,572 33,866 258,535 282,205 Consolidated total 1,124,529 1,123,418 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following 5 years based on estimated growth rates of between 3 per cent and 6 per cent and a further 15 years based on estimated long-term growth in gross domestic product of 2.5 per cent.
The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the cash flows in both 2006 and 2005 for all CGUs are between 7 per cent and 10 per cent.
At 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were impairment tested and deemed not to be impaired, other than as noted below.
These were calculated based on future projected cash flows discounted at rates as disclosed above, which represented the Groups weighted average cost of capital plus a premium for risk.
The weighted average cost of capital for the Group at 31 December 2006 was estimated as 8.20% 2005: 7.58%.
1 The impairment loss recognised in 2006 relates to the sale on 1 February 2007 of the shares held in Falconbury Limited.
In 2005 additional software items were identified and reclassified as intangible assets to the value of 3,565,000.
Miscellaneous items with a cost of 315,000 and accumulated depreciation of 70,000 were reclassified from equipment, fixtures and fittings to leasehold land and buildings.
In 2005 an amount of 200,000 was reclassified from non-current assets held for sale to freehold land and buildings.
2 Of the 9,705,000 2005: 9,511,000 additions to property and equipment, the whole amount for both years is represented by cash paid.
Note 38 discloses the contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment the Group had entered into as at 31 December 2006.
The net book value of assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts included in property and equipment in the Group was 19,000 2005: 40,000.
The depreciation charge on these assets in the year was 7,000 2005: 24,000.

86 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 24 Trade and Other Receivables 2006 2005 000 000 Trade receivables 153,095 144,209 Other receivables 19,594 13,915 Prepayments and accrued income 9,531 15,782 Conference costs in advance 10,767 11,368 192,987 185,274 The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 32 days 2005: 30 days.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 13,194,000 2005: 13,563,000.
This allowance has been determined by references to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, which are non-interest bearing, approximates their fair value.
Credit Risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income, derivative financial instruments and investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, and prepayments and accrued income.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the Balance Sheet.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for Balance Sheet purposes: 2006 2005 000 000 Deferred tax liability 244,320 240,431 Deferred tax asset 19,900 13,106 224,420 227,325 At 31 December 2006, the Group has unused tax losses of nil 2005: 8,856,000 available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of nil, of which nil relates to current tax and nil relates to deferred tax 2005: 3,720,000, has been recognised in respect of these losses.
At the Balance Sheet date, the aggregate amount of post acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 226,500,000 2005: 161,894,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
87 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2006 26 Inventories 2006 2005 000 000 Raw materials 1,728 1,778 Work in progress 6,868 6,751 Finished goods and goods for resale 25,005 22,609 33,601 31,138 27 Financial Instruments The Groups activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to hedge these exposures as explained further below using primarily interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Treasury policy The Board sets the Groups treasury policy to ensure that it has adequate financial resources to develop the Groups businesses and to manage the currency and interest risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Group mainly uses foreign exchange forward and spot contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
All external hedging is performed by the Group Treasury function.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where a derivative in whole or in part cannot be designated in an effective hedge relationship any gain or loss arising on the undesignated portion of the derivative is immediately recognised in the Income Statement.
Those derivative financial instruments or portions thereof that are not designated in a hedge relationship are classified as held for trading.
Group Treasury acts as a service centre operating under the clearly defined regulation of the Board.
The Group monitors the distribution of its cash assets, borrowings and facilities so as to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
Funding and cash management The Group primarily borrows at short-term variable rates under its multi-currency loan facilities.
These borrowings are guaranteed by material subsidiary companies.
In connection with the acquisition of IIR, in May 2005 the Group arranged for a new five-year loan agreement, becoming effective upon the acquisition of IIR in July 2005 and comprising three facilities: A - Term loans of GBP 250m and USD 500m: B - Multi-currency revolving facilities of GBP 400m: and C - Equity bridge facility of GBP 300m.
The previously existing loan facility was cancelled at the same time.
Facility C was repaid and cancelled in July 2005 following the Rights Issue.
In 2001, the Group raised USD 50m on the US private placement market.
The 7.35% Guaranteed Senior Unsecured Notes in respect of the Private Placement are due in seven equal annual instalments from August 2005 to August 2011.
Operationally, cash pooling arrangements have been organised in primarily GBP, EUR and USD to minimise interest payable on net overdrafts and or maximise interest receivable on net surplus balances.
Cash flows Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been and is expected to continue to be in a net borrowing position.
The Groups policy is to fulfil its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates, principally GBP, USD and EUR: thereby providing a natural hedge against projected future surplus USD and EUR cash inflows as well as spreading the Groups interest rate profile across a number of currencies.
In addition, GBP denominated borrowings serve to reduce the exposure of the Groups debt to EBITDA banking covenant to movements in exchange rates in respect of currency denominated debt.
Therefore the Group seeks to maintain GBP denominated borrowings in the range of 25% - 50% of total borrowings, including where necessary, the selling of USD and EUR for GBP on a regular basis.
In addition, if a significant foreign currency denominated future transaction or cash flow is projected, then the Group may utilise forward foreign exchange contracts to help hedge the associated risk.
Foreign currency risk Allied to the Groups above policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its net investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries functional currencies, primarily EUR and USD.
This policy has the effect of protecting the Groups Consolidated Balance Sheet from movements in those currencies to the extent that the associated net assets exceed the net foreign currency borrowings.
Interest rate risk The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by using interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge up to 90% of forecast interest payments over a period of up to five years, based on forecast net debt levels by currency during that period.
This policy provides a level of certainty of future interest costs by swapping floating to fixed interest payments which in turn assists the predictability of achieving interest-based loan covenants.
