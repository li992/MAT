Explanatory notes to the notice of meeting continued Amendments The Board or the Remuneration Committee may, at any time, amend the rules of the SAYE Scheme and the Share Option Plan, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing eligibility, limits on participation, the overall limits on the issue of shares, terms of exercise other than in respect of the performance conditions as described above, the rights attaching to the shares acquired and the adjustment of awards.
The approval of HMRC will also be required for any amendment to a key feature of the SAYE Scheme and, in relation to approved options, the Share Option Plan.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to obtain or maintain HMRC approval of the SAYE Scheme or the Share Option Plan, to benefit the administration of the SAYE Scheme or the Share Option Plan, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company in the Group.
Termination The SAYE Scheme and the Share Option Plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of their adoption, or such earlier time as the Board or the Remuneration Committee may determine, after which time no further options may be granted but the rights attaching to existing awards will not be affected by such termination.
Item 12: Authority to allot shares Resolution 12 renews the authority given to your directors at the last Annual General Meeting to allot relevant securities in accordance with Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, such authority to expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution.
The directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
The authority sought is limited to an aggregate nominal amount of 14,707,421.50 being 24.39% of the Companys total ordinary share capital in issue as at 16 March 2007.
The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 16 March 2007.
The Board has no specific plans to exercise this authority other than in connection with employee share schemes, and the operation of any scrip dividend offer and any scrip dividend mandate scheme.
It wishes to obtain the necessary authority from shareholders so that allotments can be made should it be desirable and should suitable market conditions arise at short notice and without the need to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company which would be both costly and time consuming.
Item 13: Disapplication of pre-emption rights Resolution 13 seeks to renew the authority given to your directors at the last Annual General Meeting to make limited allotments of ordinary shares for cash without application of the statutory pre-emption rights which require a company to offer all allotments of ordinary shares for cash proportionately to existing shareholders first pursuant to Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985.
This power would provide the directors with the flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders when opportunities arise, so that: i the Company can follow normal practices in the event of a rights issue: and ii ordinary shares may be issued wholly for cash other than proportionately to existing ordinary shareholders up to a maximum of 3,014,628.50 which represents 5% of the Company's total ordinary share capital in issue as at 16 March 2007.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Pre-Emption Group, the directors confirm their intention that no more than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the Company will be issued for cash on a pre-emptive basis during any three year period.
There are presently no plans to allot ordinary shares wholly for cash other than in connection with employee share schemes.
Shares allotted under an employee share scheme are not subject to statutory pre-emption rights.
The authority sought by Resolution 13 will last until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution.
The directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
Item 14: Authority to purchase own shares In accordance with Article 45 the directors are seeking renewal of the authority granted at last years Annual General Meeting to enable the Company to make market purchases of up to 12,058,515 of its own shares representing approximately 10% of the Companys total ordinary share capital in issue as at 16 March 2007.
Before exercising such authority, the directors would ensure that the Company was complying with the current relevant UK Listing Authority and ABI guidelines.
No purchases would be made unless the directors believe that the effect would be to increase the earnings per share of the remaining shareholders and the directors consider the purchases to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Any shares so purchased would be cancelled.
The directors have no present intention of making such purchases but, in view of the strong balance sheet position, would like to have the flexibility to consider such purchases in the future.
Any purchase of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange.
The maximum price which may be paid for each ordinary share shall be the higher of: a an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the Company agrees to buy the ordinary shares: and b an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System SETS.
The minimum price would be 50 pence being the nominal value of each ordinary share.
The authority will only be valid until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2008.
As at 16 March 2007 there were options over 1,137,287 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which represent 0.94% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
If the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options would represent 1.05% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
