Group overview Operational review and Financial review and Financial statements CSR governance Group 107 30 Retirement bene t liabilities One of the Groups pension schemes in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Bene ts Scheme, is a fide ned bene t scheme, which is contracted out of the State Scheme and provides bene ts based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2004 by a professionally quali ed actuary.
On 5 April 2007 there will be a change to the bene ts provided under the scheme.
From that date bene ts will be based on Career Averaged Revalued Earnings CARE.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2006 2005 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.20 4.75 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.75 2.75 Discount rate 5.20 4.80 Expected return on scheme assets 7.03 7.09 The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the bene t obligation.
The mortality assumptions used by the actuary take account of standard actuarial tables compiled from UK wide statistics relating to occupational pension schemes.
These assumptions are regularly reviewed for their appropriateness.
