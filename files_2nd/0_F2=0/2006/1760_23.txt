The Group has allocated its goodwill across approximately 20 cashgenerating units.
Other than the goodwill allocated to the US operations within the Land & Armaments business group acquired as part of the acquisition of United Defense Industries, Inc. in 2005 of 1,984m, none of the cash-generating units has allocated goodwill exceeding 10% of the Groups total goodwill balance.
The Groups approach to goodwill impairment testing is set out in the accounting policies on page 76.
The key assumption underpinning the Integrated Business Plan projections for the US operations within the Land & Armaments business group is that US government defence spending will remain stable in the foreseeable future and that there will be no material reduction in the businesses share of programmes in which it currently participates.
The directors have not identified any reasonable possible changes in key assumptions for this business that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
Beyond the assumptions that US and UK government defence spending remains stable there are no individually significant assumptions made in relation to the other cash-generating units where reasonably possible changes to key assumptions would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
The result of the review of the carrying value of goodwill across the Group is an impairment charge of 32m.

The Group exercised its option to redeem the US$500m floating rate note during September 2006.
The European Investment Bank borrowing consists of three sterling denominated loans, two of which matured during 2006 whilst the third matures in 2009.
The coupon rate on the outstanding loan is fixed with an interest rate of 6.86%.
For more information on the debt instrument of the convertible preference shares refer to note 1.
The US$500m 4.75% bond, repayable 2010 was converted on issue to a floating rate bond by utilising an interest rate swap giving an effective rate during 2006 of 5.71%.
The US$1bn 6.4% bond, repayable 2011 has been partially converted to a floating rate bond by utilising a series of interest rate swaps with different tenors: US$500m has been swapped until maturity of the bond in 2011 and US$250m has been swapped until December 2007.
This has been overlayed by US$300m of floating to fixed interest rate swaps that fix the interest payments at a lower rate than the original coupon.
The effective interest rate during 2006 was 6.35% with an interest rate split on the bond at 31 December 2006 being US$550m fixed and US$450m floating.
The Class B and Class G certificates are repayable in 2011 and 2013 respectively with fixed US$ coupon rates of 7.156% and 6.664%, giving a weighted average interest rate of 6.879%.
At 31 December 2006, the gross outstanding principal due is US$1,306m.
Of this balance, US$414m has been converted to a sterling floating rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap which resulted in an effective interest rate during 2006 of 5.59% on this element.
The US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027 was converted at issue to a sterling fixed rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap and has an effective interest rate of 7.73%.

Retirement benefit obligations Pension plans BAE Systems plc operates pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal plans in the UK and US are funded defined benefit plans and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans in other countries are unfunded.
Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19 deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the deficit of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2006.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans were: UK US 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 % % % % % % Inflation rate 3.0 2.8 2.7 3.0 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 3.8 3.7 5.8 5.8 5.8 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.9-3.0 2.6-2.8 2.5-3.0 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 3.0 2.8 2.7 n a n a n a Discount rate 5.2 4.8 5.3 5.9 5.8 5.9 Long-term healthcare cost increases n a n a n a 5.7 5.7 5.7 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid value of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2006, used PA 92 medium cohort tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members.
For its US pension arrangements the mortality tables used for pensioners and non-pensioners are RP 2000 projected to 2010 2005 RP 2000 projected to 2006.
For the pension and healthcare arrangements the post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK and US plans range from 18 to 22 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 21 to 25 years for current female pensioners at age 65.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 10% in 2006 reducing to 5% by 2015 for pre-retirement and 10% in 2006 reducing to 5% for post-retirement.
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown below.
The full disclosures, as required by IAS 19, are provided in the subsequent information.

As these plans are multi-employer plans the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and to Airbus SAS based upon a reasonable and consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
Retirement benefit obligations continued When setting the overall expected rate of return on plan assets, historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and bonds are preserved.
This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Contributions The Group contributions made to the defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2006 were 1,020m 2005 260m.
Of this amount, 733m were special contributions towards funding the deficit and 287m were regular contributions.
In 2007, the Group expects to make regular contributions at a similar level to those made in 2006.
The Group also incurred a charge in respect of the cash contributions of 57m 2005 41m paid to defined contribution plans for employees.
It expects to make a contribution of 56m to these plans in 2007.
The amounts recognised in the income statement after allocation to equity accounted investments and other participating employers are as follows: 2006 2005 UK UK defined US and defined US and benefit other US benefit other US pension pension healthcare pension pension healthcare plans plans plans Total plans plans plans Total m m m m m m m m Included in operating costs: Current service cost 129 60 2 191 123 56 2 181 Past service cost 5 2 7 12 1 9 4 134 62 2 198 135 57 7 185 Included in other income: 6 Curtailments and settlements 49 61 110 Included in finance costs: Expected return on plan assets 601 132 6 739 523 104 5 632 Interest on obligations 568 118 8 694 527 98 8 633 33 14 2 45 4 6 3 1 Included in share of results of equity accounted investments: Groups share of equity accounted investments operating costs 7 7 11 11 Groups share of equity accounted investments finance costs 4 4 6 includes a curtailment gain of 11m in respect of the UK Aerostructures business disposed of in 2006 A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects: One percentage One percentage point increase point decrease m m Effect on the aggregate of service cost and interest cost 0.2 0.2 Effect on defined benefit obligations 3 2 In June 2006, the Group announced it had agreed a programme of measures to address the funding deficit in its principal UK pension plans.
The measures included one-off contributions of 679m and agreed changes to the members benefits to reduce future liabilities.
The one-off contributions of 679m included certain properties valued at 242m, the right to receive a share of the deferred consideration under the put call option arrangement arising from the Eurosystems transaction in 2005 and valued at 238m, and 199m in cash.
The properties were sold to the scheme at market value, generating a profit on disposal of 100m.
Within EBITA, this profit on disposal was offset by an operating charge of 103m relating to various funding arrangements with the Groups equity accounted investments.
In addition, there was a one-off cash contribution to US pension schemes of $100m 54m.
The curtailment gains arising in the period were a result of certain benefit changes made.
The Groups share of the 113m curtailment gains shown above is 110m after allocation to equity accounted investments and other participating employers.
Of this 110m gain, 61m related to the reduction in the net pension liability arising from the changes to the calculation of the final US pensionable salaries and 11m arose as a result of the disposal of the UK Aerostructures business in March 2006.
The remainder is partly offset by an increase in UK current service costs in the period due to the movement in discount rates.
The following analysis summarises how these items have been reflected in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated cash flow statement: Income statement items m Included within operating costs of 11,763m 103 Included within other income of 371m: Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, and investment property 100 Pension curtailment gains 99 Profit on disposal of businesses 11 Curtailment gains within share of results of equity accounted investments excluding finance costs and taxation expense 1 EBITA 108 102 BAE Systems Annual Report 2006 22.

Further information is provided in note 24.
Such costs are generally incurred within five years.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
Such costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery.
Reorganisations ongoing operations The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Such costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
Legal costs, environmental and other provisions The Group holds provisions for expected legal, environmental and other costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Included within legal costs, environmental and other is 82m 2005 80m in respect of the cash-settled elements of certain of the Groups share option schemes note 26.
The costs in respect of this liability are expected to occur over the next five years.

Contingent liabilities and commitments Aircraft financing contingent liabilities Included within the aircraft financing provision of 52m note 23 is an exposure of 27m as discussed below: 31 December 2006 31 December 2005 m m Potential future cash flow payments in respect of aircraft financing obligations 191 460 Anticipated aircraft values 159 391 Adjustments to net present values 5 4 Net exposure provided 27 65 The Group has provided residual value guarantees RVGs in respect of certain commercial aircraft sold.
At 31 December 2006 the Groups exposure to make future payments in respect of these arrangements was 191m 2005 460m.
Certain of these arrangements are covered by a Financial Risk Insurance Programme FRIP under which the Group would place reliance on insurance cover for the anticipated aircraft values if the guarantees were called.
After taking account of the FRIP and independent appraisal valuations the directors consider that the Groups net exposure to these guarantees is covered by the provisions held and the residual values of the related aircraft.
The Group is also exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing and RVGs given by Saab AB.
Provision is made against the expected net exposures on a net present value basis within the accounts of Saab.
The Groups share of such exposure is limited to its percentage shareholding in Saab.
The reduction in the net exposure reflects the settlement of the commitment in respect of 47 RVGs in the period.
Guarantees and performance bonds The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business.
Provision is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.
Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessee The Group leases various offices, factories, shipyards and aircraft under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases and associated future minimum sublease income are as follows: 2006 2005 Payments due: m m Not later than one year 121 66 Later than one year and not later than five years 393 273 Later than five years 731 552 1,245 891 Total of future minimum sublease income under non-cancellable subleases 212 118 Capital commitments Capital expenditure contracted for but not provided for in the accounts is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Property, plant and equipment 133 93 Intangible assets 5 8 138 101 Treasury contingent liabilities Treasury contingent liabilities are set out in note 32.

The Company commenced this buyback programme on 26 October 2006 and, as at 31 December 2006, 28,675,000 2.5p ordinary shares with an aggregate nominal value of 1m were held in treasury.
Special Share One Special Share of 1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry the Special Shareholder.
Certain parts of the Companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have an interest in more than 15% of the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
Preference shares The Company also has in issue 260 million 2005 266 million 7.75p net cumulative redeemable preference shares of 25p each which have been convertible into ordinary shares of 2.5p each at the option of the holder on 31 May in any of the years since issue up to 2007, on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share.
During the year 6,116,123 shares were converted for 2,929,867 ordinary shares.
2007 will be the final year in which shareholders can elect to convert their shares.
As a result of the share repurchases during 2006, the conversion rate has decreased to 0.47554 ordinary shares for every preference share at 31 December 2006.
In accordance with the Articles of Association the preference share conversion rate will be adjusted further as a result of share repurchases made after 31 December 2006.
The Company may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time after 1 July 2007 and, in any case, will redeem any remaining shares on 1 January 2010, in each case at 100p per share together with any arrears and accruals of dividend.
The maximum redemption value of the preference shares, ignoring any arrears or accruals of dividend, is therefore 260m 2005 266m.
In accordance with IAS 32 the convertible preference shares are considered to be a compound financial instrument consisting of both a debt element and an equity component which require separate accounting treatment.
Under IAS 32, the equity option component of preference shares of 76m 2005 78m is included as a separate reserve within equity note 27.
The debt element is recognised within loans and overdrafts note 20.
The preference shares carry voting rights at a general meeting of the Company only where the preferential dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where a motion is to be proposed which abrogates, varies or modifies the rights of the preference shareholders, or where a motion is to be proposed for the winding up of the Company.
On a winding up, holders of the preference shares are entitled, after repayment of the capital paid up on the Special Share and in priority to any payment to any other class of shareholder, to the return of amounts paid up or credited as paid up on the preference shares together with a premium of 75p per share, and all arrears of preferential dividends.

1 At 31 December 2004, the fair value reserve of 636m represented the unrealised gain on the Groups holdings in the shares of Vodafone Group Plc that arose on uplifting the shares from historical cost to market value at that date.
On adoption of IAS 32, and in accordance with IFRS 1, the Groups holding in these shares was designated as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.
As a result, from 1 January 2005 movements in the market value of these shares are recorded through the income statement.
Accordingly, this was reclassified into retained earnings.
2 The credit in respect of share-based payments for the year ended 31 December 2006 comprises 21m in respect of equity-settled share-based payment schemes, 21m relating to a change in the terms of certain share-based payment schemes from cash-settled to equity-settled and 4m relating to discontinued operations.
3 Under section 4 of the British Aerospace Act 1980 the statutory reserve may only be applied in paying up unissued shares of the Group to be allotted to members of the Group as fully paid bonus shares.

Financial risk management continued Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which one party would assume the rights and or duties of another party.
The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.
The following table compares the estimated fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities to their carrying values at the balance 1 sheet date.

Financial risk management continued Collateral As shown above, the Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge certain long-term foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent on the market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2006 totalled 115m 2005 80m.
Committed undrawn borrowing facilities At 31 December 2006 the Group had a revolving credit facility RCF of 1.5bn, which expires in more than two years but less than five years 2005 1.5bn which expires in more than two years but less than five years.
The RCF was originally contracted for five years until 2010.
However, it has been extended by the agreement of two one-year extensions until 2012, although the available amount for the final year has been reduced from 1.5bn to 1.3bn.
The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year.
Interest rate fluctuations The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and deposits.
This is achieved through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon by utilising derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Groups current interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 25% 2005 25% and a maximum of 75% 2005 75% of debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had 72% 2005 70% of fixed rate debt and 28% 2005 30% of floating rate debt based on a gross debt of 3.1bn 2005 4.4bn.
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2006, the Group had a total of $1.6bn 2005 $1.7bn of this type of swap outstanding with an average duration of 3.6 years 2005 4.5 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was six years 2005 six years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 5.8% on both US dollars and sterling 2005 5.3% 5% on US dollars and 6.1% on sterling : the cost of the fixed rate debt was 7.0% 2005 6.8%.
A 1% change in shortterm rates applied to the year end fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 9m 2005 13m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents The Group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial instruments.
However, the Group has policies in place to ensure credit risk is limited by placing concentration limits.
BAE Systems has a credit limit system to manage actively its exposure to treasury counterparties.
The system assigns a maximum exposure based on the counterpartys FT composite rating.
These limits are regularly monitored and updated.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid such as overnight deposits and money market funds.
The Group, therefore, believes it has negligible exposure to price risk.
Related party transactions The Group has a related party relationship with its directors and key management as disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 65 and in note 7, its equity accounted investments note 14 and the pension plans note 22.
Transactions occur with the equity accounted investments in the normal course of business and are priced on an arms-length basis and settled on normal trade terms.
