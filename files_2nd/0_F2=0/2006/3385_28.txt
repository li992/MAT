GOODWILL - continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured the weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The growth rates are based on a prudent view of industry growth forecasts adjusted for a premium associated with the high technological nature of the businesses.
A growth assumption of 2.5% 2005: 2.5% has been used.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth as described above.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses for continuing operations have been recognised in the year and no prior impairment losses reversed.
