In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Company estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The discount rate employed is the Companys estimated weighted average cost of capital before tax and reflects the relevant risks of the assets being tested for impairment.
The discount rate used for 2005 06 is 5.6%.
The resultant impairment losses in 2004 05 were 1,481,000 as shown in the table above.

The effect of this transaction is to remove any exposure to currency risk, with regard to the settlement of this financial liability in 2009.
An analysis of the interest-rate profile of the financial liabilities, after taking account of all interest-rate swaps and the cross-currency swap on US senior loan notes, is set out in the following table.
2006 2005 000 000 Floating-rate borrowings 218,717 194,518 Fixed-rate borrowings 150,000 150,000 Other financial liability 7,700 368,717 352,218 The floating-rate borrowings are interest-bearing borrowings at rates based on LIBOR, fixed for periods of up to six months.
Financial assets Financial assets at the balance sheet date comprised: 2006 2005 000 000 Cash and short-term deposits 21,092 18,073 All cash and short-term deposits are floating-rate financial assets, earning interest at commercial rates.

All UK committed loan facilities are at floating rates based on LIBOR.
The Company has entered into swap agreements which fix 150 million of these borrowings at a rate of 6.46% excluding bank margin.
At the balance sheet date, 310 million was drawn down under the revolving-loan facilities, with interest rates set for periods of between one month and six months, at which point monies are repaid and, if appropriate, redrawn.
The undrawn facility expires in more than four years.
In addition to the UK facilities, in September 1999, the Company issued US $140 million unsecured senior notes due in 2009, carrying a fixed rate of interest of 8.48%.
The Company entered into currency and swap agreements covering the duration of these notes which remove all US dollar exposure and convert the interest rate to one based on LIBOR.
In order to comply, in the comparative period, with UK GAAP for its hedging transaction and with IAS 21, the Company has grossed up its balance sheet, so that the US $140-million senior loan notes, translated at year-end rate, are presented separately from the deferred gains, in respect of the hedging instrument disclosed as other financial liabilities on the face of the balance sheet.

The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow hedges At 30 July 2006, the Company has fixed-rate swaps designated as hedges of floating-rate borrowings.
The floating rate borrowings are interest-bearing borrowings at rates based on LIBOR, fixed for periods of up to six months.
The fixed-rate borrowings comprise floating-rate borrowings hedged using fixed-rate swaps with an effective weighted average interest rate excluding bank margin of 6.46% 2005: 6.46% and which are fixed for weighted average period of 3.0 years 2005: 4.0 years.

In respect of the NDSO and 2001 scheme, options are exercisable three years after they have been granted and only if the Companys normalised earnings per share excluding exceptional items, over any three-year period, have exceeded the growth in the RPI by an average of at least 3% per annum.
As the AESOP plan and the SAYE scheme are available to all staff, there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options under them.
The options in issue shown above include those of the directors shown on page 15.
