DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives: cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: and derivative transactions undertaken by the Group to manage market risks and currency risks.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
Market Price Risk Market price risk arises from uncertainty about the future value of the Groups investments.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions as the result of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
At the same time, the risk that the value of a financial instrument might change as a result of changes in market prices is one that is fundamental to the Groups objective, which is to deliver long-term capital growth while preserving shareholders capital.
The Groups investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward in order to achieve the Groups objective.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets by taking positions in index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those particular markets or to enable increased exposure when appropriate.
Short-term exposure to movements in exchange rates, caused by the buying and selling of investments for future settlement, is mitigated through entering into forward contracts.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements as a substantial proportion of the Groups assets and liabilities is denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular foreign currencies.
These contracts are used principally for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US dollar and Euro investments is effectively hedged by way of the Companys long-term borrowings denominated in those currencies.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations and take appropriate action.
Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups investments in quoted and unquoted companies.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Credit and Investment Risk The majority of the Groups assets comprise financial assets.
Substantially all of the assets are subject to credit or investment risk.
Exposure to any one entity is monitored by the executive Directors and senior management.
The Company complies with the requirement of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
Investments in unquoted companies are by their nature subject to potential credit losses.
Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions, each of whose credit rating is assessed.
The credit risk from other instruments such as derivatives is assessed on a case by case basis.

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity Risk The Group has significant investments in unquoted companies and private equity partnerships which are inherently illiquid.
The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet its contractual commitments.
The Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out borrowings, both short and long-term.
The Company currently has a 25 million uncommitted unsecured loan facility with one of its principal banks.
Currency exposure A significant proportion of the Groups net assets is denominated in currencies other than Sterling.

The gain of 4.062 million has been deferred in equity and this gain will reverse in the income statement during the next six years being the life of the swap.

The fair value of securities sold short by the dealing subsidiary as at 31 March 2006 amounted to 9.517 million 31 March 2005: 7.893 million.
The losses which may be incurred on a short sale are theoretically unlimited, whereas losses from purchases cannot exceed the total amount invested.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and the liability simultaneously.
