The treasury department operates 77 within a framework of policies and procedures that establishes specific guidelines to manage currency risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk and the use of counter-parties and financial instruments to manage these.
The treasury department is subject to regular internal and external audit.
The Group uses various derivative instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage the risks arising from variations in currency and interest earnings that arise from movements in exchange and interest rates.
Derivative instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group's main markets.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to manage currency risk, they are designated as hedges of currency risk on specific future cash flows, which qualify as highly probable transactions for which hedge accounting has been used.
The Group anticipates that hedge accounting criteria will continue to be met on its foreign currency and interest rate hedging activities and that no material ineffectiveness will arise which will give rise to timing issues on gains or losses being recognised through the profit and loss account.
The fair value after tax of financial derivatives based upon market values as at 31st December 2006 and designated as effective cash flow hedges was 8.1m and has been deferred in equity.
Gains and Losses arising on derivative instruments outstanding as at 31st December 2006 will be released to the income statement at various dates up to twenty four months from the balance sheet date.
No material amounts were transferred to the income statement during the period in respect of the fair value of financial derivatives.
a Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts The Groups major currency transaction currency exposure arises in USD and the Group continues to adopt a prudent approach in actively managing this exposure.
As at 31st December 2006 the Group had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts, principally in USD, amounting to a principal value of 209,812,000 2005: 114,043,000. b Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements The Group uses interest rate hedges, principally interest rate swaps, to mitigate the impact upon interest earnings and expense of changes in interest rates.
The notional principal amounts of outstanding interest rate swaps and FRAs as at 31st December 2006 was USD 100,000,000 and GBP 50,000,000 2005: USD 50,000,000.
Interest rate hedges outstanding at 31st December 2005 have USD fixed interest rates, which hedge USD LIBOR at 4.6% and GBP LIBOR at 4.5% 2005: USD 2.7%.
The weighted average period to maturity is 15.7 months.
These interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
c Price Risk The Group does not have a material exposure to commodity price risk.
