The fair value of scheme assets includes no amounts relating to any of the Groups own financial instruments or any of the property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected rate of return on each applicable asset class and reflects the actual asset allocation as at the reporting date.
For bonds, the expected rate of return reflects the redemption yields available on corporate and government bonds, as applicable, as at the reporting date.
For all other asset classes, the expected rate of return reflects the rate of return expected over the long term.
The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages are as follows: South South Australia Canada US Europe Africa America Total %%%%%%% Year ended 30 June 2006 Discount rate 4.9 5.7 6.3 5.1 8.5 7.2 5.9 Future salary increases 4.1 4.2 4.5 4.5 6.8 4.5 4.7 Future pension increases 3.0 2.5 5.5 2.7 3.3 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 6.2 6.3 7.2 6.2 8.5 7.2 6.9 Year ended 30 June 2005 Discount rate 4.3 5.2 5.1 4.6 7.5 6.0 5.1 Future salary increases 4.1 3.9 4.5 3.9 5.0 4.3 4.3 Future pension increases 3.0 2.4 3.8 2.7 2.9 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 8.0 6.3 8.3 5.7 7.8 7.0 7.4 The present value of defined benefit obligations, fair value of scheme assets and associated experience adjustments are shown prospectively from the Groups IFRS transition date as follows: South South Australia Canada US Europe Africa America Total US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Year ended 30 June 2006 Present value of defined benefit obligation 441 155 509 362 213 79 1,759 Fair value of defined benefit scheme assets 414 151 396 283 250 91 1,585 Surplus deficit in the scheme 27 4 113 79 37 12 174 Experience adjustments to scheme liabilities 14 6 3 7 31 3 58 Experience adjustments to scheme assets 13 2 4 11 28 1 45 Year ended 30 June 2005 Present value of defined benefit obligation 451 130 530 351 195 89 1,746 Fair value of defined benefit scheme assets 398 135 317 235 262 89 1,436 Surplus deficit in the scheme 53 5 213 116 67 310 Experience adjustments to scheme liabilities 1 4 2 6 5 18 Experience adjustments to scheme assets 32 9 7 13 35 10 106 Under IAS 19 AASB 119, experience adjustments to scheme liabilities do not include the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.

b Non-Australian plans are not required to report under AAS 25 Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans.
Accrued liabilities and asset values for other plans have generally been taken from IAS 19 AASB 119 disclosures as at 30 June 2006 refer above.
In the most recent actuarial reviews of the BHP Billiton Superannuation Plan, the plans actuary recommended that the BHP Billiton Group make contributions to the plan.
These were determined using an assumed contribution rate of 17.7 per cent of salaries plus top up contributions as required, a projected unit credit method of funding and on the basis that the cost of benefits is expected to be that each year as accrued.
The economic assumptions used in making these contribution recommendations include expected return on assets of 7 per cent and a salary increase rate of 3.5 per cent.
