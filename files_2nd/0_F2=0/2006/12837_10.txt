The subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures principally affecting the profits, liabilities or assets of the Group are listed in note 32 of the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends The directors recommend a final dividend of 29.50p 2005: 26.60p per ordinary share to be paid on 27th September 2006 to ordinary shareholders on the register on 25th August 2006 which together with the interim dividend of 9.30p 2005: 8.65p paid on 6th April 2006, makes a total of 38.80p for the year 2005: 35.25p.
Political and charitable contributions Charitable contributions in the United Kingdom during the year amounted to 50,000 2005: 53,000.
No political contributions were made 2005: Nil.
Research and development The Group maintains in-house facilities for research and development in the United Kingdom, Poland, Indonesia, West Africa and Australia: in addition, research and development is sub-contracted to approved external organisations.
Currently all such expenditure is charged against profit in the year in which it is incurred, as it does not meet the criteria for capitalisation under IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Payment of suppliers It is the responsibility of the management of each operating unit within the Group to agree appropriate terms of business with suppliers upon entering into binding contracts, and to adhere to these payment terms provided the relevant goods or services have been supplied in accordance with the contracts.
Employment of disabled persons During the year the Group has maintained its policy of providing equal opportunities for the appropriate employment, training and development of disabled persons.
Employee information The Group recognises the benets of keeping employees informed of the progress of the business and of involving them in their companys performance.
The methods of achieving such involvement are different in each company and country and have been developed over the years by local management working with local employees in ways which suit their particular needs and environment, with the active encouragement of the parent organisation.
Auditors In the case of each of the persons who are directors of the company at the date when this report was approved: So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information as dened by the Companies Act 1985 of which the companys auditors are unaware: and Each of the directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the companys auditors are aware of that information.

| | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT 2006 27 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED Enhanced Business Review The functional performance of the Group, along with an analysis of KPIs is provided on pages 6 to 21.
The additional information required to be disclosed in the Enhanced Business Review is shown below.
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group The Groups business activities, financial condition, results of operations or the companys share price could be affected by any or all of the following risks or uncertainties: Political and economic stability The Group conducts a significant portion of its operations outside the UK in developing markets which have an increased risk of political and economical instability: however the Group has a diverse geographic portfolio in order to help mitigate the risk that could arise in any one particular territory.
Foreign currency and treasury risk The international range of the Groups activities gives rise to both transactional exchange rate risk and translation exposure when the results, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling.
The Group requires its operating units to hedge their material transaction exposures on sales and purchases conducted in currencies other than their functional currencies.
The Groups main foreign currency exposure relates to US dollar trade balances.
The Group does not actively hedge its translation exposures as these are of an accounting rather than a cash nature, however the international spread of the Groups operations itself reduces dependence on individual currencies.
The Group maintains a centralised treasury function which operates on a non-speculative basis in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the board of directors.
The aim of this function is to mitigate the effects of any adverse movements in exchange rates and interest rates on the Groups financial results.
The Group maintains a substantial net funds position as dened on page 6.
Net funds at 31st May 2006 were 51.9 million 2005: 74.0 million, an analysis of which is provided in the Financial Highlights.
These principally comprise short and medium-term deposits and borrowings.
This mix of funds allows the Group exibility in optimising its central funding position and the ability to act promptly to counteract any adverse movements in interest rates in its overseas territories.
Raw materials The Groups profitability depends on the cost of raw materials from around the world, which exposes it to price and supply uctuation.
Key items, such as oils and fats, packaging materials and energy are subject to uctuations in price and availability.
The Group does take measures to protect against the short-term impact of these uctuations and shortfalls: however, failure to recover higher costs or shortfalls in availability could have a negative impact on profits.
Change in accounting policies During the year, the company adopted International Financial Reporting Standards for the first time.
Details of the adjustments on transition can be found in note 31 of the consolidated financial statements.
