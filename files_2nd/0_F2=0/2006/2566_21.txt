CCA adjustments The Current Cost Financial Statements for the Group and therefore the Regulatory Financial Report are prepared under the Financial Capital Maintenance convention in accordance with the principles set out in the handbook Accounting for the effects of changing prices, published in 1986 by the Accounting Standards Committee.
Set out below is a summary of the treatment of the CCA adjustments: Changes in fixed asset values are referred to as holding gains or losses arising during the year and are attributed between all Markets, Technical Areas, Components and Wholesale Services on the same basis as the associated assets.
A supplementary depreciation adjustment on fixed assets arising from differences between historic cost account HCA and current cost account CCA valuations is also attributed between the various Markets, Technical Areas, Components and Wholesale Services.
Realised holding gains or losses previously recognised as unrealised arise only on disposal of fixed assets and are attributed to Wholesale residual.
Other adjustments largely reflecting costs reported within the historic cost accounts HCA which are not included in the current cost valuations e. g. non capacity spend on Duct that does not increase capacity or functionality are also attributed between all Markets, Technical Areas, Components and Wholesale Services on the same basis as the associated assets.
Adjustments arising from foreign exchange translation of overseas investments are attributed to Wholesale residual.
The inflation adjustment to ordinary shareholders funds is not relevant to the Markets, Technical Areas and Wholesale Services for which Current Cost Financial Statements are prepared.
Inter-market balances The mean capital employed statements for the Markets, Technical Areas and Wholesale Services include balances relating to the charges from the Wholesale markets to the Retail markets.
The Retail markets are deemed to settle these charges in the same 59-day period as other operators.

BT has made significant progress in rolling out the Code of Practice and associated training across the entire company.
The EAB also agreed with the inclusion of questions relating to equivalence in BTs external customer satisfaction and Executive Summary internal employee surveys.

There is limited evidence of change in these perceptions as yet, although the EAB This report fulfils a requirement in BTs Undertakings for the Equality of Access Board EAB accepts it is still early days.

It explains who sits on the EAB, what its role is and how this is being delivered with the support of the Equality of Access Office EAO.

These include the handling of complaints from CPs and the co-ordination report from  LLP PwC, including its opinion concludes the report.
BT is addressing the EABs concerns.

Work carried out by BTs Internal Audit and Regulatory Compliance department IARC and discussions with PwC regarding their assurance procedures in the context of this report have The EAB was impressed by the commitment BT has shown to the delivery of the identified some areas for improvement.
The EAB has reviewed all of the Undertakings for which the due date fell in this reporting period.
For all of the completed reviews, those Undertakings have been Future focus confirmed as delivered.
Some have been delivered ahead of their due date, such as the Code Looking to the coming year, the EAB has some concerns.

The areas of focus will include the following: demonstrate to the satisfaction of the EAB that similar performance levels are being delivered to all customers.
36 Annex 6 The Equality of Access Board Local Loop Unbundling LLU EoI Ready for Service RFS 30 June 2006 This Undertaking requires significant systems and process work.
It is of key importance to industry and also has implications for other Undertakings such as other EoI products, which rely on LLU as input.
Work to date been challenging and the programme delivery status remains at risk.
Wholesale Line Rental WLR EoI RFS good faith gesture date 31 December 2006 This Undertaking is the largest in terms of the scale of the customer base.
The timescales for this task are proving to be extremely challenging and its delivery is at risk.
Ongoing Product KPIs By the end of 2006 07, IPStream, LLU and WLR for new customers should all be operating on EoI principles: IPStream for some 15 months.
The EAB will be examining whether the products KPIs demonstrate consistent levels of performance between all customers.
Ongoing behaviours As the Openreach and BT Wholesale product organisations mature and the early Undertakings deliverables move into business as usual, the EAB will be giving particular attention to whether BT has adopted appropriate behaviours.
In addition to looking at existing measures such as the Code of Practice training completions, it will examine how much the reality of doing day to day business with BT has changed since the inception of the Undertakings.
Next Generation Networks Whilst the Undertakings obligations for the EoI product deliverables are clear in most areas, obligations around BTs 21st Century Network 21CN are less straightforward.
The EAB will monitor how BT delivers its obligations in this area.
Conclusion This report concludes that satisfactory progress has been made to date and that the EAB is positioned to oversee BTs future performance.
