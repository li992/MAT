In particular, the Groups subsidiary Vodafone 2 is responding to an enquiry by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC with regard to the UK tax treatment of one of its Luxembourg holding companies under the controlled foreign companies CFC rules.
Further details in relation to this enquiry are included in note 31 Contingent Liabilities.
At 31 March 2006, the Group holds provisions of 1,822 million tax and 276 million interest in respect of the potential UK tax liability that may arise from this enquiry 2005: 1,600 million tax and 157 million interest.
Management considers these amounts are sufficient to settle any assessments that may result from the enquiry.
However, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and, therefore, could affect the overall profitability of the Group in future periods.
In the absence of any material unexpected developments, the provisions are likely to be reassessed when the views of the European Court of Justice become known.
