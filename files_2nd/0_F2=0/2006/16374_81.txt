Financial Statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management The Group has comprehensive policies in place, approved by the Boards, covering the use of derivative financial instruments.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes.
Established controls are in place covering all financial instruments.
These include policies, guidelines, exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting.
Performance is closely monitored with independent reviews undertaken by internal audit.
Hedge accounting principles are described in note 1 on page 74.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
Details of the instruments used for interest rate and foreign exchange exposure management, together with information on related exposures, are given below.
Unilevers interest rate management policy is described below.
The Groups exposure to interest rates is mainly xed by xed rate long-term debt issues and straightforward derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps.
In general, cash is invested short-term at oating interest rates.
At the end of 2006, interest rates were xed on approximately 48% of the projected net of cash and borrowing positions for 2007 and 52% for 2008 compared with 61% for 2006 and 49% for 2007 at the end of 2005.
The separate amounts shown as assets and liabilities are not indicative of the amount of credit risk to which the Group is exposed as we have netting agreements in place with our principal banks.
In case of a default, Unilever is allowed to net the assets and liabilities.
There was no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty.
Details of our policy for managing credit risk are given below.
In the assessment of hedge effectiveness the credit risk element on the underlying hedged item has been excluded.
Fair values of derivatives used as cash ow hedges, fair value hedges and in connection with purchases of own shares at 31 December 2006 amounted in total to assets of 23 million 2005: 62 million and liabilities of 9 million 2005: 22 million.
Of these amounts, the fair value of borrowing-related derivatives at 31 December 2006 was 5 million 2005: 46 million.

Hedge accounting is not applied to these relationships.
Of the fair values disclosed above, the fair value of borrowing-related derivatives at 31 December 2006 amounted to 323 million 2005: 45 million.
Additional information The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts represent the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts at the year-end forward exchange rates.
The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement', Unilever has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet specic requirements set out in the standard: no such embedded derivatives have been identied.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2006 99 Financial Statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of financial assets and financial liabilities.
All trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities other than finance lease creditors and provisions have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and currency proles in note 15 on page 95 and note 16 on page 96, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair value, because of their short-term nature.

Cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature.
The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value: non-listed bonds and other loans are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows associated with these instruments.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
Collateral Counterparties have deposited securities with a market value of 2 million 2005: 275 million as collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
Such collateral is not regarded as an asset of Unilever and is excluded from the balance sheet.
Commodity contracts Unilever purchases forward contracts to hedge future requirements for certain raw materials, almost always for physical delivery.
Futures contracts may also be used to hedge future price movements.
Treasury risk management Unilever manages a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and counterparty risks.
Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at optimising net interest cost and reducing volatility.
This is achieved by modifying the interest rate exposure of debt and cash positions through the use of interest rate swaps.
Fixed rate investments and borrowings give rise to a fair value interest rate risk.
The oating amounts give rise to a cash ow interest rate risk.
Because of Unilevers broad operational reach, it is subject to risks from changes in foreign currency values that could affect earnings.
As a practical matter, it is not feasible to fully hedge these uctuations.
Additionally, Unilever believes that most currencies of major countries in which it operates will equalise against the euro over time.
Unilever does have a foreign exchange policy that requires operating companies to manage trading and financial foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits.
This is achieved primarily through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Regional groups monitor compliance with this policy.
At the end of 2006, there was no material exposure from companies holding assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency.
In addition, as Unilever conducts business in many foreign currencies but publishes its financial statements and measures its performance in euros, it is subject to exchange risk due to the effects that exchange rate movements have on the translation of the underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
Unilever aims to minimise its foreign exchange exposure in operating companies by borrowing in the local currency, except where inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or local market conditions.
For those countries that, in the view of management, have a substantial retranslation risk, Unilever may hedge such net investment.
Nevertheless, from time to time, currency revaluations on unhedged investments will trigger exchange translation movements in the balance sheet.
100 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial Statements continued Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition to this, Unilever has committed credit facilities in place to support its commercial paper programmes and for general corporate purposes.
See note 16 on page 96 for further details of these credit facilities.
Counterparty exposures are minimised by restricting dealing counterparties to a limited number of financial institutions that have secure credit ratings, by working within agreed counterparty limits, by obtaining collateral for outstanding positions and by setting limits on the maturity of exposures.
Counterparty credit ratings are closely monitored and concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty is avoided.
There was no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty as at the year end.
Master netting agreements are in place for the majority of interest rate derivative instruments.
The risk in the event of default by a counterparty is determined by the extent to which market prices have moved since the contracts were made.
The Group believes that the risk of incurring such losses is remote.
Cash ow provides the funds to service the nancing of the business and enhance shareholder return.
A material and sustained shortfall in our cash ow could undermine our credit rating and overall investor confidence and could restrict the Groups ability to raise funding.
Sensitivity analysis The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the fair value of the financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments which the Group held at 31 December 2006, to hypothetical changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Interest rate sensitivity The fair values of debt, investments and related hedging instruments are affected by movements in interest rates.
The analysis shows the sensitivity of the fair value of interest rate-sensitive instruments to a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rates across all maturities.
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity The values of debt, investments and related hedging instruments, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities holding them, are subject to exchange rate movements.
The analysis shows the income statement sensitivity of these values to a hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates.
Sensitivity to a hypothetical 10% change in rates as at 31 December million million 2006 2005 Interest rate risk 167 193 Foreign exchange rate risk 16 30 The above-mentioned interest rate sensitivity relates to financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, with fair values amounting to 7 408 million at the end of 2006 2005: 11 186 million.
The above-mentioned foreign exchange rate risk relates to a value of financial instruments and derivatives of 164 million at the end of 2006 2005: 300 million.
Sensitivity to not applying hedge accounting Derivatives have to be reported at fair value.
Those derivatives used for cash ow hedging for which we do not apply hedge accounting will cause volatility in the income statement.
Such derivatives did not have a material impact on the 2006 income statement.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in interest rates As mentioned above on page 100, Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at optimising net interest costs and reducing volatility.
Part of the interest rates on funds and debt are not xed and are therefore subject to changes in oating interest rates.
The analysis shows the sensitivity of the income statement to a hypothetical one percentage point change in oating interest rates over both funds and debt on a full-year basis.
