Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental information The principal activity of the Group is the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products.
The management structure is based on geographical regions.
These geographical regions of UK, Germany, Rest of Western Europe and Rest of the World have been used as the primary reporting segments.
The manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products is a single integrated business and as a consequence, the Group has only one business segment and no secondary segment disclosure has been made.
The central costs are allocated to segments on the basis of revenue less duty.

com Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Segmental information continued Use of adjusted measures Management believes that reporting adjusted measures provides a better comparison of business performance for the year and reflects the way in which the business is controlled.
Accordingly, adjusted measures of profit from operations, net finance costs, profit before tax, taxation and earnings per share exclude, where applicable, restructuring costs, retirement benefit net financing income, fair value 80 gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and related taxation effects.
Reconciliations between adjusted and reported taxation are included in note 6 and between adjusted and reported earnings per share in note 8.
The term adjusted is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The principal adjustments made to reported profits are as follows: Restructuring costs These are significant one-off costs incurred in integrating acquired businesses and rationalisation initiatives.
Fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, the Group has decided not to apply hedge accounting as permitted under IAS 39 and we exclude fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments from adjusted measures where appropriate.
Retirement benefit net financing income The expected return on plan assets and the interest on retirement benefit liabilities is included within net finance costs.
Since these items do not impact cash flows and can be subject to significant volatility outside of managements control they have been eliminated from adjusted measures of net finance costs, profit before tax and earnings per share.

This amounts to 295m based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2006.
At the date of the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved the final dividend at the Annual General Meeting and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
com Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held to satisfy the Groups employee share schemes and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued on conversion into ordinary shares of rights held under the employee share schemes.

A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, presented at CGU level is shown as follows: 2006 2005 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with In s million Goodwill indefinite lives Goodwill indefinite lives UK 42 40 Germany 1,164 28 1,093 Rest of Western Europe 345 47 377 Rest of the World 1,549 293 1,592 Manufacturing 346 347 3,446 368 3,449 The goodwill in Germany and the Rest of the World arose principally on the acquisition of Reemtsma in 2002.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates and the long term growth rates.
The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital, while growth rates are based on managements experience and expectations and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the area in which the CGU operates.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a three-year period.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates.
The weighted average growth rates are consistent with forecasts and the discount rates are pre-tax.
No impairment charges were recognised in 2006 2005: nil.

com Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Intangible assets continued Acquisition of Davidoff cigarette trademark On 5 September 2006, the Group acquired the worldwide Davidoff cigarette trademark for a cash consideration of 368m.
The Group had been the long term licensee of the trademark following the acquisition of Reemtsma in 2002.
Given the global growth potential of the brand, the Directors consider that the Davidoff cigarette trademark has an indefinite life and it is therefore not subject to 86 amortisation.
It is, however, subject to an annual impairment review under the requirements of IAS 36.

The following disclosures are included as at 30 September 2006 in order to meet the requirements of IAS 32. i Management of financial risk The Group operates a centralised treasury function, Group Treasury, that is responsible for the management of the financing risks of the Group, together with its financing and liquidity requirements.
It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions, and is subject to policies and procedures approved by the Board.
A treasury sub-committee oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with the delegated authorities set out by the Board.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including provision of monthly treasury summaries and an annual review of strategy.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS.
The hedge accounting rules under IFRS are considerably more restrictive than the requirements under UK GAAP and while the Group continues to hedge underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner, the requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not being effective for hedge accounting purposes.
As a result, the Group has decided not to apply hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39.
The information contained in sections ii and iii below shows the underlying borrowing position before the effect of interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading denominated in foreign currencies, the foreign currency borrowings both pre and post cross currency swaps, the translation of the net assets of its foreign operations into the consolidated financial statements and foreign currency denominated costs.
In 2006, 74% of revenue less duty and 62% of profit from operations was in international markets.
Certain sales in these markets are invoiced in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling company, in particular Taiwanese dollars.
The Group uses foreign currency derivative instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to reduce exposure to the risk that these sales will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
As at 30 September 2006, there were 32m notional outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts.
The material foreign currency denominated costs include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency.
The Group has foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when consolidated into the Group financial statements.
A proportion of the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is managed through borrowings post cross currency swaps denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to its borrowings and cash deposits.
The most material risk is in respect of its borrowings.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which includes the fair value of the principal amounts due to be exchanged at maturity under cross currency swaps and excludes the fair value of interest rate derivatives and interest accruals.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Financial Statements 16 Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued i Management of financial risk continued Interest rate risk continued As at 30 September 2006, approximately 21% of adjusted net debt was denominated in sterling and 79% in Euro.
Accordingly, the Groups financial results are currently exposed to gains or losses arising from fluctuations in sterling and Euro interest rates.
In order 89 to manage its interest rate risk on the borrowings, the Group separates the borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into floating interest rate shortly after issue.
The Group then transacts interest rate swaps at other times for different notional amounts and different maturities to manage our exposure to interest rate risk.
As at 30 September 2006, 51% of adjusted net debt was at a floating rate of interest and 49% was at a fixed rate of interest.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk due to its trade receivables due from customers and cash deposits and financial instruments transacted with financial institutions.
The Group has some significant concentrations of credit risk from customers.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered to be necessary.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions.
The Group has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk arising from having insufficient funds available to enable it to meet the financing needs of the Group.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group.
As at 30 September 2006 the Group had 504m of undrawn committed facilities, maturing in 2010.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries, sourcing from various counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.

The bank borrowings are floating rate liabilities.
The majority bear interest at rates fixed in advance by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling and to EURIBOR in the case of Euro borrowings.
The capital market issuance in place at 30 September 2006 bears interest at a fixed rate until maturity.
The impact of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the resultant interest rate risk arising is shown in section iv overleaf.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Financial Statements 16 Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued iv Derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS.
The hedge accounting rules under IFRS are considerably more restrictive than the requirements under UK GAAP and while the Group continues 91 to hedge underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner, the requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not being effective for hedge accounting purposes.
The Group separates the borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into floating interest rate shortly after issue.
The following table sets out the derivative financial instruments held by the Group as at 30 September 2006, and demonstrates the Groups use of those derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposure.
The table presents the nominal value of such instruments used to calculate the contractual payments under such contracts, analysed by maturity date, together with the related weighted average interest rate where relevant.
Some of the interest rate swaps have embedded options and assumptions have been made based on market information and third party advice at 30 September 2006 to determine whether such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date.

Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
vi Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial liabilities that are carried in the financial statements at amounts other than fair values.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and derivative financial instruments are approximate to their fair value and so are excluded from the analysis below.

2005 UK GAAP disclosures The Group has exercised the exemption under IFRS 1 to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 October 2005 and to record financial instruments in the comparative period on the UK GAAP basis.

com Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued The loans maturing after five years are the 200m sterling bond which matures in December 2018 and the 350m sterling bond which matures in June 2012. i Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings and surplus cash.
In order to manage interest rate risk, the 94 Group maintains both fixed and floating rate debt and uses derivatives, including interest rate and cross currency swaps, to vary the mix.
The following table analyses the currency and interest composition of the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Fixed rate financial liabilities Weighted Weighted average period Floating rate Fixed rate average for which financial financial interest rate rate is fixed In s million unless otherwise indicated Total liabilities liabilities % Years Sterling 765 390 375 5.7 5.0 Euro 2,634 1,094 1,540 4.5 3.0 Australian dollar 115 85 30 4.7 0.5 US dollar 15 15 n a n a Other 10 9 1 9.1 2.0 3,539 1,593 1,946 4.7 3.3 The borrowings total above includes 57m in relation to cross currency swaps that have been reclassified to derivative financial instruments on the face of the balance sheet in accordance with IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings and capital market issuances post-derivatives.
The majority of bank borrowings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of one month by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling and three months in the case of Australian dollar borrowings and EURIBOR in the case of Euro borrowings.
The capital market issuance in place at the year end bears interest post-interest and currency swaps at rates fixed in advance for six months by reference to LIBOR in the case of the US dollar bond and for three months by reference to EURIBOR in the case of the sterling and Euro bonds.
The figures shown in the tables above take into account various interest rate and currency swaps.
Hence the US dollar denominated bond issued in 1999 is shown within the sterling balance, and the sterling bonds issued in 2002 and 2003 are shown in the Euro balance.
The fixed rate financial liabilities do not take into account forward start swaps, which may become effective after the balance sheet date.
ii Currency risk disclosure The Group is exposed to the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries into sterling, as well as the impact of transactions in foreign currencies.
On significant acquisitions of overseas companies, borrowings are raised in the local currency to minimise the translation risk.
For translation risk, where necessary, forward foreign exchange deals are entered into to hedge a proportion of the forecast foreign currency cash flows.
At 30 September 2005, 36.1m notional of forward foreign exchange deals were outstanding.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency at the balance sheet date: Functional currency of Group operation Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities In s million Sterling Euro US dollars Australian dollars Other Total Sterling 632 36 94 29 473 Euro 1 25 11 66 101 Other 11 27 54 28 64 12 605 65 83 65 510 iii Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.

The cash deposits earn interest at floating rates of interest and comprise mainly short term money market deposits with a maturity date not exceeding one year.
Credit risks on the amounts due from counterparties, in relation to cash deposits and other financial instruments, are managed by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any one counterparty, based on their credit rating.

3m 2005: 3m of assets related to the German unfunded schemes are not shown separately.
The derivation of the overall expected return on assets reflects the actual asset allocation at the measurement date combined with an expected return for each asset class.
The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on fixed interest gilts.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including: the income yield at the measurement date: the long term growth prospects for the economy in general: the long term relationship between each asset class and bond returns: and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
Excluding any self investment in the JP Morgan held portfolio, approximately 7m of the assets held by the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund are in respect of Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs own financial instruments.
None of this amount is known to relate to assets being used by Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.

The Group expects to contribute 16m to its funded defined benefit schemes in the year to 30 September 2007.
The main UK Group scheme is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the ITPF.
An actuarial valuation of the ITPF the triennial valuation, for funding purposes was made at 31 March 2004 by Watson Wyatt Limited.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.85% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.5% and 2.75% respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2004 the market value of the assets of the ITPF was 2,248m.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 108% of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
However, the assets were not sufficient to cover future service benefits for current members and, as a result of this deficiency, the Group recommenced payment of employers contributions during the 2004 2005 financial year at the level of 10m per year as set by the ITPF Actuary.
The financial position of the ITPF and the level of contributions to be paid will be reviewed at the next actuarial valuation, which is expected to be carried out at 31 March 2007. www.

During the period, the Group operated a number of share-based employee benefit schemes as follows: International Sharesave Plan Under the Plan the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs in the Company to non-UK employees who enter into a savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered varies depending on local laws, but for ordinary shares will not be less than 80% of the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation.
In respect of ADSs the price will not be less than 80% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the same day.
Options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after entering the Plan.
Under the UK Sharesave Scheme, which is part of the International Plan, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to UK employees who enter into an HM Revenue and Customs approved Save as You Earn SAYE savings contract.
The options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the Scheme.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Each year since demerger in 1996, annual awards have been made to Executive Directors and other senior executives under the LTIP.
The awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction of specified performance criteria, measured over a threeyear performance period.
All grants are at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee, with no employee having the right to receive such a grant.
Further information relating to the performance criteria and the terms of the scheme are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In respect of the November 2002 November 2005 award 100% of the award vested in full on 25 November 2005.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Financial Statements 21 Share schemes continued In respect of the November 2003 November 2006 award, it is expected that 100% of the award will vest on 18 November 2006.
Share Matching Scheme The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
105 For Executive Directors and most of the Groups management, individuals may elect to invest any proportion up to a maximum of 100% of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided that the shares elected for are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment with the Group, the participant would receive the original shares plus additional shares.
The matching ratio for bonuses is 1:1 to encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding in the Group.
There was an initiative in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited.
All employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided these shares are left in the Trusts, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20% for one years retention to a maximum of 100% if they are retained for five years.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust the Trusts have been established to acquire ordinary shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share-based employee benefit schemes.
At 30 September 2006, the Trusts held 4.2m 2005: 3.0m ordinary shares with a nominal value of 424,697, all acquired in the open market at a cost of 65.3m 2005: 31.3m.
The acquisition of shares by the Trusts has been financed by a gift of 19.2m and an interest-free loan of 110.8m.
None of the ESOT shares has been allocated to employees or Directors as at 30 September 2006.
All finance costs and administration expenses connected with the ESOTs are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.

The fair and book values of the net assets acquired were 2m, giving rise to goodwill of 11m.
Full IFRS 3 disclosures have not been presented as these acquisitions are not considered significant to the Group as a whole.
The acquisition of the worldwide Davidoff cigarette trademark announced in August 2006 has, in accordance with IFRS 3, not been treated as a business combination as the substance of the transaction is the purchase of an intangible asset.
This is dealt with in note 9 Intangible Assets.

2005 acquisitions Skruf Snus AB During 2005 the Group acquired interests in a number of small businesses, including a 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB.
The acquisition agreement relating to the 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB includes a commitment to acquire the remaining shares by mid 2009 and provides the Group with control of the operating and financial policies of Skruf Snus AB including its dividend policy.
Accordingly the acquisition is accounted for as a 100% subsidiary to reflect the substance of the transaction.

Subsequent to releasing the restated 2005 results, it was decided to reclassify certain advertising and promotion expenditure and net pension benefit financing income within the income statement.
These changes do not affect the reported profit before tax.
Full details of this change can be found in the interim report for the six months ended 31 March 2006, which is available from www.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2006 Financial Statements 30 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Explanatory notes 1.
Advertising and promotion expenditure Certain advertising and promotion expenditure that is linked to volumes sold 26m has been reclassified within our income statement and deducted from revenue rather than included in other operating charges.
These changes did not impact the reported profit before tax.
Post-employment benefits 115 Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for post-employment benefits under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24, whereby the cost of providing pensions was charged to the profit and loss account over the service lives of employees.
Any variances arising from actuarial valuations were charged or credited to profit over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees.
Under IFRS, the assets and liabilities of each defined benefit scheme are valued at each balance sheet date to produce, for each scheme, a net asset or liability for recognition on the balance sheet.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
All other service and interest costs and the expected return on assets are recognised in the income statement.
This treatment is in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 and endorsed by the EU on 8 November 2005, and brings the methodology of IAS 19 substantially into line with Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17.
This means that subject to presentation and minor valuations differences, the impacts are similar to those given in the FRS 17 disclosures provided under UK GAAP.
The impact on retained profit for the year ended 30 September 2005 is an increase of 14m, offset by 2m of related deferred tax.
Intangible assets goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill on the balance sheet was amortised over its useful economic life.
Under IFRS 3, amortisation of goodwill is prohibited, instead it is subject to an impairment review which must be carried out at least annually and whenever there is an indicator of impairment.
Following the adoption of IFRS, the goodwill asset with a value as at 1 October 2004 of 3,452m will no longer be amortised.
The results for the year ended 30 September 2005 were restated to reverse the goodwill amortisation charge of 198m that was recorded under UK GAAP in order to restate the goodwill to the 1 October 2004 valuation.
Impairment reviews carried out at 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005 in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets identified no impairments.
Intangible assets other Under UK GAAP, all computer software was included within tangible fixed assets in the balance sheet, however, under IFRS only software integral to another fixed asset should be included in tangible fixed assets.
Any separately identifiable software must be classified as an intangible asset.
The charge to the income statement in respect of such software is classified as amortisation under IFRS rather than as depreciation under UK GAAP.
As at 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005, 9m and 11m respectively of software was reallocated to intangible assets.
A 7m charge for depreciation for the year ended 30 September 2005 has been reclassified as amortisation in respect of this software for the year ended 30 September 2005.
Proposed final dividends Under UK GAAP, proposed final dividends were accrued as an adjusting post balance sheet event in the accounting period to which they related.
Under IFRS dividends are recognised in the period in which they are approved.
As a result, the proposed final dividend of 278m for the year ended 30 September 2005 included in the balance sheet and profit and loss account under UK GAAP is not recognised in the statements prepared under IFRS.
Similarly, there is an adjustment to the opening balance sheet at 1 October 2004 of 253m representing the 2004 final dividend which is recognised in the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2005 under IFRS.
Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised a charge to the profit and loss account for its share option schemes over the performance period based on the difference between the exercise price of the award and the share price at the date of grant the intrinsic value.
Under IFRS, the charge is based on the fair value of the share options awarded at the date of grant spread over the vesting period.
There is an adjustment to the opening balance sheet at 1 October 2004 of 1m between the profit and loss reserve and the IFRS transition reserve.
The impact of this change is to increase operating profit for the year ended 30 September 2005 by 4m, with the other side of the accounting entry being a debit to shareholders funds as a reserves movement.
There is therefore no impact on net assets.
Tax IAS 12 Income Taxes covers the accounting requirements for both current and deferred taxation.
There is no difference in the current tax accounting requirements under IAS 12, compared with those of UK GAAP.
However there are differences in the requirements for accounting for deferred tax under IFRS rather than under UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was recognised only on timing differences arising from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods that differed from those in which those gains and losses were included in the financial statements.
Under IFRS, except for specific exemptions, deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences, which include timing differences, arising from the difference between the tax base and accounting base of balance sheet items.
The Group has made adjustments to the balance sheets at 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005 as follows: an adjustment of 7m to reflect deferred tax on fair value adjustments made to property valuations as a result of the Reemtsma acquisition: a further adjustment of 6m in respect of deferred tax on gains rolled over into replacement assets.
Further adjustments to the deferred tax liability were made as a result of the adoption of the IFRS requirements for accounting for post-employment benefits as outlined in 2 above.
Holiday pay accrual When reporting under UK GAAP, the Group did not account for holiday pay accruals except where it was legally obliged to make a cash settlement.
IAS 19 Employee benefits explicitly requires provision to be made for the cost of holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.
The effect of this change of approach is to reduce net assets as at both 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005 by 10m.
Spare parts Under UK GAAP, all spare parts held for plant and machinery were held within inventories and expensed when used.
Under IFRS, certain spare parts should be held within fixed assets and transferred to the relevant asset as required and subsequently depreciated accordingly.
As at 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005, spare parts valued at 23m and 21m respectively were reclassified from inventories to property, plant and equipment.
This change had no effect on the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2005. www.

Financial instruments The Group undertakes transactions in derivative financial instruments in order to manage the underlying exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Foreign currency borrowings are also used to hedge foreign exchange risk.
IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates Under UK GAAP, where cross currency swaps are used to hedge exchange risk, the book value of the underlying debt reflects the effect of the swap.
However, under 116 IAS 21, the book value of such derivatives is shown separately on the balance sheet and the underlying debt is translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
As a result of this change, 57m was reallocated to derivative financial instruments in liabilities, reducing borrowings.
IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement Under UK GAAP, hedge accounting was applied to derivative financial instruments such that changes in the market value of the instrument were matched against changes in the value of the underlying hedged exposure.
With the exception of cross currency swaps, the instruments were kept off-balance sheet with their impact disclosed in a note to the financial statements.
IAS 39 requires all derivatives to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the IFRS hedge accounting rules, which are much more restrictive than those under UK GAAP.
In preparing the comparative figures for 2005, the Group has chosen to utilise the IFRS 1 exemption from the requirement to restate comparative information for IAS 32 and IAS 39 on financial instruments.
Therefore, in the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the year ended 30 September 2005, the Group has continued to apply the hedge accounting rules of UK GAAP.
Restatement of consolidated balance sheet to include IAS 32 and IAS 39 as at 1 October 2005 From 1 October 2005, the Group is required to account for its financial instruments in accordance with the measurement criteria of IAS 39 and has recognised transitional adjustments for the following at this date: a The measurement of all derivative financial instruments at fair value: b The reclassification of interest accruals to form part of the carrying value of the related cash or borrowings: and c Deferred tax on adjustments a and b.
Although the Group has taken the decision not to hedge account for its derivative financial instruments, it is deemed to have applied hedge accounting under UK GAAP until 30 September 2005 and discontinued hedge accounting prospectively thereafter.
Detailed below is a reconciliation between the IFRS restated balance sheet at 30 September 2005 applying prior UK GAAP hedge accounting and the balance sheet after the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
From 1 October 2005 all derivative financial instruments will continue to be recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with future gains and losses being recognised immediately in earnings.
