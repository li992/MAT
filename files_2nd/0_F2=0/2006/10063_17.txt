MELROSE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 55 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 12 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued Goodwill has been allocated to the business segments, each of which comprises several cash generating units as follows: 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 m m Dynacast 157.8 174.7 OEM 112.5 128.3 Aftermarket 1.0 3.8 MVC 16.1 18.3 MPC PSM 20.4 23.3 307.8 348.4 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
The growth rates are based on a prudent estimate of industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows for the following nineteen years 20 years in total based on estimated growth rates of between 2% and 5%.
Due to the loss in the MVC division, a three year plan has been agreed which has then been extended by 17 years at a 2% growth rate.
This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The discount rate applied is 12%.

The impact of the change of discount rate resulted in a 0.1 million credit to the income statement.
Environmental remediation provisions relate to the estimated clean up costs of pollution, groundwater contamination and legal costs at certain subsidiaries.
Factory closure costs at 31 December 2006 relate mainly to the closure of the Dynacast operations at Spartanburg in the USA.

2006 2005 m m Deferred tax liabilities 18.6 19.9 Deferred tax assets 29.8 29.1 11.2 9.2 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 204 million 2005: 183 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 58 million 2005: 29 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 146 million 2005: 153.9 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to certain continuity of business requirements.
A significant part of the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group accounts relates to the McKechnie Pension Plan.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this obligation due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the United Kingdom.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1.5 million 2005: 0.6 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

24 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Prior to the acquisition, McKechnie and Dynacast had established a number of pension schemes covering many of its employees and operating in several jurisdictions.
The most significant schemes are: The McKechnie Pension Plan the Plan which provides defined benefit pensions for its members.
The assets of the Plan are held in a fund administered by McKechnie Pension Trust Limited, an independent trustee company.
An actuarial valuation of the Plan was carried out at 31 December 2005 by a qualified independent actuary.
Plan assets are stated at their bid value at 31 December 2006.
The Dynacast and MVC Pension Schemes in the US are closed funded schemes of a defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
In Germany and Austria, unfunded defined benefit arrangements are operated by Dynacast.
There are also obligations to provide post retirement healthcare to former employees of MVC and to provide termination indemnities in Italy, France, Mexico and Korea to former Dynacast employees.

25 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits and trade and other receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Fair values The Directors consider that the financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.

Two contracts with total nominal values of US $219.3 million 111.8 million and fair value of 0.8 million have fixed interest rates at an average rate of 4.09% for periods up to July 2007.
