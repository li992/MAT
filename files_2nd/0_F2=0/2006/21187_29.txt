Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 224 Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits continued Basis of preparation EEV basis The summarised consolidated income statement and balance sheet on pages 220 to 222 present the Groups results and financial position for the life and related businesses on the European Embedded Value EEV basis and for its non-life businesses on the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis.
The EEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the EEV Principles introduced by the CFO Forum in May 2004 and the Additional Guidance on EEV Disclosures published by the CFO Forum in October 2005 applicable for financial reporting for the year ending 31 December 2006.
In the Directors opinion, the EEV basis provides a more accurate reflection of the performance of the Groups life and related operations year on year than results presented under the IFRS basis.
The Directors consider that the EEV methodology represents a more meaningful basis of reporting the underlying value of the Groups life and related businesses and the underlying drivers of performance.
This basis allows for the impact of uncertainty in the future investment returns more explicitly and is consistent with the way the business is priced and managed.
The Groups approach to establishing economic assumptions specifically investment returns, required capital and discount rates was reviewed by Tillinghast, a firm of actuarial consultants, at the time of adopting the EEV principles in 2004.
The approach is based on the well established capital asset pricing model theory and is in line with the EEV Principles and Guidance.
The results for 2006 and 2005 have been audited by our auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
Their report in respect of 2006 is included in the Report and Accounts on page 219 of this document.
Covered business The EEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share of the other life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release business written in the UK.
The Groups definition of new business under EEV includes contracts that meet the definition of non-participating investment contracts under IFRS.
Covered business includes the Groups share of our joint venture operations including our arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG and our operations in India and China.
In addition, the results of Group companies providing significant administration, investment management and other services and of Group holding companies have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Together these businesses are referred to as Life and related businesses.
New business premiums New business premiums include: premiums arising from the sales of new contracts during the year: non-contractual additional premiums, including future Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate premiums: and expected renewals on new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to new contracts.
For products sold to individuals, premiums are generally considered to represent new business in certain circumstances, including where a new contract has been signed, or where underwriting has been performed.
Renewal premiums include contractual renewals, non-contractual variations that are reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-defined and reasonably predictable.
For group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts.
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates.
Foreign exchange adjustments Embedded value and other balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies have been translated to sterling using the appropriate closing exchange rate.
New business contribution and other income statement items have been translated using an average exchange rate for the relevant period.
The exchange rates adopted in this announcement are shown on page 120.
EEV methodology Overview Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products defined within covered business.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Calculation of the embedded value The shareholders interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business.
Calculations are performed separately for each business and are based on the cash flows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group reinsurance.
Where one life business has an interest in another life business, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the dependent company.
The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known changes.
Profits are then grossed up for tax at the full rate of corporation tax for the UK and at an appropriate rate for each of the other countries based on opening year tax rates.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 225 EEV methodology continued Net worth The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-admissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
Required capital is reported net of implicit items permitted on a local regulatory basis to cover minimum solvency margins which are assessed at a local entity basis.
The level of required capital for each business, which ranges between 100% and 150% of the EU minimum solvency requirement for our main European businesses and 250% of the EU minimum equivalent solvency requirements in the US, reflects the level of capital considered by the Directors to be appropriate to manage the business, allowing for our internal assessment of the level of market, insurance and operating risk inherent in the underlying products.
The same definition of required capital is used for both existing and new business.
The free surplus comprises the market value of shareholder assets in excess of local statutory reserves and required capital.
Value of in-force covered business The value of in-force covered business is the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate which incorporates a risk margin of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best estimate basis, less a deduction for the cost of holding the required level of capital.
In the UK, shareholders distributable profits arise when they are released following actuarial valuations.
These valuations are carried out in accordance with statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions.
Releases to shareholders arising in future years from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using best estimate assumptions of future experience.
In overseas businesses generally, there are similar requirements restricting payments to shareholders from life businesses.
The value of in-force covered business includes an allowance for the impact of financial options and guarantees arising from best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value and from additional costs related to the variability of investment returns the time value.
The intrinsic value is included in the underlying value of the in-force covered business using deterministic assumptions.
The time value of financial options and guarantees has been determined using stochastic modelling techniques.
Stochastic modelling typically involves projecting the future cash flows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.
Allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates.
The time value is determined by deducting the average value of shareholder cash flows under these economic scenarios from the deterministic shareholder value under best estimate assumptions.
The cost of holding required capital is the difference between the required capital and the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate of the projected release of the required capital and investment earnings on the assets deemed to back the required capital.
Where the required capital is covered by policyholder assets, for example in the UK with-profit funds, there is no impact of cost of capital on shareholder value.
The assets regarded as covering the required capital are those that the operation deems appropriate.
The value of in-force covered business includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business.
This is referred to as the look through into service company expenses.
In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or maintaining covered business have been allowed for.
Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.
Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 226 Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits continued EEV methodology continued Risk discount rates Under the EEV methodology, a risk discount rate RDR is required to express a stream of expected future distributable profits as a single value at a particular date the present value.
It is the interest rate that an investment equal to the present value would have to earn in order to be able to replicate exactly the stream of future profits.
The RDR is a combination of a risk free rate to reflect the time value of money plus a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from that assumed.
In particular, a risk margin is added to allow for the risk that expected additional returns on certain asset classes e. g. equities are not achieved.
Risk discount rates for our life businesses have been calculated using a risk margin based upon a Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The Group WACC is calculated using a gross risk free interest rate, an equity risk margin, a market assessed risk factor beta, and an allowance for the gearing impact of debt financing including subordinated debt on a market value basis.
The market assessed risk factor captures the markets view of the effect of all types of risk on our business, including operational and other non-economic risk.
The RDR is only one component of the overall allowance for risk in EEV calculations.
Risk is also allowed for in the cost of holding statutory reserving margins, additional required capital and in the time value of options and guarantees.
Hence to derive the RDR the Group WACC is adjusted to reflect the average level of required capital assumed to be held, and to reflect the explicit valuation of the time value of options and guarantees.
In order to derive risk discount rates for each of our life businesses, the adjusted Group WACC is expressed as a risk margin in excess of the gross risk free interest rate used in the WACC calculation as described above.
This risk margin is used for all our main businesses including the US.
Business-specific discount rates are then calculated as the sum of this risk margin and the appropriate local gross risk free rate at the valuation date, based on returns on government bonds.
A common risk free rate, and hence a common RDR, is used for all of our businesses within the Eurozone.
Additional country-specific risk margins are applied to smaller businesses to reflect additional economic, political and business-specific risk.
For example, risk margins ranging from 3.7% to 8.7% are applied to the Groups eastern European and Asian operations.
Within each business, a constant RDR has been applied in all future time periods and in each of the economic scenarios underlying the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees.
At each valuation date, the risk margin is reassessed based on current economic factors and is updated only if a significant change has occurred.
In particular, changes in risk profile arising from movements in asset mix are allowed for via the updated risk margin calculation.
Following the review of the risk margin at 31 December 2006, the Directors have decided to leave the life embedded value risk margin unchanged at 2.7%.
The market assessed risk factor beta has reduced in recent periods, implying a reduction of the risk in the life business.
Management will keep the risk margin under review and will make adjustments as necessary to reflect past trends and future expected trends in the riskiness of the life business, based on the beta.
The sensitivity disclosures on page 240 indicate the impact to the embedded value that would arise from a change in the risk discount rate.
Participating business Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected future returns on assets deemed to back the policies.
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
However, under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the Groups with-profit funds are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims.
The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
For profit sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benefits and shareholder value depend on the timing of realising gains, apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders benefits and shareholders reflect contractual requirements as well as existing practice.
Where under certain economic scenarios additional shareholder injections are required to meet policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
Consolidation adjustments The effect of transactions between our life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements has been included in results split by territory in a consistent manner.
No elimination is required on consolidation.
As the EEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the Groups life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have been removed from the relevant segment non insurance or fund management and are instead included within the results of life and related businesses.
In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the IFRS basis to the EEV basis.
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and new business contribution calculations for the relevant territory, but the net assets representing historical profits and other amounts remain under non insurance or fund management.
In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each segment with the assets on the opening and closing balance sheets, a transfer of IFRS profits from life and related business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur.
An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our holding companies.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 227 Components of life EEV return The life EEV return comprises the following components: new business contribution written during the period including value added between the point of sale and end of the period: the profit from existing business equal to: the expected return on the value of the in-force covered business at the beginning of the period, experience variances caused by the differences between the actual experience during the period and expected experience based on the operating assumptions used to calculate the start of year value, the impact of changes in operating assumptions including risk margins: the expected investment return on the shareholders net worth, based upon assumptions applying at the start of the year: investment return variances caused by differences between the actual return in the period and the expected return based on economic assumptions used to calculate the start of year value: and the impact of changes in economic assumptions in the period.
The life EEV operating return comprises the first three of these components and is calculated using economic assumptions as at the start of the year and operating demographic, expenses and tax assumptions as at the end of the year.

Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 228 Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits continued New business contribution The following tables set out the premium volumes and contribution from new business written by the life and related businesses, consistent with the definition of new business set out on page 224.
The contribution generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after tax distributable profit from that business.
New business contribution before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution after tax at the full corporation tax rate for UK business and at appropriate rates of tax for other countries.
New business contribution has been calculated using the same economic assumptions as those used to determine the embedded value as at the start of the year and operating assumptions used to determine the embedded value as at the end of the year, and is rolled forward to the end of the financial period.
New business contribution is shown before and after the effect of required capital, calculated on the same basis as for in-force covered business.
New business sales are expressed on two bases: annual premium equivalent APE and the present value of new business premiums PVNBP.
The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the year plus the discounted value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts, and is expressed at the point of sale.
The premium volumes and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are the same as those used to calculate new business contribution, so the components of the new business margin are on a consistent basis.
New business margin represents the ratio of new business contribution before the effect of required capital to PVNBP, expressed as a percentage.

Analysis of movement in life and related businesses embedded value The following tables provide an analysis of the movement in embedded value for the life and related businesses for 2006 and 2005.
The analysis is shown separately for net worth and the value of in-force covered business, and includes amounts transferred between these categories.
The transfer to life and related businesses from other segments consists of service company profits and losses during the reported period that have emerged from the value of in-force.
Since the look through into service companies includes only future profits and losses, these amounts must be eliminated from the closing embedded value.
All figures are shown net of tax.

Required capital has increased in the year by 866 million.
The movement comprises an increase of 553 million in relation to new business written, a reduction of 188 million in relation to in-force business, 607 million additional in-force required capital relating to acquisitions during the year and a reduction of 106 million in relation to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The decrease in the in-force required capital includes the impact of PS06 14 on the amount of shareholder capital required to support the business and the effect of the increase in long-term interest rates, which has decreased statutory reserves and, therefore, capital requirements.

Exceptional expenses in the UK reflect 32 million relating to the ongoing transformation of the life business and 117 million of other exceptional and project costs associated with strategic initiatives, including developments designed to improve the future new business volumes, and regulatory changes.
In the Netherlands, exceptional expenses reflect higher project costs compared to allowances as well as the payment to ABN AMRO in respect of the joint venture operations.
Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumptions set across many of our businesses.
Lapse experience in the UK has been worse than assumed and primarily relates to bonds and pensions.
In Poland, lapses for both life and pension products have been lower than assumed resulting in the favourable experience variances.
In the UK, other experience profits include better than assumed default experience on corporate bonds and mortgages and the benefit of higher than expected performance fees in Morley.
Maintenance expenses in UK relate to Morleys change in profit margin.
The change in Delta Lloyd is driven by improved asset management profitability.
The adverse movement in the US is due to a reassessment of expenses in Boston-based operations.
In the UK, exceptional expenses relate to short-term project costs and capitalisation of reorganisation costs.
Ireland reflects changes in expense assumptions regarding the future attribution of investment income and expenses between policyholders and shareholders.
The change in mortality assumptions in the UK includes an alignment in the basis for internal business.
Mortality assumptions in France were changed following improvements in mortality experience over the last few years.
In the UK, the lapse assumption change relates to bonds and pension business while the change in Ireland relates to the Celebration Bond and unit-linked bonds.
In France, lapse assumptions have been changed for non-AFER business in Aviva Vie.
In Spain, lapse assumptions have been changed for risk business and some savings products.
In the UK, the assumption changes reflect the beneficial impact of the with-profit funds sharing the pension scheme deficit funding 126 million and the impact of PS06 14, primarily in reducing the non-profit reserves 50 million.
In Delta Lloyd the impact is due to changes to management fee rebates.

Exceptional expenses in the UK reflect 47 million relating to ongoing transformation of the life business and 101 million of other exceptional and project costs associated with regulatory change and strategic initiatives.
Mortality experience continues to be better than assumed across most of our businesses, and particularly for protection business in the UK, AFER and unit-linked business in France and group business in the Netherlands.
Lapse experience in the UK has been worse than assumed and mainly relates to bonds and pension business.
In Ireland, the adverse persistency has mainly arisen on unit-linked pensions business.
In the UK, other experience profits includes better than assumed default experience on corporate bonds and commercial mortgages.
Mortality assumptions have been revised in the Netherlands following the publication of new annuitant mortality tables used for group business.
In the UK, the adverse lapse assumption change reflects a more prudent allowance for future persistency experience in the UK following recent experience.
In Ireland, the lapse assumption change mainly relates to unit-linked pension business.
Lapse assumption changes in the Netherlands largely relate to group business in the intermediary division.
Other operating assumption changes in the UK primarily relate to the change in annuitant required capital to 150% of required minimum margins which results in a 110 million one-off benefit.
In France other operating assumptions represent an allowance for further tax benefits arising from dividends from subsidiaries.
In the Netherlands, they reflect a variety of changes including increased annual management fees on unit-linked contracts, favourable change in asset mix, and the reduction of future guaranteed returns on group pensions business in Belgium.
In Poland it was previously assumed that the introduction of new individual pension products would lead to significant conversion of existing policies.
The prudent allowance made for this is no longer required.

The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields to obtain investment return assumptions for ordinary shares and property and to produce risk discount rates.
Additional country-specific risk margins are applied to smaller businesses to reflect additional economic, political and business-specific risk, which result in the application of risk margins ranging from 3.7% to 8.7% in our eastern European and Asian business operations.
Expense inflation is derived as a fixed margin above a local measure of long-term price inflation.
Risk free rates and price inflation have been harmonised across territories within the Euro currency zone, except for expense inflation in Ireland where significant differences remain.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent.
Investment return assumptions are generally derived by major product class, based on hypothecating the assets at the valuation date.
Future assumed reinvestment rates are consistent with implied market returns at 31 December 2006.
Rates have been derived using rates from the current yield curve at a duration based on the term of the liabilities, or directly from forward yield curves where considered appropriate.
Assumptions about future investment mix are consistent with long-term plans.
In most cases, the investment mix is assumed to continue unchanged throughout the projection period.
The changes in assumptions between reporting dates reflect the actual movements in risk free yields in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone and other territories.
For service companies, expense inflation relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life company.
Future returns on corporate fixed interest investments are calculated from prospective yields less an adjustment for credit risk.
Required capital in the United Kingdom is 150% EU minimum for Norwich Union Annuity Limited and 100% for other companies.
Required capital in Spain is 125% EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 110% for bancassurance companies.
The level of required capital for the US business is 250% of the risk based capital at the company action level set by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The required capital is equivalent to 5% of the insurance liabilities on a local regulatory basis which is broadly equivalent to the required capital we hold for our main European businesses.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions and Avivas medium-term bonus plans.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at the current rate of one ninth of the cost of bonus.
Principal economic assumptions stochastic calculations The time value of options and guarantees calculation allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix and bonus rates.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
This section describes the models used to generate future investment simulations, and gives some sample statistics for the simulations used.
Two separate models have been used, for the UK businesses and for International businesses, as each of these models better reflect the characteristics of the businesses.
United Kingdom Model Overall asset returns have been generated assuming that the portfolio total return has a lognormal distribution.
The mean and standard deviation of the overall asset return have been calculated using the evolving asset mix of the fund and assumptions over the mean and standard deviation of each asset class, together with correlations between them.
Asset Classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term fixed rate bonds.
The most significant assumption is the distribution of future long-term interest rates, since this is the most important factor in the cost of guaranteed annuity options.
Summary Statistics The following table sets out the means and standard deviations StDev of future returns at 31 December 2006 for the three most significant asset classes.
Interest rates are assumed to have a lognormal distribution with an annualised standard deviation of 12.5% p. a. for the natural logarithm of the interest rate.
Means have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, averaging the accumulation across all simulations, and converting the result to an equivalent annual rate by taking the nth root of the average accumulation minus 1.
Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, taking the natural logarithm of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
This makes the result comparable to implied volatilities quoted in investment markets.
Depending on the duration of the portfolio.
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 239 Principal economic assumptions deterministic calculations continued For the UK, the statistics are the same over all projection horizons.
Assumptions are also required for correlations between asset classes.
These have been set based on an assessment of historical data.
Returns for corporate fixed interest investments in each scenario are equal to the return on Government bonds plus a fixed additional amount, based on current spreads less a margin for credit risk.
International Model Government nominal interest rates are generated by a model that projects a full yield curve at annual intervals.
The model assumes that the logarithm of the short rate follows a mean reverting process subject to two normally distributed random shocks.
This ensures that nominal interest rates are always positive, the distribution of future interest rates remains credible, and the model can be calibrated to give a good fit to the initial yield curve.
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on 1-year bonds plus an excess return.
The excess return is assumed to have a lognormal distribution.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
Asset Classes The most important assets are fixed rate bonds of various durations.
In some businesses equities are also an important asset class.
Summary Statistics The following table sets out the means and standard deviations of future euro and US dollars returns at 31 December 2006 for the three most significant asset classes: equities in the case of Euro, short-term bonds defined to be of 1-year duration and long-term bonds defined to be 10-year zero coupon bonds.
In the accumulation of 10-year bonds, it is assumed that these are held for one year, sold as 9-year bonds then the proceeds are reinvested in 10-year bonds, although in practice businesses follow more complex asset strategies or tend to adopt a buy and hold strategy.
Correlations between asset classes have been set using the same approach as described for the United Kingdom.
Other assumptions Taxation Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered, except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience.
Where appropriate, surrender and option take up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the EEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-force and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identified separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to businesses included in the European Embedded Value calculations, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and new business contribution.
Valuation of debt Borrowings in the EEV consolidated balance sheet are valued on an IFRS basis, consistent with the primary financial statements.
At 31 December 2006 the market value of the Groups external debt, subordinated debt, preference shares including General Accident plc preference shares of 250 million classified as minority interests and direct capital instrument was 5,991 million 31 December 2005: 5,868 million.

Sensitivity analysis economic assumptions The tables below show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2006 and the new business contribution before the effect of required capital for 2006 to: one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rates: one percentage point increase and decrease in interest rates, including all consequential changes including assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : one percentage point increase and decrease in the assumed investment returns for equity and property investments, excluding any consequential changes to the risk discount rate: 10% rise and fall in market value of equity and property assets not applicable for new business contribution : and decrease in the level of required capital to 100% EU minimum or equivalent not applicable for new business contribution.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.
For example, future bonus rates are automatically adjusted to reflect sensitivity changes to future investment returns.
Some of the sensitivity scenarios may have consequential effects on valuation bases, where the basis for certain blocks of business is actively updated to reflect current economic circumstances.
Consequential valuation impacts on the sensitivities are allowed for where an active valuation basis is used.
Where businesses have a target asset mix, the portfolio is re-balanced after a significant market movement otherwise no re-balancing is assumed.

In addition, other factors can have a material impact, such as the nature of the options and guarantees, as well as the types of investments held.
The interest rate sensitivity will vary significantly by territory, depending on the type of business written: for example, where non-profit business is well matched by backing assets, the favourable impact of reducing the risk discount rate is the dominant factor.
Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees.
Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the sensitivities where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios.
This can be seen in the sensitivity of a 1% movement in the interest rate for the Netherlands, where there is a significant amount of business with investment return guarantees.
The increase of 70 basis points to the assumed pre-tax investment returns at 31 December 2006 has significantly decreased this sensitivity, reflecting the level of the guarantees relative to the interest rate assumption.
Sensitivities to a 1% movement in the equity property return will only impact the value of the in-force covered business, whereas a 10% movement in equity property values may impact both the net worth and the value of in-force, depending on the allocation of assets.

Where there is a look through into service company expenses, the fee charged by the service company is unchanged while the underlying expense decreases: 10% decrease in lapse rates a 10% sensitivity on a base assumption of 5% pa would represent a lapse rate of 4.5%pa : 5% decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates disclosed separately for life assurance and annuity business.
No future management actions are modelled in reaction to the changing non-economic assumptions.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged.
No changes to valuation bases have been included.
