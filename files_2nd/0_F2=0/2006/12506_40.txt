Retirement benefit schemes Defined Benefit Schemes Most Group companies participate in the Premier Foods Pension Scheme the PFPS, the principal funded defined benefit scheme operated by the Group.
The Group also operates a smaller funded defined benefit scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme the PAPPS for employees in the Ambrosia business.
Under the schemes, employees are entitled to retirement benefits which vary as a percentage of final salary on retirement.
No unfunded post-retirement benefits exist.
In addition, on 14 August 2006 the Group inherited two further funded defined benefit pension schemes as a result of the acquisition of Campbells, the Premier Grocery Products Pension Scheme PGPPS for the UK business, and the Premier Grocery Products Ireland Pension Scheme PGPIPS for the Irish business.
The exchange rates used to translate the Campbells Ireland scheme which is denominated in Euros are 1.4817 for the opening position at 14 August 2006, 1.4832 for the average rate during the year, and 1.493 for the closing position at 31 December 2006.
The assets of all four schemes are held by the trustees of the respective schemes and are independent of the Group's finances.
The schemes invest through investment managers appointed by the trustees in UK and European equities and in investment products comprising a broader range of assets.
For the purposes of these financial statements, pension costs presented are calculated by independent, qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The results for PFPS and PAPPS and the results for PGPPS and PGPIPS are combined on page 94.
