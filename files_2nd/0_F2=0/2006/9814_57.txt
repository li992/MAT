WDB 38-92 artwork 12 12 06 4:00 pm Page 36 W&DB GROUP ACCOUNTS 17 NOTES 37 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS On 9 August 2005 the Group entered into a Tax Deed of Covenant, the primary objective of which is to ensure that the Group does not trigger a total fide-grouping liability of 173.2m, of which 136.0m relates to Capital Gains Tax CGT and 37.2m relates to Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT.
This would arise in the event of W&DB Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group within six years for CGT purposes and three years for SDLT purposes.
The Directors consider the likelihood of such a sale to be remote.
The Group has provided guarantees to Barclays Bank PLC in relation to loans entered into by tenants to finance the purchase of certain fixtures and fittings.
The total amount guaranteed under these arrangements is 1.4m 2005: 1.1m.
The Group has also entered into a Deed of Guarantee with the Trustees of The Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries, PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme The Scheme whereby it guarantees to the Trustees the ongoing obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme, and the obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme in the event of a debt becoming due under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 on the occurrence of either a Group company entering liquidation or the Scheme windingup.
38 EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE On 1 December 2006 the Group announced its intention to proceed with a four-for-one share split, subject to shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting on 8 January 2007.
The nominal value of the shares will change from 29.5p to 7.375p.
If the share split had applied for the period ended 30 September 2006, basic earnings per share and basic earnings per share before exceptional items would have been 23.8p.

Hence revenue has been reduced by 41.2m with a a corresponding reduction in operating expenses.
b The defined benefit pension schemes were previously accounted for under SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs, together with the a disclosures required by FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Had the transition to IFRS not taken place the Group would have been required a to adopt FRS 17 in full for the period ended 30 September 2006.
The Group now accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 a Employee benefits.
a Under SSAP 24 the Group recognised a prepayment of 28.7m at 1 October 2005 2004: creditor of 1.5m in relation to the a W&DB defined benefit pension scheme, representing payments made in excess of actuary-assessed requirements.
A further liability a of 3.3m was recognised at 1 October 2005 in relation to the Burtonwood and Jennings schemes.
IAS 19 requires the Group to a recognise the pension liability in full at each balance sheet date, which stood at 66.2m and 45.6m at 2 October 2004 and 1 October a 2005 respectively.
a The transition from SSAP 24 to IAS 19 also required the recognition of a finance cost of 2.6m, being the interest on pension scheme a liabilities less the expected return on pension assets, and a credit of 2.0m to operating expenses, being an adjustment to the service a cost of the schemes.
a In addition to defined benefit pension schemes, IAS 19 requires the Group to account for other post-retirement benefits that are a accruing.
The financial statements at 1 October 2005 therefore recognise an accrual of 0.3m 2004: 0.3m in relation to posta retirement medical benefits that are accruing for certain employees.
c The implementation of IAS 19 Employee benefits and IFRS 2 Share-based payment has resulted in the recognition of deferred tax a assets of 20.6m 2004: 19.5m in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme and 2.3m 2004: 1.9m in relation to share-based a payments.
The income tax impact of these entries for the period ended 1 October 2005 was a credit of 0.2m for the defined benefit a pension schemes and a charge of 1.8m relating to share-based payments.
a IAS 12 Income taxes requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences between the tax base and the carrying value a of assets and liabilities rather than just on timing differences as under UK GAAP.
Specifically, deferred tax is now recognised on the a rolled over gains on property disposals and asset revaluations.
As at 1 October 2005 a deferred tax liability of 89.9m 2004: 91.4m a was recognised in respect of property, resulting in a reduction in the revaluation reserve of 68.7m 2004: 69.2m.
A further 18.1m a 2004: nil deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of subsidiary companies acquired during the period.
The impact of this on a the income statement for the period to 1 October 2005 was a credit to ordinary activities of 1.3m and an exceptional charge of 0.3m.
d Under IFRS profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are deemed to be operating income expenses.
e Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 the Group has elected to carry properties in the financial statements at open market value.
a The Groups properties were therefore valued at the transition date of 2 October 2004 and the carrying value subsequently uplifted by a 53.7m, resulting in a credit to the revaluation reserve of 54.9m.
The charge to the income statement of 0.4m in the period to 1 a October 2005 relates to an impairment of carrying value.
f Under UK GAAP goodwill is amortised over its expected useful life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
Under IFRS goodwill is a not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment test.
Therefore, goodwill amortisation of 7.0m charged in the period to 1 a October 2005 in relation to subsidiaries held at the beginning of the period has been reversed, together with a further 0.1m in relation a to subsidiaries acquired during the period.
Goodwill amortisation charged prior to 2 October 2004 has not been reversed.

IFRS requires the fair value of all equity based transactions at the date of grant to be a charged to the income statement.
The fair value has been determined by applying the Black-Scholes valuation model and is being a charged to the income statement evenly over the vesting period.
The adjustment at 1 October 2005 is a credit of 1.1m to the income a statement 2004: charge of 0.2m.
h In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets, tangible assets of 0.8m and 1.1m at 2 October 2004 and 1 October 2005 respectively a were reclassified as intangible assets.
These represent computer software costs which are being amortised over five years.
a On the acquisition of Jennings in the period ended 1 October 2005, 2.8m of the goodwill arising on acquisition has been reclassified a as an intangible asset, representing the fair value of the acquired brand name.
There was no impact on the income statement.
i IAS 17 deems lease premiums paid on the acquisition of leasehold property held under operating lease to be rentals paid in advance, a and categorises such balances as other non-current assets.
Under UK GAAP such premiums were included within the cost of fixed a assets.
The impact is to reclassify 0.6m and 1.0m at 2 October 2004 and 1 October 2005 respectively from property, plant and a equipment to other non-current assets.
j Dividends relating to an accounting period are dealt with in that period under UK GAAP.
IFRS does not permit recognition of a dividend a until it is approved, typically after the accounting period to which it relates.
The effect of this change is to increase equity by 16.9m at a 2 October 2004 and 19.8m at 1 October 2005. k IAS 32 requires preference shares to be classified as debt, whereas these were previously treated as share capital under UK GAAP.
