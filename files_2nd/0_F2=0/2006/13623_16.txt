These calculations use cash flow projections and are based on actual operating results and the latest Group three-year plan.
The three-year plan is based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
Cash flows for the remainder of the next twenty years are extrapolated using a two per cent growth rate which reflects the long-term nature of many of the markets the Group serves.
This rate has been consistently bettered in the past so is believed to represent a prudent estimate.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10%, being the Groups weighted average cost of capital, has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
On this basis no impairment write downs are required.

Estimation of fair values Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date, and gains and losses taken to equity.
No contracts value date is greater than one year from the year end.
Secured loans As the loans have a flexible repayment schedule, and may be paid down in less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Trade and other receivables payables As the receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
