Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 91 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32 Transition to IFRS continued To explain the change to IFRS, a reconciliation has been provided of the equity at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 and the net income for the year to 31 March 2005 from the previously published consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK GAAP to the accompanying consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
An explanation of the principal adjustments required by Burberry Group on conversion to IFRS are set out below.
This information had been extracted from the Burberry Group plc financial results under IFRS as published by the Burberry Group on 10 June 2005, which is available on the Groups website www.
Since June 2005, IFRS have been subject to ongoing review and further clarification.

The impact on profit before taxation as a result of these amendments is 0.7m.
There have been no material adjustments to the cash flow statement.
Attributable profit reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS: Year to 31 March 2005 m Attributable profit under UK GAAP 109.9 Share based payments 5.1 Goodwill no longer amortised 6.8 Deferred tax remeasurement 0.3 Attributable profit under IFRS 111.9 Equity reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2005 2004 m m Shareholders equity under UK GAAP 454.6 429.4 Share based payments 0.7 0.7 Goodwill no longer amortised 6.8 Deferred tax remeasurement 11.4 12.6 Dividends 21.7 14.9 Other 0.1 0.2 Shareholders equity under IFRS 472.3 432.2 The significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS which affect the Group are as follows: a Share based payments Under UK GAAP, the cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised in the year of performance to which the scheme related.
The charge was recognised based on the fair market value of the share award at the date of grant, less any consideration receivable from the participating Burberry employee.
Under IFRS equity-settled transaction charges are recognised from the date of grant over the vesting period of the shares.
The total charge is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant.
The fair value at the date of grant has been determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Where awards are contingent upon future events an assessment of the likelihood of these conditions being achieved is made at the time of the award.
b Goodwill no longer amortised Under UK GAAP, goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Under IFRS, goodwill has been assigned an indefinite life as at the date of transition and it is no longer amortised.
Burberry has elected to apply the exemption related to Business Combinations and has frozen its goodwill at its carrying value as at 1 April 2004.
All accumulated amortisation at this point in time has been reclassified against the cost of the goodwill.
Impairment reviews will be carried out on goodwill on an annual basis and any impairment charge would be charged and if applicable reported as a material item.
92 Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32 Transition to IFRS continued c Deferred taxation remeasurement Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was recognised for all timing differences, being the difference between an entitys taxable profits and its statutory results, which are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax under IAS 12 Income Taxes is recognised on all taxable temporary differences and all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, to the extent that there are sufficient taxable profits available in future periods.
Temporary differences are the difference between the tax base of an asset liability and its carrying amount in the financial statements.
The most significant difference between IFRS and UK GAAP is that deferred tax is now recognised on the revaluation of fixed assets.
d Dividends Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends are recorded as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, dividends proposed at the balance sheet date are only recorded as a liability when the shareholders have approved their distribution or for the interim dividend when it has been paid.
The recognition of the charge in the income statement in relation to dividends does not affect the timing of the payment of dividends or Burberrys dividend policy.
