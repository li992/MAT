Notes to the Group Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
A Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations collectively IFRSs endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
B New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: Effective date IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating segments 1 January 2009 IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial 1 March 2006 Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2, Share-based payment 1 May 2006 IFRIC 9 Re-assessment of embedded derivatives 1 June 2006 IFRIC 10 Interim financial information and impairment 1 November 2006 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements 1 January 2008 Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will need to expand the disclosures in relation to the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the Groups profit or net assets.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will need to expand the disclosure in relation to segmental analysis.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
C Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Aggreko plc and all its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding that confers more than half of the voting rights.
The consolidated income statement included the results of business purchased from the effective date of acquisition.
D Revenue recognition Revenue for the Group represents the amounts earned from the supply of temporary power, temperature control, oil-free compressed air and related services and excludes sales taxes and intra-group revenue.
Revenue is recognised during the rental period in which the equipment and related services are utilised by the customer.
E Segmental reporting Aggrekos primary reporting format relates to geographical segments comprising Northern Europe, Continental Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia-Pacic and South America together the Groups Local business and a global segment of International Power Projects IPP.
IPP is managed as a single segment, with the deployment of assets varying from year to year depending on the location of projects.
The geographical risks and rewards within IPP are signicantly different from those within the Groups Local business.
72 Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Aggrekos secondary reporting format relates to the Groups two business types detailed above, namely the Local business and International Power Projects business.
The Local business focuses on smaller, more frequently occurring events, whereas the International Power Projects business concentrates on large contracts, which can arise anywhere in the world.
The risks and rewards of the Groups operations are determined by the different geographical locations.
This is reected by the Groups divisional management and organisational structure and the Groups internal financial reporting systems.
The segmented analysis in Note 4 to the Accounts is based on location of assets.
Central administrative costs are allocated between segments based on revenue.
F Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classied as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
G Exceptional items Items are classied as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Group to be material and are different from events or transactions which fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually, or if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to be properly understood.
Details of the exceptional items are provided in Note 7 to the financial statements.
H Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of each lease.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The periods of depreciation are reviewed on an annual basis and the principal periods used are as follows: Rental eet 8 to 10 years Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years I Capital Grants Capital grants in respect of additions to property, plant and equipment are netted against the cost of the related asset and this cost is depreciated in accordance with the policy in note 1H.
J Intangibles Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition of each asset over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships: 10 years: Non-compete agreements: over the life of the non-compete agreements.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is currently deemed to be 4 years.
The useful life of intangible assets is reviewed on an annual basis.
K Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment reviews, both annually and when there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 73 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2006 1 Accounting policies continued For the purpose of the impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
L Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets excluding goodwill Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are amortised depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
M Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates functional currency.
The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
At individual company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Income and cash ow statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Gains and losses from the settlement of transactions and gains and losses on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in the income statement.
N Derivative financial instruments The Group accounts for financial instruments under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IAS 39 requires the fair value of all derivative financial instruments to be recognised on the balance sheet.
The activities of the Group expose it directly to the financial risks of changes in forward foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recorded and subsequently measured at fair value, which is calculated using standard industry valuation techniques in conjunction with observable market data.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows using market interest rates and the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The treatment of changes in fair value of derivatives depends on the derivative classication.
The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions or commitments cash ow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
74 Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 Cash ow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated, and effective, as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit and loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Overseas net investment hedges Certain foreign currency borrowings are designated as hedges of the Groups overseas net investments, which are denominated in the functional currency of the reporting operation.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings are taken to equity on consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
All other exchange gains and losses are dealt with through the income statement.
O Taxation Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, negative goodwill nor from the acquisition of an asset, which does not affect either taxable or accounting income.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current intention to remit such earnings.
Current Tax The charge for the current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
P Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the FIFO or weighted average cost basis.
Cost includes the cost of direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory is written down on a case by case basis if the anticipated net realisable value declines below the carrying amount of the inventories.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
When the reasons for a write-down of the inventory have ceased to exist, the write-down is reversed.
Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 75 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2006 Q Employee benets Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benets are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee benets, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a dened benefit pension scheme and a number of dened contribution pensions schemes.
The cost for the year for the dened benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit method, with actuarial updates to the valuation being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which they occur and are shown in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The current service cost of the pension charge as well as the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are included in arriving at operating profit.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds.
Contributions to dened contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they become chargeable.
R Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
S Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
T Provisions Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outow of resources that can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account the time value of money where material.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inow of economic benets is probable.
U Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Groups various employee-share and option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for employee sharesave options and using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model for Executive share options.
Own shares held under trust for the Groups employee share schemes are classed as Treasury shares and deducted in arriving at shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on disposal of Treasury shares.
Purchases of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
V Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
This denition is also used for the cashow statement.
76 Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 W Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.
X Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Y Key assumptions and significant judgements The Group use estimates and make judgements in the preparation of its Accounts.
The most sensitive areas affecting the Accounts are discussed below.
Pensions Pension arrangements vary for our employees and schemes reect best practice and regulation in each country.
The Group operates a dened benefit scheme for UK employees, which was closed to new employees joining the group after 1 April 2002, as well as a number of dened contribution schemes.
Under IAS 19: Employee Benets Aggreko has recognised a pre tax pension deficit of 13.1 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 16.8 million.
The decrease in the pension deficit is mainly as a result of additional contributions made by the Company during the year.
Following the completion of the actuarial valuation at 31 December 2005, the Company and trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
During 2006 the Company contributions for benets building up in the future were increased to 31.5% of pensionable earnings and from 1 January 2007 the Company contributions will be 25.4%.
From 1 January 2007 future benets will be accrued on a Career Average basis hence the change to the required contribution rate.
To address the Scheme deficit the Company made an additional contribution of 3.5 million in 2006 and plans to make additional contributions of 4.0 million in 2007, 4.0 million in 2008 and 0.5 million per annum until December 2015.
Employee contributions will increase to 6% from 1 January 2007.
The main assumptions used in IAS 19 valuation for the previous two years are shown in note 28 of the Accounts.
Taxation The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
Estimation of the tax charge requires an assessment to be made of the potential tax treatment of certain items which will only be resolved once nally agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
Property, plant and equipment The property, plant and equipment used in the business is mainly the rental eet which has a depreciation life typically of between 8 and 10 years.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives allocated to each type of asset.
Assets lives are reviewed regularly and changed when necessary to reect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Intangible assets In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 also requires the identication of other acquired intangible assets.
The techniques used to value these intangible assets are in line with recognised models but do require the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation period adopted for these items and, potentially, any differences between estimated and actual circumstances related to individual intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The impairment review calculations require the use of estimates related to the future profitability and cash generating ability of the acquired assets.
Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 77 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2006 Z Financial risk management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk.
The Group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise, and that financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identied and managed.
The treasury operations are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and are reviewed annually.
Financial instruments are only executed for hedging purposes and transactions that are speculative in nature are expressly forbidden.
Monthly reports are provided to senior management and treasury operations are subject to periodic internal and external review.
Liquidity and funding The Group maintains sufficient facilities to meet its normal funding requirements over the medium term.
These facilities are primarily in the form of bank facilities arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of international banks.
The financial covenants attached to these facilities are that operating profit should be no less than 3x interest, and net debt should be no more than 3x EBITDA.
The Group does not consider that the financial covenants contained in the facilities are restrictive to its operations.
The Groups borrowings were 218.2 million at 31 December 2006, and net debt amounted to 205.2 million.
At that date undrawn committed facilities were 152.9 million.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the exposure to interest rates by ensuring an appropriate balance of xed and oating rates.
The Groups primary funding is at oating rates through its bank facilities.
In order to manage the associated interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary the mix of xed and oating rates.
At 31 December 2006 121.0 million of the net debt of 205.2 million was at xed rates of interest resulting in a xed to oating rate net debt ratio of 59:41.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation of its net investments in overseas subsidiaries into sterling.
In order to reduce the currency risk arising, the Group uses direct borrowings in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are currently drawn down in the principal currencies affecting the Group, namely US dollar and euro, as well as sterling.
The Group manages its currency ows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate in order to hedge net currency ows.
Counterparty and credit risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties.
The Group manages this risk by limiting the aggregate amounts and their duration depending on external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
In the case of financial assets exposed to credit risk, the carrying amount in the balance sheet, net of any applicable provisions for loss, represents the amount exposed to credit risk.
Management of trade debtors The management of trade debtors is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
Many of the International Power Projects contracts require sophisticated risk management, and the Group deploys a number of tools to manage its risk, including advanced payments, letters of credit, bank guarantees, bonds, credit and political risk insurance.
On large contracts, all such arrangements are approved at Group level.
Insurance The Group operates a policy of buying cover where possible for material risks from the global insurance market, whilst self-insuring risks which would not have a material impact on the Group as a whole.
The Group monitors its insurance arrangements in such a way to ensure the quality and extent of cover.

The principal benchmark rates for oating rate financial liabilities are the relevant LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate rates for sterling, US dollars and euros and liabilities are normally xed in advance for periods between one and three months.
The weighted average interest rate on xed debt is derived from the xed leg of each interest rate swap.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 121.0 million 2005: 61.8 million of borrowings in the above table as xed rate.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2006 was 121.0 million 2005: 61.8 million.

The movement in the hedging reserve is shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity Note 25. i Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2006.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
2006 2005 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value million million million million Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Current borrowings and overdrafts 10.3 10.3 9.5 9.5 Non-current borrowings 207.9 207.9 101.7 101.7 Short-term deposits 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 Cash at bank and in hand 12.5 12.5 7.9 7.9 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate prole: Interest rate swaps 0.8 0.8 0.6 0.6 Forward foreign currency contracts 0.9 0.9 0.6 0.6 ii Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts Fair value is based on market price of these instruments at the balance sheet date.
Current borrowings and overdrafts Short-term deposits The fair value of short-term deposits and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are oating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

These will be allotted to the cost of the asset as a basis adjustment when the forecast capital expenditure occurs.
The net fair value gains at 31 December 2006 on open interest swaps that hedge interest risk are 0.8 million 2005: 0.6 million.
These will be credited to the income statement over the remaining life of each interest rate swap.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The group has both dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its overseas subsidiaries.
The fair value of the dollar borrowings at 31 December 2006 was 154.7 million 2005: 68.3 million and the euro borrowings 29.5 million 2005: 24.3 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 8.4 million 2005: loss of 6.3 million on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.

As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences of nil in both years relate to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries which pay tax at rates less than the UK rate of tax.
If the earnings were remitted no tax would be payable 2005: nil, due to the availability of foreign tax credits for offset.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to off setting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 2.1 million 2005: 1.2 million of which 1.5 million 2005: 1.2 million relates to carried forward tax losses and 0.6 million 2005: nil relates to other temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets of 0.1 million 2005: 0.2 million have been recognised in respect of entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period as our forecasts indicate that these assets will reverse in the near future.

The options under the US Stock Purchase Plan have been granted at a discount of 15% of the share price on the date of grant, mature after two years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the Executive Share Option Scheme are normally only exercisable once three years have elapsed from date of grant and lapse after ten years.
All Executive Options are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
There is no legal obligation upon the Company to satisfy the options existing under the Savings-Related and Executive Share Option Schemes other than by the allotment of new issue shares.

The charge against profit is the amount of contributions payable to the pension scheme in respect of the accounting period.
The pension cost attributable to overseas employees for 2006 was 2.1 million 2005: 1.8 million.
United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, dened benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of individual trustees.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries have adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets have been taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 4.6% Growth in average pay levels 4.3% Increase in pensions 2.8% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 18,400,000 which was sufficient to cover 53% of the benets that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
Following completion of the valuation at 31 December 2005, the Company and the trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
During 2006 the Company contributions for benets building up in the future were increased to 31.5% of pensionable earnings and from 1 January 2007 the company contribution will be 25.4% of pensionable earnings.
From 1 January 2007 future benets will be accrued, on a Career Average basis hence the change to the required contribution rate.
To address the Scheme deficit the Company made an additional contribution of 3.5 million in 2006 and the Company plans to make further additional contributions of 4.0 million in 2007, 4.0 million in 2008 and 0.5 million per annum until the year ended 31 December 2015.
Employee contributions will increase to 6% of pensionable earnings from 1 January 2007.
The Scheme was closed to all new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
The service cost, as a percentage of pensionable salaries, will increase in the future as members near retirement.
For new employees joining after 1 April 2002, a dened contribution scheme has been introduced.
Contributions of 0.2 million were paid to this scheme during the year 2005: 0.2 million.
There are no outstanding or prepaid balances at the year end.
An update of the Scheme was carried out by a qualied independent actuary using the latest available information for the purposes of this statement.
The major assumptions used in this update by the actuary were: 31 Dec 2006 31 Dec 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% 4.3% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1% 2.8% Discount rate 5.0% 4.6% Ination assumption 3.1% 2.8% Expected return on Scheme assets 6.1% 5.6% Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years Men 21.3 21.3 Women 24.2 24.2 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years Men 23.1 23.1 Women 25.9 25.9 The expected return on Scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.

The amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the Scheme are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 million million million Fair value of assets 24.3 18.4 12.9 Present value of funded obligations 37.4 35.2 23.1 Liability recognised in the Balance Sheet 13.1 16.8 10.2 An alternative method of valuation is the estimated cost of buying out benets at 31 December 2006 with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at 31 December 2006 rather than the Company continuing to fund the on-going liabilities of the Scheme.
The company estimates the amount required to settle the Schemes liabilities at 31 December 2006 is 60.0 million which gives a Scheme shortfall on a buyout basis of approximately 35.7 million.

100 Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 30 Acquisition of GE Energy Rentals On 4 December 2006 the Group acquired the entire share capital of GE Energy Rentals Inc and the entire share capital of GE Energy do Brasil Ltda.
as well as substantially all the other trade and assets of the Energy Rentals business of GE excluding those relating to gas turbines.
The maximum consideration payable is 112.0 million and the fair value of net assets acquired is 65.3 million resulting in goodwill of 46.7 million.
The initial purchase consideration for this acquisition including 4.4 million of transaction fees was 97.1 million with a further payment of up to 14.9 million dependent on the delivery by GE of additional eet assets during 2007.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted and the goodwill arising on the purchase has been capitalised.
The details of the transaction and fair value adjustments arising from the change in ownership are shown below.

These include estimated values for inventory in a number of locations as well as repairs required to eet assets which have still to be nally assessed.
These values could not be nalised given the proximity of the transaction to the year end.
Goodwill represents the value of synergies arising from the global integration of the acquired business and the acquirees assembled workforce.
Synergies include overhead reductions mainly property and people and improved utilisation of the acquired eet assets.
The GE Energy Rentals business was fully integrated into the Aggreko business on acquisition therefore it is not possible to separately disclose post acquisition revenue or profit loss for this acquisition.
It is also impracticable to disclose pre-acquisition revenue and profit loss for the period as reliable and accurate information is not available for 2006.
