ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates Introduction The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates presented in this report are prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc Policy for the Reporting of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
This policy requires that the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition the JORC Code be used as a minimum standard.
Some AA plc subsidiaries have a primary listing in South Africa where public reporting is carried out according to the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 2000 edition the SAMREC Code.
The SAMREC Code is similar to the JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology appearing in this section follows the fide nitions in both the JORC 2004 and SAMREC 2000 Codes.
The information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources was prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as fide ned in the JORC or SAMREC Codes.
All Competent Persons have suf cient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking.
All the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears.
The names of the Competent Persons are lodged with the Anglo American plc company secretaries in London and are available on request.
Anglo American Group Companies are subject to a comprehensive programme of audits aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates.
The audits are conducted by suitably quali ed Competent Persons from within a particular division, another division of the Company or from independent consultants.
The frequency and depth of the audits is a function of the risks and or uncertainties associated with a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource, the overall value thereof and time that has lapsed since an independent third party audit has been conducted.
Those operations projects subject to independent, third party audits during the year are indicated in footnotes to the tables.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions.
These include long-range commodity price forecasts which are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and long term economic outlooks.
Ore Reserve estimates are dynamic and are in uenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and relevant new information and therefore can vary from year to year.
Mineral Resource estimates also change and tend to be in uenced mostly by new information pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and secondly by the conversion to Ore Reserves.
The estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are as at 31 December 2006.
Unless otherwise stated, Mineral Resources are additional to those resources which have been modi ed to produce the Ore Reserves.
The gures in the tables have been rounded and, if used to derive totals and averages, could cause minor computational differences.
Ore Reserves in the context of this report have the same meaning as Mineral Reserves as fide ned by the SAMREC Code.
Metric units are used throughout the report.
In addition alternative units are also used for Anglo Platinum and AngloGold Ashanti.
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earths crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from speci c geological evidence and knowledge.
Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological con dence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of con dence.
It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not veri ed geological and or grade continuity.
It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability.
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of con dence.
It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to con rm geological and or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.
A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of con dence.
It is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
The locations are spaced closely enough to con rm geological and grade continuity.
An Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and or Indicated Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modi cation by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justi ed.
Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing con dence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves.
A Probable Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modi cation by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justi ed.
A Proved Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource.
128 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 In South Africa, the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act, Number 28 of 2002 MPRDA was implemented on 1 May 2004, and effectively transferred custodianship of the previously privately held mineral rights to the State.
Mining companies were given up to two years to apply for prospecting permit conversions and five years to apply for mining licence conversions for existing operations.
A Prospecting Right is a new order right that is valid for up to five years, with the possibility of a further extension of three years, that can be obtained either by the conversion of existing old order prospecting permits or through new applications.
An Exploration Right is identical to a Prospecting Right, but is commodity speci c in respect of petroleum and gas and is valid for up to three years which can be renewed for a maximum of 3 periods not exceeding two years each.
A Mining Right is a new order right valid for up to 30 years obtained either by the conversion of an old order mining licence, or as a new order right pursuant to the exercise of the exclusive right of the holder of a new order Prospecting Right, or pursuant to an application for a new Mining Right.
A Production Right is identical to a Mining Right, but is commodity speci c in respect of petroleum and gas.
In preparing the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statement for South African assets, Anglo American plc has adopted the following reporting principles in respect of Prospecting Rights and Mining Rights: Where applications for new order Mining Rights and Prospecting Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory authorities, the relevant reserves and resources have been included in the statement: Where applications for the conversion of old order mining licenses to new order Mining Rights have not yet been submitted and the required deadline typically April 2009 for submission has not passed, the relevant reserves and resources have been included in the statement: Where applications for new order Prospecting Rights have been initially refused by the regulatory authorities, but are the subject of ongoing legal process and discussions with the relevant authorities and where Anglo American plc has reasonable expectations that the Prospecting Rights will be granted in due course, the relevant resources have been included in the statement any associated comments appear in the footnotes.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 129 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates continued stated as at 31 December 2006 Platinum The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
Where relevant, the estimates were also prepared in compliance with regional codes and requirements e. g. The South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2000.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.
The Mineral Resources are additional to the Ore Reserves.
Mineral Resources are reported over an economic and mineable resource cut appropriate to speci c ore deposits which form the basis of the consolidated reef gures.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Anglo American plcs interest in Anglo Platinum is 75.37%.
1 Tonnage: quoted as metric tonnes.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 Alternative units: tonnage in million short tons Mton and grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t. 4 Merensky Reef: The 2006 exploration programme at Amandelbult Section lead to an increase in the estimate of the geological losses and a decrease in the stope width which accounts for the decrease in Probable Ore Reserves.
5 UG2 Reef: Increases are mainly due to the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves at Twickenham Platinum Mine Project pre-feasibility study completed and additional drilling at both Amandelbult Section and Lebowa Platinum Mine.
6 Platreef: Geo-technical constraints imposed in 2005 at PPRust North were reviewed and revised by an independent consultant.
As a result the pit was re-designed, accounting for the increase in the Ore Reserves and a subsequent decrease in Measured Mineral Resources.
7 Platreef stockpiles: These are reported separately as Proved Ore Reserves and aggregated into the summation tabulations.
8 Tailings: These are reported separately as Ore Reserves but are not aggregated in the total Ore Reserve gures.
The following operations projects were reviewed during 2006 by an external third party consulting rm: Ga-Phasha PGM Project, Der Brochen Project, Booysendal Project, BRPM JV Styldrift.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 Alternative units: tonnage in million short tons Mton and grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t. 4 Merensky Reef: Measured Resource tonnes increase as a result of additional drilling and higher geo-scienti c con dence in the estimates at BRPM JV Styldrift and Modikwa JV.
5 UG2 Reef: The increase in the UG2 Measured Resource is mainly due to increased con dence in the estimates obtained through an extensive drilling programme and updated resource evaluation modelling at Rustenburg Section, Amandelbult Section, Lebowa Platinum Mine, BRPM JV and Modikwa JV.
6 Platreef: Measured Mineral Resources decrease is due to conversion to Ore Reserves at PPRust North new pit design.
Additional drilling information at Zwartfontein North identi ed structural complexities resulting in a reallocation to Indicated Resources.
These decreases are offset by an increased planned pit-depth at Zwartfontein South.
7 Tailings: These are reported separately as Mineral Resources but are not aggregated in the total Mineral Resource gures.
Where applications for new order Prospecting Rights have been initially refused by the relevant authorities and are still the subject of ongoing judicial review and Anglo Platinum has a reasonable expectation that the Prospecting Rights will be granted in due course, the relevant resources have been included in the statement.
Approximately 66Moz of Mineral Resources are affected.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 Alternative units: tonnage in million short tons Mton and grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t. 4 Anooraq-Anglo Platinum JV: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
A cut-off of US$20 gross metal value per tonne was applied.
5 Shebas Ridge: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 35%.
A cut-off of US$10.5 per tonne total revenue contribution from the constituent metals was applied.
6 River Valley: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
A cut-off of 0.7 g t platinum palladium was applied.
7 Pedra Branca: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable right of 51%.

138 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 Material changes to Run of Mine ROM Coal Reserves from 2005 to 2006 excluding depletion by mining : Export Thermal Australia: The decrease is due mainly to the closure of Dartbrook and the re-allocation of Coal Reserves to Coal Resources 55 Mt.
Export Thermal Colombia: The decrease is mainly due to a reduction in recovery extraction factors applied to the life of mine plan at Cerrejon 25 Mt.
Domestic Power Generation South Africa: The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in New Denmark extraction factors 27 Mt and the transfer of Mafube reserves from Domestic Power Generation to Export Thermal 23 Mt.
Material changes to Coal Resources Mine Leases from 2005 to 2006: Export Metallurgical Australia: The decrease is attributed mainly to the exclusion of Inferred Resources in the mine plan due to change in mining layout at Dawson North 40 Mt.
Export Thermal Australia: The decrease is mainly due to the closure of Dartbrook and the transfer to Projects 69 Mt.
Export Thermal Colombia: The increase is as a result of the inclusion of Cerrejn Sur resources 50 Mt.
Export Thermal South Africa: The decrease is brought about by the rationalisation of resources in the Elders Block 52 Mt, the conversion of Coal Resources to Coal Reserves at Goedehoop 25 Mt and at Greenside 42 Mt, the exclusion of resources as a result of a change in economic assumptions at Kleinkopje 64 Mt and at Landau 22 Mt.
This is offset by the transfer of resources at Mafube from Domestic Power Generation to Export Thermal 29 Mt.
Export Thermal Venezuela: The decrease is as a result of resource block re nement following exploration drilling at Guasare 5 Mt.
Material changes to Coal Resources Projects from 2005 to 2006: Australia: The increase is due mainly to the inclusion of resources at Theodor South 262 Mt and Dartbrook 222 Mt.
China: The increase is the result of the JV with the Shanxi Geological Bureau and initial assessment of the Xiwan resources 499 Mt.
South Africa: The decrease is attributed to: Elders: Change in cut-off parameters and resource sterilisation by wetland 80 Mt : Mafube: Transfer to Export Thermal with the approval of the Mafube Project 51 Mt : Vaalbank: Re-allocation from Indicated Coal Resources to Inferred Coal Resources due to re-evaluation of the coal quality model in line with Anglo Coal standards 744 Mt : South Rand: Inclusion of resources 18 Mt.
Material changes to Brown Coal Resources from 2005 to 2006: Australia: The increase is due to the initial evaluation of the Brown Coal Resources at Monash Energy 6,476 Mt.
Material changes to Gas Reserves from 2005 to 2006: 3 Australia: The increase in Coal Bed Methane Gas Reserves is due to the acquisition of the Origin gas properties.
3,509 million m. Impact of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act MPRDA on the reporting of Coal Resources and Coal Reserves in South Africa As at 31 December 2006, a total of 40.1 million tonnes of the reported Coal Resources in Projects were associated with two applications for new order Prospecting Rights that have been initially refused and are now the subject of ongoing legal process and discussions with the relevant authorities.
Anglo Coal currently expects that the outcome of such review and discussions will be favourable and accordingly the relevant resources have been included in the statement.
Audits Audits were carried out in 2006 on the following operations and project areas: South Africa: Isibonelo, Maccauvlei East, Elders, Vaalbank.
Australia: Callide Coal elds Boundary Hill Ext.

Small volumes of ore from Barro Alto are currently being processed at the Codemin plant.
3 Gamsberg: Based on a feasibility study completed in 2000 and reviewed in 2006 to account for current economic and financial assumptions.
The Mine Plan includes an additional 54,200 kt at 4.10 %Zn of Inferred Mineral Resources.
4 Barro Alto: Resource gain based on new drilling information and inclusion of Inferred in Mine Plan, which was not reported in 2005.
146 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 Ferrous Metals and Industries The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with The South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2000.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc via Kumba Iron Ore is stated separately.
Mineral Resource estimates for Kumba are inclusive of those resources which have been modi ed to produce the Ore Reserve estimates.
1 Sishen Iron Ore Mine DMS and jig plant: The increase in Proved Ore Reserve tonnes is the result of a new optimising programme that allowed for the blending of previously stockpiled material.
The decrease in saleable product tonnes is mainly due to the reduction of ROM Reserves as a result of geological re-interpretation as well as a slight drop in plant yield brought about by the exclusion of selective mining tonnes due to changes in mine planning criteria.
17Mt Inferred Mineral Resource tonnes fall within the final pit layout: these are not included in the Ore Reserve gure.
2 Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine within current pit layouts: Mining depletion accounts for most of the decrease along with an updated geological model, and as a result of an external review of the drill hole spacing, a portion of the reserve has been re-allocated to Inferred Resources.
4Mt Inferred Mineral Resource tonnes fall within the final pit layout: these are not included in the Ore Reserve gure.
3 Sishen Iron Ore Mine Open Pit DMS and jig plant : Resources decrease mainly as a result of a re-interpretation of the solids model, mining depletion and stockpile growth.
4 S ishen Iron Ore Mine Underground: Resources increase due to conglomeratic ore now being included.
5 Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine Open Pit: The major decrease in the resources is due to mining depletion and the re-allocation of Indicated Resources to Inferred Resources.
6 Sish en South: Advanced Project Additional exploration drilling, an updated mineral resource model and pit design account for the increased tonnage.
The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of the following operation was audited during 2006 by third party, independent auditors: Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 147 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates continued stated as at 31 December 2006 Ferrous Metals and Industries continued The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The Manganese Mineral Resources are reported as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modi ed to produce the Ore Reserve gures, i. e. the Ore Reserves are included in the Mineral Resource gures.
Mamatwan tonnages stated as Wet Metric Tonnes.
Wessels tonnages stated as Dry Metric Tonnes.
1 Hotazel Managanese Mines: The changes are due to a new improved 3D resource model which was constructed during 2006 and a change in the classi cation criteria.
2 GEMCO: The Ore Reserves reported are stated with total tonnage but report the grade values only above the nominated cut-off of 40% Mn product grade.
The grade is reported using bene ciated grades, as bene ciated grades are used: in mine scheduling, quality control and blending rather than in situ grades.
Changes are due to depletion and a signi cant drop in price assumptions.
3 Hotazel Manganese Mines: The changes are due to a new improved 3D resource model which was constructed during 2006 and a change in the classi cation criteria.
4 GEM CO: The primary cause of change in the resource estimate was depletion.
A second effect was a more detailed methodology in which the plan areas for resource determination were generated, explicitly excluding mined out and off lease areas.
5 Highveld: The Ore Reserve grades and tonnages are reported after crushing, washing and screening.
