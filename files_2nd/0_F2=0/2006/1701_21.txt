Shareholders 126 Shareholder information Electronic communications Each year the company distributes to shareholders various documents and reports to meet the obligations of the Companies Act 1985 and the UK Listing Rules.
These are currently posted to shareholders.
The company wishes to take advantage of changes in legislation and send those papers, and any other communications, electronically where shareholders agree.
To enable the company to send documents to shareholders electronically, they need to register at the following website, www.
Once registered with Shareview, shareholders gain more control of their shares and other investments as they can view details of recent movements in their shareholding and change their address and bank mandate details online.
The company believes that electronic communications will improve services to shareholders and reduce costs for the company.
BACS If shareholders wish to have their cash dividends paid directly into their bank or building society account, a BACS instruction form can be requested from Lloyds TSB Registrars or found attached to dividend cheques.
Shareholders are encouraged to use this facility as it makes receiving dividend payments more secure and faster as well as being cheaper for the company.
Cash dividends An interim dividend payment of 14.8 pence per share was paid on 13 January 2006 to all ordinary shareholders on the register at 5pm on 9 December 2005.
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 36 pence per share.
The company has now introduced consolidated tax vouchers.
This means that if you have your dividend paid directly into your bank or building society account you will now only receive one tax voucher a year with the interim dividend and not the final dividend.
Capital payments to shareholders In February 2005, AWG returned to paying a cash dividend, prior to that the company made capital payments to ordinary shareholders in the form of redeemable shares.
Please see below details of redeemable share issues and returns of capital, for capital gains tax calculation purposes.
For capital gains tax calculations the base cost of the redeemable shares will be taken as a proportion of the shareholders original base cost in their existing ordinary shares.
The apportionment percentages are calculated by reference to market values at the date of issue of redeemable shares: Apportionment percentages Date and event O S R S Special R S C Shares of 1.77 each 23 October 2000 issue of 310 R S per O S 95.25 4.75 12 February 2001 issue of 132 R S per O S 97.80 2.20 30 July 2001 issue of 308 R S per O S 94.85 5.15 11 February 2002 issue of 134.2 R S per O S 97.63 2.37 23 September 2002 issue of 312 R S per O S 93.82 6.18 16 October 2002 return of capital 55.49 44.51 6 January 2003 issue of 136 R S per O S 96.98 3.02 16 June 2003 return of cash 77.38 5.54 17.08 15 December 2003 issue of 140 R S per O S 97.74 2.26 21 June 2004 issue of 332 R S per O S 95.40 4.60 R S Redeemable shares O S Ordinary shares Consequent to the capital reorganisations the only ordinary share certicates that are valid are those dated 13 June 2003 or later.
