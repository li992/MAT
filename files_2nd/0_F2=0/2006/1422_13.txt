Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 16 September 2006 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 301m 2005 379m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 790 million 2005 789 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Option Scheme on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses, provision for loss on temination of an operation, intangible amortisation, exceptional items and the associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 790 million 2005 789 million.
There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Intangible assets continued Impairment Goodwill As at 16 September 2006, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 1,013m.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows: 2006 2005 Cash-generating unit CGU or group of CGUs Primary reporting segment m m ACH Grocery 208 216 AB Mauri Ingredients 232 232 Twinings Ovaltine Grocery 122 122 Capullo Grocery 58 58 Illovo Primary Food 148 Other Various 245 216 1,013 844 The amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs is not individually significant.
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
There have been no indications of impairment relating to the CGUs or groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated and, accordingly, the disclosures that follow relate to the impairment test that is required to be conducted on an annual basis: The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs based on the most recent budget.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budget are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The rates used vary between 8% and 11%.
The growth rates applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that is significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill were in a range between 0% and 2.5%.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.

Property, plant & equipment continued Impairment UK sugar operations The reform of the EU sugar regime has impacted adversely on the performance of the groups European sugar operations and is expected to have further adverse consequences in the future.
Management has considered the impact of the reform of the EU sugar regime on the groups operations and on 4 July 2006 announced its intention to close two UK factories following the 2006 7 campaign.
As a result, the carrying value and useful lives of the factories to be closed have been assessed for impairment.
The carrying value of each of the two factories to be closed has been assessed separately for impairment on the basis of their value in use.
The cash flow projections used for this purpose are based on the most recent budget resulting in an impairment charge of 64m being recognised in the income statement.
The impairment has been recognised as a depreciation charge, recorded in operating costs in the income statement, and is included within the Primary Food segment.

Employee entitlements The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type.
The groups principal UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements in place for these members.
The pension costs in the UK for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
For defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, and are reflected in the balance sheet at 16 September 2006.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested.
The last actuarial valuations of the British Sugar Pension Scheme and the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme were carried out as at 1 October 2004 and 5 April 2005 respectively.
At the valuation dates the total market value of the assets of these schemes was 1,869m and represented 97% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
On 6 April 2006, the British Sugar Pension Scheme was merged into the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme.
Their respective funding positions were recalculated at that point and the group agreed to make two payments of 14.5m, the first in October 2006 and the second in October 2007, to eliminate the deficit at 6 April 2006 in the British Sugar section of the newly-merged scheme.
The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, France and the Philippines.
With the acquisition of Illovo Sugar Limited on 4 September 2006 the group also now operates defined benefit schemes in South Africa and Zambia, both of which are closed to new members.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries.
Assumptions The financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under IAS 19 together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets are: 2006 2005 2004 %%% Discount rate 5.10 5.00 5.60 Inflation 3.00 2.80 2.80 Rate of increase in salaries 4.50 4.50 4.80 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.80 2.50 2.80 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 3.00 2.80 2.80 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 generational mortality tables with medium cohort improvements, as published by the Institute of Actuaries.
The mortality rates underlying these tables have been adjusted to take account of the schemes actual experience.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: Life expectancy from age 65 in years Male Female Member aged 65 in 2006 19.3 22.1 Member aged 65 in 2026 20.3 23.0 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.
For some of the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale On 4 October 2006, with effect from 29 September 2006, the group sold its Scandinavian distribution business, Haugen-Gruppen Haugen, to Icelandic distribution business Innnes.
Haugen, which is part of the Grocery segment, comprised three businesses in Sweden, Denmark and Norway.
The decision to sell was taken because the businesses were not core to group activities, and scale and focus benefits available to another distribution business meant Haugen was more valuable to the buyer than to the group.
As at 16 September 2006 the disposal group comprised assets of 38m less liabilities of 11m.

The group acquired 51% of the shares in the company for 286m, satisfied in cash.
2m of acquisition costs were also incurred in relation to this acquisition.
The subsidiary contributed net profit of nil to the consolidated net profit for the year, since acquisition date.
The contribution to group revenue and net profit, had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the year, has not been disclosed as it would be impracticable to determine these amounts due to the following reasons: i Illovo has a different year end to the group: ii whilst information is publicly available, it is not sufficient to determine accurately the fair value adjustments that would have been made to the balance sheet one year ago: and iii the impact on world sugar markets as a result of the reform in the sugar regime may make disclosing Illovos results for the last 12 months misleading in this context.

Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the Executive Scheme This scheme was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 15 December 2000.
Under the terms of the Executive Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company may be granted to selected employees over the ten years from 15 December 2000.
The exercise of an option under this scheme will, in accordance with institutional shareholder guidelines, be conditional on the achievement of performance criteria which are based on growth in the groups profits.
Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 the Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003.
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which will be released if, and to the extent that, certain performance targets are satisfied over a three year performance period.

The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was 774 pence and the weighted average share price was 834 pence.
The dividend yield used was 2.5%.
No shares were awarded under the Share Incentive Plan in 2005.
No options were granted under the Scheme or the Executive Scheme in either 2005 or 2006.

Risk management policies and hedging activities Foreign currency risk Translation exposure The group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement.
Transaction exposure The main transaction exposures in the group are: sugar prices in British Sugar UK and Poland to movements in the pounds sterling euro and Polish zloty euro exchange rates respectively: sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar exchange rate: and sourcing for Primark which is denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly pounds sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, many other businesses purchase raw materials in foreign currencies largely US dollar denominated.
The groups policy is to hedge trade receivables and trade payables denominated in foreign currencies.
The group also hedges its forecast foreign currency exposure in respect of future sales and purchases up to 12 months.
Significant foreign currency transactions are covered by forward purchases and sales of foreign currency.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts undertaken by the group have maturities of less than one year.
a Forecast transactions The group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecast transactions at 16 September 2006 was a loss of 3m, comprising assets of 2m and liabilities of 5m that were recognised in receivables and trade and other payables respectively.
b Recognised assets and liabilities Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
Both the changes in fair value of the forward contracts and the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items are recognised as part of operating costs.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as economic hedges of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at 16 September 2006 was a loss of 2m comprising assets of 8m and liabilities of 10m that were recognised in receivables and trade and other payables respectively.
c Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The groups US$660m secured bank loan is designated as a hedge of the groups investment in its subsidiary businesses in the United States.
The carrying amount of the loan at 16 September 2006 was 351m 2005 365m.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The groups policy is currently to maintain floating rate debt for a majority of its bank finance.
Commodity price risk The group purchases commodities including wheat, oils, cocoa and tea in the ordinary course of its business.
There are policies in place which are designed to hedge the exposure of the group to changes in the market price of such commodities and these policies include the use of futures and options contracts.
The use of such contracts is tightly controlled within set limits.
The net fair value of futures contracts used as hedges of forecast transactions at 16 September 2006 was a loss of 6m comprising assets of 4m and liabilities of 10m that were recognised in receivables and trade and other payables respectively.
Credit risk Cash and cash equivalents and other current investments The groups cash and cash equivalents and other current investments totalled 409m at 16 September 2006 2005 1,198m including 75m placed with professional investment managers who have full discretion to act within closely monitored and agreed guidelines.
The investment objective is to preserve the underlying assets, whilst achieving a satisfactory return.
The investment guidelines are kept under constant review with the objective of monitoring and controlling risk levels.
The guidelines require that investments must carry a minimum credit rating of AAA1 for longand short-term paper respectively, and also set down conditions relating to sovereign risk, maturity, exchange rate exposure and type of investment instrument.
Aggregate limits for each category of investment and risk exposure are set for each manager.
Other financial assets Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit.
Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations, other than those provided for impaired at 16 September 2006, as described in note 15.
At 16 September 2006 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Liquidity risk The group has a combination of financial investments refer to cash and cash equivalents and other current investments section above and committed bank facilities to ensure that it has available funds to meet its long-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
As at 16 September 2006, the group had US$780m of committed bank facilities.
Since year end the Company has refinanced its external borrowings and has negotiated a multi-currency US$1.2bn syndicated loan facility with a term of five years with two one-year extension options.

Other current investments Fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price in an active market at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date to determine the fair value.
89 Financial statements Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the year ended 16 September 2006 27.
Financial instruments continued Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market-related data at the balance sheet date.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Sensitivity analysis The table below presents the changes in fair value of the groups financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates.
The analysis shows forward-looking projections of market risk based on our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 1% movement in yield curves, an instantaneous 10% movement of pounds sterling against other currencies and an instantaneous 10% movement in commodity prices at balance sheet date.
All other variables are assumed to be constant.
This is a method of analysis used to assess risk and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
Actual results and market conditions in the future may be materially different from those projected and changes in the instruments held or in the financial markets in which the group operates could cause gains or losses to exceed the amounts projected.
Based on the composition of our net debt as at 16 September 2006, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional 2m in net interest expense being incurred per year.
