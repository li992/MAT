These individual expected returns are set having regard to market conditions at 1 January, and long-term expectation on the respective assets classes.
Further adjustments were made to the expected return on assets for the year to allow for contributions received by the scheme and for disbursements paid during the year.

x Future funding The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of FPPS was performed by an independent actuary and was carried out as at 30 September 2005.
From 1 July 2007 it has been decided to close the scheme to new members and existing members have been asked to increase their contributions of 3% by 1% per annum until 2010 if they wish to continue to retire at the age of 60, or reduce their contributions from 3% to 2% and increase their normal retirement age to 65.
Friends Provident has agreed to increase its contributions from 15% to 20%.
These arrangements have been put in place with a view to eliminating the deficit within 5 years.
A new defined contribution scheme will be in place for new employees.
A draft Statement of Funding Principles is being agreed by the Group and the Trustee.
The statement provides the principles around assumption setting, in particular, choosing the discount rate, future price inflation, future pension increases, rates of mortality, future pay increases, employee turnover, pension commencement age, and typical partner or dependant information.
In addition the Trustee has the following objectives for investments, as set out in the Statement of Investment Principles: To achieve and maintain a minimum funding level of 100% on a long-term ongoing basis: and To maintain the cost of providing the benefits at an acceptable level to the Employer.
Amounts paid to FPPS in the past 2 years and expected future payments over the next 5 years are as follows: m Contributions paid 2005 11 2006 14 Contributions expected to be paid 2007 19 2008 17 2009 16 2010 15 2011 14 Friends Provident Annual Report & Accounts 2006 101 17447 NewBackend Txt.

Staff pension schemes continued xi Risk Management The Trustee has established a separate investment subcommittee which is responsible for assisting the Trustee in investment policy and monitoring the Schemes investments.
The investment subcommittee seeks advice from the investment adviser and believes it has sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustee sets general investment policy but delegates day to day responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the Investment Manager.
The Trustee has set performance and risk targets for the Investment Manager.
The performance objectives are long-term 5 years, however, the Trustee monitors the Investment Manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that it is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
Interest rate and inflation risk In 2003, FPPS implemented a series of derivative hedges with Merrill Lynch swaps designed to hedge the interest rate and inflation sensitivities of the Schemes liabilities.
The fall in long-term interest rates compared to when the swaps were effected has meant that the value of the swaps has increased and broadly matched the increase in value of the liabilities.
In 2006, to achieve a better match to the liabilities, the inflation swaps were exchanged in November 2006 for positions in ten Liability Driven Investment LDI pools managed by F&C.
In addition, FPPS residual Government Bonds and Index linked bonds were exchanged for additional holdings in the LDI pools.
These pools are designed to achieve a good match to the interest rate and nominal sensitivities of the liabilities of FPPS liabilities.
The value of investment in LDI pools at 31 December 2006 was 256m.
Currency risk To increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the Scheme invests in overseas assets.
The Schemes liability is entirely in pound sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of pound sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas equities.
The Trustee has reviewed this risk and hedged one third of the overseas exposure on a strategic basis.
Operational risk The Investment Manager does not directly hold any of the Schemes securities.
These are held in a separate account with the custodian.
All organisations involved in stock lending are kept under review by the Investment Managers credit committee.
The borrowing organisations have to post collateral with the Scheme, which is marked to market on a daily basis.

Staff pension schemes continued d F&C Asset Management plc pension schemes F&C operates two core defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, one in The Netherlands and one in Portugal.
Both of the UK schemes are closed to new entrants with all new UK employees eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements.
The Chairman of F&C, Mr RW Jenkins, was awarded pension benefits by F&C Management Limited prior to completion of the merger of ISIS and F&C in respect of his past service to F&C.
This is an unfunded pensions liability and therefore the Group has made an appropriate provision in its accounts.
F&C Netherlands BV Prior to the merger with F&C, employee benefits in The Netherlands were provided through the Achmea pension plan.
Post-merger a separate insurance contract has been set up, with all assets and liabilities in respect of the F&C employees transferring to the new contract.
Existing benefits of the employees participating in the scheme have not been altered as a result of the transfer.
F&C Ireland Limited Employee benefits in Ireland are provided through the Friends First Retirement and Death Benefits Plan, in which F&C participates together with Friends First.
F&C have set up a separate new defined benefit plan and a process is underway to calculate the assets and liabilities that will transfer from the multi-employer plan to the new F&C plan.
This process had not been completed at 31 December 2006.
As the assets and liabilities are not identifiable at 31 December 2006, pension benefits provided through the Friends First plan have been accounted for as a multiemployer plan on a defined contribution basis.
Once the transfer of assets and liabilities to the F&C plan has completed, they will be separately identifiable and defined benefit accounting will be possible.
This new schemes trustee board consists of four trustees, two of whom are employer appointed and two of whom are member selected.
F&C Ireland Limited contributed 174,000 117,000 to the Friends First Retirement and Death Benefits Plan for the year.

Basis used to determine the expected rate of return on plan assets To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, F&C considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

x Future Funding requirements UK schemes The trustees of the ISIS Fund and F&C Mgt Fund have agreed to merge the schemes.
This is targeted to occur during 2007 and will be achieved by the transfer of all of the defined benefit assets and liabilities from the F&C Mgt Fund into the ISIS Fund.
The assets and liabilities will be merged on a co-mingled basis ie they will not be separately identifiable into F&C Mgt Fund or ISIS Fund sections.
In conjunction with this merger, special employer contributions totalling 8m will be paid into the ISIS Fund around the time of the merger with a view to improving the funding level of the merged scheme.
Following the merger, it is intended that a formal actuarial valuation will be performed.
This valuation will be subject to the requirements of the scheme funding regulations introduced under the Pensions Act 2004 and the funding principles are to be agreed between the trustees of the merged scheme and F&C.
The results of this formal valuation will help to determine the future level of employer contributions due to the merged scheme.
Until such time as any revision to employer contributions is agreed following this valuation, it is anticipated that employer contributions will continue initially at 25% of Pensionable Salaries for ex-ISIS Fund members and at 29.9% of Pensionable Salaries for ex-F&C Fund members.

Staff pension schemes continued Overseas schemes Given possible changes in overseas pension provision for example the new schemes set-up, there is some uncertainty on the future level of employer contributions that may be required.
The figures in the table below assume that contributions at the level paid in 2006 continue for the overseas schemes.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into the defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: m Contributions paid 2005 5 2006 4 Contributions expected to be paid 2007 12 2008 4 2009 4 2010 4 2011 4 xi Risk Management UK schemes The trustees of each scheme set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the Investment Manager.
The trustees regularly monitor the schemes investments.
The trustees seek advice from their investment adviser and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The trustees have set performance and risk targets for the Investment Manager.
The performance objectives are long term, however the trustees monitor the Investment Manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that the scheme is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
In conjunction with F&C, the trustees have recently conducted asset-liability review of the schemes.
These studies were used to assist the trustees and F&C to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the liabilities within the schemes, subject to an acceptable funding cost to F&C.
The results of the studies were also used to assist the trustees and F&C in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the schemes deficits by providing information used to determine the schemes investment strategy.
Asset allocation Following the asset-liability review, both the trustees of the F&C Mgt Fund and ISIS Fund have agreed with F&C that they will shortly implement a Liability Driven Investment LDI approach to their investment strategy.
This will involve the use of pooled LDI products managed by F&C.
The exact details of the investment strategy and asset allocation for the merged ISIS Fund are still being considered.
Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the schemes invest in overseas assets.
However, the schemes liabilities are entirely in pound sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of pound sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas equities.
