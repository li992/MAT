Restatement for first time adoption of revised UK GAAP As stated in the accounting policies, the Board has elected to continue to adopt UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP and therefore comply with the new Financial Reporting Standards issued as part of the programme to converge UK GAAP with IFRS.

No provision has therefore been made for the final dividend on Ordinary shares for the years ended 31 January 2005 and 2006.
The financial statements for the years ended 31 January 2004 and 2005 have been restated to remove the final dividends that were accrued at those dates.
Dividends are no longer recognised through the Income Statement, instead these are taken to the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders' Funds as an appropriation of equity.
