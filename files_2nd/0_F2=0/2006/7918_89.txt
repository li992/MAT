1 Basis of presentation of financial information continued The exemptions ICI has elected not to adopt include the following: a Share-based payments: The Group has not adopted the exemption to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to awards made after 7 November 2002, instead a full retrospective approach has been followed on all awards granted but not fully vested at the date of transition to maintain consistency across reporting periods.
Fair value disclosures in respect of share based incentive schemes have been previously made in the Groups US GAAP net income reconciliation in the Annual Report and Accounts.
b Fair value or revaluation at deemed cost: The Group has not adopted the exemption to restate items of property, plant and equipment to fair value at the transition date.
Such items have been maintained at historical cost in order to maintain consistency with previous Group policy.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement came into effect on 1 January 2005.
The European Commission has adopted a carved-out version of IAS 39, which excludes certain aspects of hedge accounting.
The endorsement of the full IAS 39 by the European Commission would have no effect on the results of the Group.
Continuing and Discontinued Operations For reporting purposes, the results in these financial statements differentiate between the Groups continuing and discontinued operations.
Discontinued operations are components of the Group representing separate major lines of business or geographical areas of operations, or are part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation and which have been sold, permanently terminated or classified as held for sale at the period end.
A component of the Group comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
All other operations are classified as continuing operations.
Transactions in these financial statements which are identified as relating to discontinued operations comprise items and associated tax effects in respect of the following operations: Quest currently held for sale, with the exception of the Quest Food Ingredients business divested in 2004 which is classified as continuing, Uniqema sold in 2006, and the Polyurethanes business, Tioxide business, selected Petrochemicals businesses, Acrylics business, Chlor-Chemicals business, Polyester business, Explosives business and Ethylene oxide business all of which were sold or terminated before 1 January 2004.
Non co-terminous year ends One subsidiary made up its statutory accounts to a date earlier than 31 December, but not earlier than 30 September: additionally three subsidiaries made up their local statutory accounts prior to 30 September.
All subsidiaries, including those with non co-terminous year ends, are required to prepare and submit their financial information for inclusion in the Group consolidated accounts in line with the Groups accounting period 1 January to 31 December.
There are consequently no adjustments to be made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between the date of the subsidiaries financial information and the date of the parents financial statements.
Critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Judgments made by management on the application of IFRS that have had a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustments in the next year are discussed in note 37.
