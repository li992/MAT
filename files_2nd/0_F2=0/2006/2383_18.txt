2 Resegmentation and other changes to comparatives With effect from 1 January 2006 the following changes to the business segment boundaries have been implemented: a Following the sale of Innovene to INEOS in December 2005, the transfer of three equity-accounted entities Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited in China and Polyethylene Malaysia Sdn Bhd and Ethylene Malaysia Sdn Bhd, both in Malaysia, previously reported in Other businesses and corporate, to Rening and Marketing.
b The formation of BP Alternative Energy in November 2005 has resulted in the transfer of certain mid-stream assets and activities to Gas, Power and Renewables: South Houston Green Power co-generation facility in the Texas City renery from Rening and Marketing.
Watson Cogeneration in the Carson renery from Rening and Marketing.
Phu My Phase 3 CCGT plant in Vietnam from Exploration and Production.
c The transfer of Hydrogen for Transport activities from Gas, Power and Renewables to Rening and Marketing.
Furthermore, in 2005, the basis of accounting for over-the-counter forward sale and purchase contracts for oil, natural gas, NGLs and power was changed.
Certain transactions are now reported on a net basis in sales and other operating revenues, whereas previously they had been reported gross in sales and purchases.
This change, while reducing sales and other operating revenues and purchases, had no impact on reported profit, profit per ordinary share, cash ow or the balance sheet.
During 2006, as part of a continuous process to review how individual contracts are accounted for, certain other minor adjustments have been identied that should have been reected in the restatement from gross to net presentation.
Although these adjustments are not significant to the group income statement, comparatives have been amended to bring them onto a basis which is consistent with the current year.
The impact of the changes described above is shown in the tables below.
