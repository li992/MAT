Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D: Life assurance business D1: Group overview a Products and classification for IFRS reporting The measurement basis of assets and liabilities of long-term business contracts is dependent upon the classification of the contracts under IFRS.
Under IFRS 4, contracts are initially classified as being either insurance contracts, if the level of insurance risk in the contracts is significant, or investment contracts, if the risk is insignificant.
A Insurance contracts Insurance contracts are permitted to be accounted for under previously applied GAAP.
The Group has chosen to adopt this approach.
However, as an improvement to accounting policy, permitted by IFRS 4, the Group has applied the measurement principles for with-profits contracts of UK regulated entities and disclosures of the UK Standard FRS 27 from 1 January 2005.
An explanation of the provisions under B FRS 27 is provided in note D2.
Under the previously applied GAAP, UK GAAP, the assets and liabilities of contracts are reported in accordance with the MSB of reporting as set out in the ABI SORP.
The insurance contracts of the Groups shareholder-backed business fall broadly into the following categories: C UK insurance operations bulk and individual annuity business, written primarily by Prudential Retirement Income Limited, Prudential Pensions Limited, and other categories of non-participating UK business: Jackson fixed and variable annuity business and life insurance: and D Prudential Corporation Asia non-participating term, whole life, and unit-linked policies, together with accident and health policies.
Investment contracts Investment contracts are further delineated under IFRS 4 between those with and without discretionary participation features.
For those contracts with discretionary participation features, IFRS 4 also permits the continued application of previously applied GAAP.
The Group E has adopted this approach, again subject to the FRS 27 improvement.
For investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participation features, IAS 39 and, where the contract includes an investment management element, IAS 18, apply measurement principles to assets and liabilities attaching to the contract that may diverge from those previously applied.
F Contracts of the Group, which are classified as investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participation features, whose assets and liabilities were required to be remeasured from 1 January 2005 under these two standards can be summarised as: UK certain unit-linked savings and similar contracts: G Jackson GICs and funding agreements minor amounts of annuity certain contracts: and Prudential Corporation Asia minor amounts for a number of small categories of business.
The accounting for the contracts of UK insurance operations and Jacksons GICs and funding agreements are considered in turn below: H i Certain UK unit-linked savings and similar contracts Deferred acquisition costs Acquisition costs are deferred to the extent that it is appropriate to recognise an asset that represents the entitys contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are amortised as the entity recognises the related revenue.
IAS 18 further I reduces the costs potentially capable of deferral to incremental costs only.
Deferred acquisition costs are amortised to the income statement in line with service provision.
Deferred income reserves These are required to be established under IAS 18 with amortisation over the expected life of the contract.
The majority of the relevant UK contracts are single premium with the initial deferred income reflecting the front-end load i. e. the difference between the premium paid and the amount credited to the unit fund.
Deferred income is amortised to the income statement in line with service provision.
The amortisation profile is either on a straight-line basis or, if more appropriate, a further deferral of income recognition is applied.
Sterling reserves Prudent provisions established for possible future expenses not covered by future margins at a policy level reflecting the regulatory approach in the UK are not permitted under IFRS 4.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 139 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D1: Group overview continued ii Jackson GICs and funding arrangments Under a traditional GIC, the policyholder makes a lump sum deposit.
The interest rate paid is fixed and established when the contract is issued.
Funding agreements are of a similar nature but the interest rate may be floating, based on a rate linked to an external index.
The US GAAP accounting requirements for such contracts are very similar to those under IFRS on the amortised cost model for A liability measurement.
b Concentration of risk i Business accepted The Group has a broadly based exposure to life assurance risk.
This is achieved through the geographical spread of the Groups operations B and, within those operations, through a broad mix of product types.
In addition, looking beyond pure insurance risk, the Group considers itself well developed in its approach to assessment of diversification benefits through its economic capital framework that is used for internal business management.
The economic capital methodology seeks to apply a single yardstick to assess and quantify all risks attaching to the Groups insurance business and associated capital requirements.
C Prudentials internal Group economic capital requirement is defined as the minimum amount of capital that the Group needs to hold in order to remain economically solvent over a 25-year horizon, given a target probability of insolvency appropriate for AA-rated debt.
The target confidence level is based on historic default rates for AA-rated debt, and varies over the time horizon of the projection.
The economic capital requirement is calculated in respect of existing contractual and discretionary liabilities only.
D For the purposes of calculating Group economic capital, Group economic solvency is defined as the position where both: a the capital balance of the parent company is positive, and b all business units are solvent on the applicable local regulatory basis.
This definition of solvency allows the Groups capital position to be assessed on an economic basis while taking into account the actual regulatory constraints at the business unit level.
E The Group economic capital position is calculated using the Group Solvency Model GSM an integrated stochastic asset liability model of the Group economic solvency position.
Projected economic scenarios in the GSM are generated using a stochastic economic scenario generator that captures all the correlations between different asset classes and geographies.
The Group regularly determines the level of capital required to cover the risks to its existing contractual and discretionary insurance F liabilities on an economic basis and its internal target solvency level.
This level of required capital is determined after allowance for diversification across risk and geographies and the capturing of future shareholders transfers from the business units.
This level is then compared with available capital on an equivalent basis i. e. GAAP based shareholders equity after eliminating goodwill and including subordinated debt capital and valuation differences.
The required capital is then analysed into its contributing parts by risk type namely asset liability matching, credit risk, underwriting, persistency and operational risk.
G The largest risk exposure on a diversified basis, credit risk, reflects the relative size of the exposure to Jackson, Prudential UK shareholder annuities business, and Egg.
An example of the diversification benefits for Prudential is that adverse scenarios do not affect all business units in the same way, providing natural hedges within the Group.
For example, the Groups US business is sensitive towards increasing interest rates, whereas, in contrast, H several business units in Asia benefit from increasing rates.
Conversely, these Asian business units are sensitive towards low interest rates, whereas the US benefits from falling interest rates.
The economic capital framework also takes into account situations where factors are correlated, for example the extent of correlation between Asian and US economies.
ii Ceded business I The Group cedes certain business to other insurance companies.
Although the ceding of insurance does not relieve the Group of liability to its policyholders, the Group participates in such agreements for the purpose of managing its loss exposure.
The Group evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimise its exposure from reinsurer insolvencies.
There are no significant concentrations of reinsurance risk.
c Guarantees Notes D2 b, D3 b, D4 b and D4 h provide details of guarantee features of the Groups life assurance products.
In the UK, guarantees of the with-profits products are valued for accounting purposes on a market consistent basis for 2006 as described in section D2 d ii.
The UK business also has products with guaranteed annuity option features, mostly within SAIF, as described in section D2 b.
There is little exposure to financial options and guarantees in the shareholder-backed business of the UK operations.
The US business annuity products have a variety of option and guarantee features as described in section D3 b. Jacksons derivative programme seeks to manage the exposures as described in section D3 c. The most significant exposure for the Group arises on Taiwan whole of life policies as described in section D4 h. 140 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D1: Group overview continued d Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts The factors that affect the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts depend upon the businesses concerned as described in subsequent sections.
In general terms, the Group is managed by reference to a combination of measures.
These measures include IFRS basis earnings, net shareholder cash flow to or from business units from or to central funds, and movements A in the present value of future expected distributable earnings of in-force long-term insurance business.
The latter item when added to the net assets is commonly referred to as Embedded Value.
The Group prepares and publishes supplementary information in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV principles issued by the CFO Forum of European Insurance Companies in May 2004 and expanded by the addition of Additional Guidance on EEV Disclosures B published in October 2005.
Key elements of the EEV principles are the approach applied to allowing for risk and the use of best estimate assumptions to project future cash flows arising from the contracts.
The business covered by the EEV basis results includes both investment contracts as well as insurance contracts as defined under IFRS 4.
Investment contracts form a relatively small part of the Groups long-term business as demonstrated by the carrying value of policyholder C liabilities shown in the Group balance sheet.
The projected cash flows are those expected to arise under the contracts such as those arising from premiums, claims and expenses after appropriate allowance for future lapse behaviour and mortality and morbidity experience.
The cash flows also include the expected future cash flows on assets covering liabilities and encumbered capital.
D Encumbered capital is based on the Groups internal target for economic capital subject to it meeting at least the local statutory minimum requirements.
Economic capital is assessed using internal models but does not take credit for the significant diversification benefits that exist within the Group.
The valuation of the future cash flows also takes account of the time value of option and guarantee features of the Groups long-term E business contracts.
The time value reflects the variability of economic outcomes in the future.
Where appropriate, a full stochastic valuation is undertaken to determine the value of the in-force business.
Common principles are adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset model classes, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
In deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging F investment and fund solvency conditions are modelled.
In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options actually available to management.
For the PAC with-profits sub-fund, the actions are consistent with those set out in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management.
The present value of the future distributable earnings is calculated using a risk discount rate which reflects both the time value of money and the risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.
The risk allowance covers market and non-market risks.
G Under Capital Asset Pricing Methodology CAPM, the discount rate is determined as the aggregate of the risk-free rate and the risk margin for market risk.
The latter is calculated as the beta times the equity risk premium.
Under CAPM, the beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk.
The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product cash flows.
They are determined by considering how the profits from each product are impacted by changes in expected returns H on various asset classes, and by converting this into a relative rate of return, it is possible to derive a product specific beta.
Product specific discount rates are used in order to reflect the risk profile of each major territory and product group.
No allowance is required for non-market risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.
The majority of non-market risks are considered to be diversifiable.
Finance theory cannot be used to determine the appropriate component of beta for non-diversifiable non-market risks since I there is no observable risk premium associated with it that is akin to the equity risk premium.
Recognising this, a pragmatic approach has been used.
A constant margin of 50 basis points 2005: 50 basis points has been added to the risk margin derived for market risk to cover the non-diversifiable non-market risks associated with the business.
For the UK shareholder-backed annuity business an additional margin of 100 basis points was used 2005: 100 basis points.
Product level betas are calculated each year.
They are combined with the most recent product mix to produce appropriate betas and risk discount rates for each major product grouping.
Details of the key assumptions and sensitivity of the EEV value of in-force business are shown in the sections for each geographic segment that follow in this note.
The sensitivity of the present value of the discounted future cash flows under the EEV methodology is of particular interest.
The sensitivity provides an indication of the movement in the net value ascribable to potential variations in the amounts and timing of future cash flows to shareholders and the uncertainty attached to those cash flows.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 141 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D1: Group overview continued e Sensitivity of IFRS basis profit or loss and equity to changes that have a material effect The factors that may significantly affect IFRS results due to changes of experience or assumptions vary significantly between business units.
The most significant items are summarised below.
A UK insurance operations With-profits business investment performance subject to smoothing through declared bonuses: unit-linked business investment performance through fund management fees: and annuity business mortality experience and assumptions and credit risk.
B Jackson Variable annuity business fund management performance and incidence of guarantee features of the contracts: fixed annuity business spread differential between earned rate and rate credited to policyholder: and C fixed indexed annuity business spread differential between earned rate and rate credited to policyholder and incidence of equity index participation features.
Asian operations With-profits business as for UK insurance operations: D unit-linked business as for UK insurance operations: and non-participating business return on assets covering the Taiwan whole of life policies.
Where appropriate these issues are discussed in notes D2, D3 and D4.
E Lapse risk is not mentioned above and has variable impacts.
In the UK, adverse persistency experience has led to losses in embedded value in 2005 and to a much lesser extent in 2006 reflecting a reduced level of projected statutory transfers from the PAC with-profits subfund.
However, in any given year, the statutory transfer recognised in IFRS profits is only marginally affected by altered persistency trends.
Jackson is sensitive to lapse risk.
However, Jackson has swaption derivatives in place to ameliorate the effect of a sharp rise in interest F rates, which would be the most likely cause of a sudden change in policyholder behaviour.
f Duration of liabilities Under the terms of the Groups contracts, as for life assurance contracts generally, the contractual maturity date is the earlier of the end of the contract term, death, other insurable events or surrender.
The Group has therefore chosen to provide details of liability duration that G reflect the actuarially determined best estimate of the likely incidence of these factors on contract duration.
Details are shown in sections D2 i, D3 i and D4 i.
Effective interest rates, as defined in IAS 32, are not applicable to the Groups insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features.
In the years 2002 to 2006, claims paid on the Groups life assurance contracts including those now classified as investment contracts H under IFRS 4 ranged from 11.8 billion to 15.9 billion.
Indicatively it is to be expected that of the Groups policyholder liabilities excluding unallocated surplus at 31 December 2006 of 165 billion, the amounts likely to be paid in 2007 will be of a similar magnitude.

ii Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF is a separate sub-fund within the PAC long-term business fund.
H iii Wholly-owned subsidiary of the PAC WPSF that writes annuity business.
iv Excluding policyholder liabilities of the Hong Kong branch of PAC.
v Within policyholder liabilities of 19,835 million for the non-profit unit-linked and other business is 17,679 million for unit-linked business.
b Products and guarantees I Prudentials long-term products in the UK consist of life insurance, pension products and pension annuities.
These products are written primarily in: one of three separate sub-funds of the PAC long-term fund, namely the with-profits sub-fund, the SAIF, and the non-profit sub-fund: Prudential Annuities Limited, which is owned by the PAC with-profits sub-fund: Prudential Retirement Income Limited, a shareholder-owned subsidiary: or other shareholder-backed subsidiaries writing mainly non-profit unit-linked business.
144 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D2: UK insurance operations continued i With-profits products and PAC with-profits sub-fund Within the balance sheet of UK insurance operations at 31 December 2006, there are policyholder liabilities of 74.1 billion 2005: 73.2 billion and unallocated surplus of 13.5 billion 2005: 11.2 billion that relate to the WPSF.
The WPSF mainly contains with-profits business but it also contains some non-profit business unit-linked, term assurances and annuities.
The WPSFs profits are apportioned A 90 per cent to its policyholders and 10 per cent to shareholders as surplus for distribution is determined via the annual actuarial valuation.
With-profits products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed.
There are two types of bonuses: annual and final.
Annual bonuses are declared once a year, and once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike annual bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
B When determining policy payouts, including final bonuses, Prudential considers policyholders reasonable expectations, the need to smooth claim values and payments from year to year and competitive considerations, together with asset shares for specimen policies.
Asset shares broadly reflect the value of premiums paid plus the investment return on the assets notionally attributed to the policy, less the other items to be charged such as expenses and the cost of the life insurance cover.
C For many years, UK with-profits product providers, such as Prudential, have been required by law and regulation to consider the reasonable expectations of policyholders in setting bonus levels.
This concept is established by statute but is not defined.
However, it is defined within the regulatory framework, which also more recently contains an explicit requirement to treat customers fairly.
The WPSF held a provision of 47 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 52 million to honour guarantees on a small amount of D guaranteed annuity products.
SAIFs exposure to guaranteed annuities is described below.
Beyond the generic guarantees described above, there are very few explicit options or guarantees such as minimum investment returns, surrender values or annuities at retirement and any granted have generally been at very low levels.
E ii Annuity business Prudentials conventional annuities include level, fixed increase and retail price index RPI annuities.
They are mainly written within the subsidiaries PAL, PRIL, Prudential Pensions Limited and the PAC with-profits sub-fund, but there are some annuity liabilities in the non-profit sub-fund and SAIF.
F Prudentials fixed-increase annuities incorporate automatic increases in annuity payments by fixed amounts over the policyholders life.
The RPI annuities that Prudential offers provide for a regular annuity payment to which an additional amount is added periodically based on the increase in the UK RPI.
Prudentials with-profits annuities, which are written in the WPSF, combine the income features of annuity products with the investment smoothing features of with-profits products and enable policyholders to obtain exposure to investment return on the WPSFs equity G shares, property and other investment categories over time.
Policyholders select an anticipated bonus from the specific range Prudential offers for the particular product.
The amount of the annuity payment each year depends upon the relationship between the anticipated bonus rate selected by the policyholder when the product is purchased and the bonus rates Prudential subsequently declares each year during the term of the product.
If the total bonus rates fall below the anticipated rate, then the annuity income falls.
H At 31 December 2006, 29.0 billion 2005: 25.3 billion of investments relate to annuity business of PAL and PRIL.
These investments are predominantly in debt securities including retail price index-linked bonds to match retail price index-linked annuities, loans and deposits and are duration matched with the estimated duration of the liabilities they support.
iii SAIF I SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC long-term fund formed following the acquisition of the mutually owned Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society in 1997.
No new business may be written in SAIF, although regular premiums are still being paid on policies in force at the time of the acquisition and incremental premiums are permitted on these policies.
The fund is solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of this fund although they are entitled to investment management fees on this business.
The process for determining policyholder bonuses of SAIF with-profits policies, which constitute the vast majority of obligations of the funds, is similar to that for the with-profits policies of the WPSF.
However, in addition, the surplus assets in SAIF are allocated to policies in an orderly and equitable distribution over time as enhancements to policyholder benefits i. e. in excess of those based on asset share.
Provision is made for the risks attaching to some SAIF unitised with-profits policies that have MVR-free dates and for those SAIF products which have a guaranteed minimum benefit on death or maturity of premiums accumulated at four per cent per annum.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuities in the UK is through SAIF and a provision of 561 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2006 2005: 619 million to honour the guarantees.
As SAIF is a separate sub-fund solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF this provision has no impact on the financial position of the Groups shareholders equity.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 145 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D2: UK insurance operations continued iv Unit-linked non-annuity and other non-profit business Prudential UK insurance operations also have an extensive book of unit-linked policies of varying types and provide a range of other non-profit business such as credit life and protection contracts.
These contracts do not contain significant financial guarantees.
A There are no guaranteed maturity values or guaranteed annuity options on unit-linked policies except for minor amounts for certain policies linked to cash units within SAIF.
c Exposure to market risk i Non-linked life and pension business B For with-profits business, the absence of guaranteed surrender values and the flexibility given by the operation of the bonus system means that the majority of the investments backing the with-profits business are in equities and real estate with the balance in debt securities, deposits and loans.
The investments supporting the protection business are small in value and tend to be fixed maturities reflecting the guaranteed nature C of the liabilities.
ii Pension annuity business Prudentials UK annuity business employs fixed income investments including UK retail price index-linked assets because the liabilities consist of guaranteed payments for as long as each annuitant or surviving partner is alive.
Retail price index-linked assets are used to back D pension annuities where the payments are linked to the RPI.
iii Unit-linked business Except through the second order effect on investment management fees, the unit-linked business of the UK insurance operations is not exposed to market risk.
The lack of exposure arises from the contract nature whereby policyholder benefits reflect asset value movements of the unit-linked funds.
E d Process for setting assumptions and determining liabilities i Overview The calculation of the contract liabilities involves the setting of assumptions for future experience.
This is done following detailed review of the relevant experience including, in particular, mortality, expenses, tax, economic assumptions and where applicable, persistency.
F For with-profits business written in the WPSF or SAIF, a market consistent valuation is performed as described in section ii below.
Additional assumptions required are for persistency and the management actions under which the fund is managed.
Assumptions used for a market consistent valuation typically do not contain margins, whereas those used for the valuation of other classes of business do.
G Mortality assumptions are set based on the results of the most recent experience analysis looking at the experience over recent years of the relevant business.
For non-profit business, a margin for adverse deviation is added.
Different assumptions are applied for different product groups.
For annuitant mortality, assumptions for current mortality rates are based on recent experience investigations and expected future improvements in mortality.
The expected future improvements are based on recent experience and projections of the business and industry experience generally.
H Maintenance and, for some classes of business, termination expense assumptions are expressed as per policy amounts.
They are set based on the expenses incurred during the year, including an allowance for ongoing investment expenditure and allocated between entities and product groups in accordance with the operations internal cost allocation model.
For non-profit business a margin for adverse deviation is added to this amount.
Expense inflation assumptions are set consistent with the economic basis and based on the difference I between yields on nominal gilts and index-linked gilts.
The actual renewal expenses charged to SAIF will continue to be based on the tariff arrangement specified in the Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society Scheme until 31 December 2007, when the tariff arrangement terminates.
This provides an additional margin in SAIF as the unit costs derived from actual expenses and used to derive the recommended assumptions are generally significantly greater than the tariff costs.
The assumptions for investment management expenses are based on the charges specified in agreements with the Groups investment management operations, plus a margin for adverse deviation for non-profit business.
Tax assumptions are set equal to current rates of taxation.
For non-profit business excluding unit-linked business, the valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are based on the yields as at the valuation date on the assets backing the technical provisions.
For fixed interest securities the gross redemption yield is used except for the PAL and PRIL annuity business where the internal rate of return of the assets backing the liabilities is used.
For property it is the rental yield, and for equities it is the greater of the dividend yield and the average of the dividend yield and the earnings yield.
An adjustment is made to the yield on non risk-free fixed interest securities and property to reflect credit risk.
To calculate the non-unit reserves for linked business, assumptions have been set for the gross unit growth rate and the rate of inflation of maintenance expenses, as well as for the valuation interest rate as described above.
146 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D2: UK insurance operations continued ii WPSF and SAIF The policyholder liabilities reported for the WPSF are primarily for two broad types of business.
These are accumulating and conventional with-profits contracts.
The policyholder liabilities of the WPSF are accounted for under FRS 27.
A The provisions have been determined on a basis consistent with the detailed methodology included in regulations contained in the FSAs rules for the determination of reserves on the FSAs realistic Peak 2 basis.
In aggregate, the regime has the effect of placing a value on the liabilities of UK with-profits contracts, which reflects the amounts expected to be paid based on the current value of investments held by the with-profits funds and current circumstances.
These contracts are a combination of insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features, as defined by IFRS 4.
B The FSAs Peak 2 calculation under the new realistic regime, which came fully into effect for the first time for 2004 regulatory reporting requires the value of liabilities to be calculated as: the with-profits benefits reserve WPBR : plus C future policy related liabilities FPRL : plus the realistic current liabilities of the fund.
The WPBR is primarily based on the retrospective calculation of accumulated asset shares but is adjusted to reflect future expected policyholder benefits and other outgoings.
By contrast, the Peak 1 basis addresses, at least explicitly, only declared bonuses.
D Asset shares are calculated as the accumulation of all items of income and outgo that are relevant to each policy type.
Income comprises credits for premiums, investment returns including unrealised gains, and miscellaneous profits.
Outgo comprises charges for tax including an allowance for tax on unrealised gains, guarantees and smoothing, mortality and morbidity, shareholders profit transfers, miscellaneous losses, and expenses and commission net of any tax relief.
E The FPRL must include a market consistent valuation of costs of guarantees, options and smoothing, less any related charges, and this amount must be determined using either a stochastic approach, hedging costs or a series of deterministic projections with attributed probabilities.
The assumptions used in the stochastic models are calibrated to produce risk-free returns on each asset class.
Volatilities of, and correlations F between, investment returns from different asset classes are as determined by the Groups Portfolio Management Group and aim to be market consistent.
The cost of guarantees, options and smoothing is very sensitive to the bonus, market value reduction MVR, and investment policy employed and therefore the stochastic modelling incorporates a range of management actions that would help to protect the fund in adverse investment scenarios.
Substantial flexibility has been included in the modelled management actions in order to reflect the G discretion that is retained in adverse investment conditions, thereby avoiding the creation of unreasonable minimum capital requirements.
The management actions assumed are consistent with the Groups management policy for with-profits funds and the Groups disclosures in the publicly available Principles and Practices of Financial Management.
The contract liabilities for with-profits business also required assumptions for persistency.
These are set based on the results of recent H experience analysis.
iii Annuity business The contract liabilities for PAL and PRIL are based on the FSA regulatory solvency basis.
The valuation is then modified for IFRS reporting purposes to remove certain of the margins for prudence within the assumptions, and contingency reserves, both of which are required I under the solvency basis applied for regulatory purposes, but not for financial accounting.
The contract liabilities are the discounted value of future claim payments, adjusted for investment expenses and future administration costs.
The interest rates used for discounting claim payments are derived from the yields on the assets held with an allowance for default and mismatching risk.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 147 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D2: UK insurance operations continued The mortality assumptions are set in light of recent population and internal experience.
The assumptions used are percentages of standard actuarial mortality tables with an allowance for future mortality improvements.
Where annuities have been sold on an enhanced basis to impaired lives an additional age adjustment is made.
The percentages of the standard table used are selected according to the source of business.
The range of percentages used is set out in the following tables: A PAL PRIL 2006 Males Females Males Females In payment 106% 126% PNMA00 84% 117% PNFA00 99% 114% PNMA00 85% 103% PNFA00 B C 2000 with C 2000 with 75% C 2000 with C 2000 with 75% medium cohort of medium cohort medium cohort of medium cohort improvement table improvement table improvement table improvement table with a minimum annual with a minimum annual with a minimum annual with a minimum annual improvement of 1.25% improvement of 0.75% improvement of 1.25% improvement of 0.75% C In deferment AM92 minus 4 years AF92 minus 4 years AM92 minus 4 years AF92 minus 4 years PAL PRIL 2005 Males Females Males Females D In payment 93% 100% PMA92 84% 105% PFA92 88% 100% PMA92 84% 102% PFA92 C 2004 with C 2004 with 75% C 2004 with C 2004 with 75% medium cohort of medium cohort medium cohort of medium cohort improvement table improvement table improvement table improvement table E with a minimum annual with a minimum annual with a minimum annual with a minimum annual improvement of 1.25% improvement of 0.75% improvement of 1.25% improvement of 0.75% In deferment AM92 minus 4 years AF92 minus 4 years AM92 minus 4 years AF92 minus 4 years PAL PRIL F 2004 Males Females Males Females In payment 97% 111% PMA92 92% 105% PFA92 90% 113% PMA92 85% 104% PFA92 C 2004 with C 2004 with 75% of C 2004 with C 2004 with 75% medium cohort medium cohort medium cohort of medium cohort G improvement table improvement table improvement table improvement table with a minimum annual with a minimum annual with a minimum annual with a minimum annual improvement of 1.25% improvement of 0.75% improvement of 1.25% improvement of 0.75% In deferment AM92 minus 4 years AF92 minus 4 years AM92 minus 4 years AF92 minus 4 years H iv Unit-linked non-annuity and other non-profit business The majority of other long-term business written in the UK insurance operations is unit-linked business or other business with similar features.
For these contracts the attaching liability reflects the unit value obligation and provision for expenses and mortality risk.
The latter component is determined by applying mortality assumptions on a basis that is appropriate for the policyholder profile.
I For unit-linked business, the assets covering unit liabilities are exposed to market risk, but the residual risk when considering the unitlinked liabilities and assets together is limited to the effect on fund-based charges.
For those contracts where the level of insurance risk is insignificant the assets and liabilities arising under the contracts are distinguished between those that relate to the financial instrument liability and acquisition costs and deferred income that relate to the component of the contract that relates to investment management.
Acquisition costs and deferred income are recognised consistent with the level of service provision in line with the requirements of IAS 18. e Reinsurance The Groups UK insurance business cedes only minor amounts of business outside the Group.
During 2006, reinsurance premiums for externally ceded business were 58 million 2005: 82 million and reinsurance recoverable insurance assets were 510 million 2005: 750 million in aggregate.
The gains and losses recognised in profit and loss for these contracts were immaterial.
148 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D2: UK insurance operations continued f Effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities 2006 For with-profits business, there was no significant change in assumptions in 2006.
A There was no change in mortality assumptions for PAL in 2006 which had a material effect on the measurement of the insurance liabilities.
Liabilities for PAL were increased by 47 million for the effect of change of assumptions for renewal expenses.
As PAL is owned by the WPSF, this change had no effect on shareholder profit.
In 2006, the FSA made regulatory changes for UK regulated shareholder-backed non-participating business.
These changes were B proposed in the consultative paper CP06 16 and confirmed in December 2006 policy statement PS06 14.
The changes to the FSA rules allow insurance liabilities for this business to incorporate more realism.
In particular this is achieved by: setting technical provisions for expenses not directly attributable to one particular contract at a homogenous risk group level and not, as previously, at an individual contract level for all non-profit business: and C recognising the economic effect of making a prudent lapse rate assumption.
Previously, no lapses were assumed.
Under IFRS 4, the effect of this change is accounted for as a change in estimate and there is a consequent increase in operating profit based on longer-term investment returns of 46 million.
D In addition to the 46 million credit described above, a charge of 4 million was recognised in 2006 for the effect of change of assumption for renewal and termination expenses mainly in respect of PAC.
2005 For with-profits business the only significant change for 2005 was an altered basis of recognising liabilities and unallocated surplus for E SAIF.
This was to comply with actuarial guidance GN 45, which requires that for a closed fund where the fund will be distributed fully that the working capital is shown as zero, with the future enhancements to asset shares being increased by the free capital.
Without the adjustment the unallocated surplus would have been approximately 700 million.
Shareholder results and equity were not altered by this change.
F The change of mortality table for PAL explained in section D2 d increased liabilities by 144 million.
As PAL is owned by the WPSF this change had no affect on shareholder profit.
For shareholder-backed non-participating business a number of changes of assumptions were made in 2005.
Taken together these changes had the effect of reducing operating profit based on longer-term investment returns before shareholder tax by 36 million with consequent increase in liabilities.
The reduction arose from a charge of 69 million for strengthened mortality assumptions, being partially G offset by a net credit of 29 million in respect of a reduced level of expected defaults for debt securities, and a credit of 4 million for other changes.
As described in section A4, the Group provides supplementary analysis of its profit before shareholder tax, distinguishing operating profit based on longer-term investment returns from short-term fluctuations in investment returns, actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit H pension schemes, and exceptional items.
In addition to the 36 million charge described above, an additional 20 million charge for 2005 for the effect of change of assumption for renewal expenses, which relates to an increase in ongoing future pension scheme contributions as described in section B1, was recorded as part of actuarial and other gains and losses excluded from operating profit but included in total profit before shareholder tax.
I The net charge of 36 million comprised amounts in respect of PAC 35 million charge, Prudential Holborn Life 2 million credit and PRIL 3 million charge.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 149 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D2: UK insurance operations continued g Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts At 31 December 2006, the EEV basis value of in-force business of UK insurance operations, after taking account of the cost of encumbered capital and the cost of the time value of financial options and guarantees, was 4,835 million 2005: 4,274 million.
This value has been determined after applying the principles of valuation described in note D1 and the following key assumptions.
A 2006 2005 % % Risk discount rate for in-force business at the start of the year 8.0 7.7 Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: B UK equities 8.6 8.1 Overseas equities 8.6 to 9.3 8.1 to 8.75 Property 7.1 6.4 Gilts 4.6 4.1 Corporate bonds 5.3 4.9 C Expected long-term rate of inflation 3.1 2.9 Post-tax expected long-term nominal rate of return for the with-profits sub-fund Pensions business where no tax applies 7.5 7.1 Life business 6.6 6.3 D The sensitivity of the value of in-force business and net worth to changes in key assumptions is as follows: m m Economic assumptions: Discount rates 1% increase 480 432 E Interest rates including consequential changes for assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of debt securities, and all risk discount rates : 1% increase note 55 69 1% decrease note 70 99 F Equity property yields 1% rise 382 297 Equity property market values 10% fall 502 480 Non-economic assumptions: Maintenance expenses 10% decrease 33 33 Lapse rates 10% decrease 75 68 G Mortality and morbidity 5% decrease in base rates i. e. increased longevity 87 62 Note 2005 comparatives have been adjusted to reflect refinements to the methodology in UK insurance operations, for the effect of interest rate movements.
h Sensitivity of IFRS basis profit or loss and equity to changes that have a material effect H The primary sensitivities that have a material effect on the IFRS basis results of the UK insurance operations relate to asset liability matching and mortality experience for shareholder-backed annuity business.
Further details are described below.
i With-profits business SAIF I Shareholders have no interest in the profits of SAIF but are entitled to the investment management fees paid on the business.
With-profits sub-fund business For with-profits business including non-participating business of PAL which is owned by the WPSF adjustments to liabilities and any related tax effects are recognised in the income statement.
However, except for any impact on the annual declaration of bonuses, shareholders profit for with-profits business is unaffected.
This is because IFRS basis profits for with-profits business, which are determined on the same basis as on preceding UK GAAP, solely reflect one-ninth of the cost of bonuses declared for the year.
The main factors that influence the determination of bonus rates are the return on the investments of the fund, the effect of inflation, taxation, the expenses of the fund chargeable to policyholders and the degree to which investment returns are smoothed.
Mortality and other insurance risk are relatively minor factors.
Unallocated surplus represents the excess of assets over policyholder liabilities of the fund.
As unallocated surplus of the WPSF is recorded as a liability, movements in its value do not affect shareholders profits or equity.
The level of unallocated surplus is particularly sensitive to the level of investment returns on the portion of the life fund assets that represents the surplus.
The effects for 2006 and 2005 are demonstrated in note D5.
150 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D2: UK insurance operations continued ii Shareholder-backed annuity business Profits from shareholder-backed annuity business are most sensitive to: the extent to which the duration of the assets held closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities under the contracts.
Assuming A close matching, the impact of short-term asset value movements as a result of interest rate movements will broadly offset changes in the value of liabilities caused by movements in valuation rates of interest: actual versus expected default rates on assets held: the difference between long-term rates of return on corporate bonds and risk-free rates: B the variance between actual and expected mortality experience: the extent to which expected future mortality experience gives rise to changes in the measurement of liabilities: and changes in renewal expense levels.
C A decrease in assumed mortality rates of one per cent would decrease gross profits by approximately 34 million 2005: 33 million.
A decrease in credit default assumptions of five basis points would increase gross profits by 64 million 2005: 65 million.
A decrease in renewal expenses excluding investment management expenses of five per cent would increase gross profits by 14 million 2005: 12 million.
The effect on profits would be approximately symmetrical for changes in assumptions that are directionally opposite to those D explained above.
iii Unit-linked and other business Unit-linked and other business represents a comparatively small proportion of the in-force business of the UK insurance operations.
Profits from unit-linked and similar contracts primarily arise from the excess of charges to policyholders, for management of assets under E the Companys stewardship, over expenses incurred.
The former is most sensitive to the net accretion of funds under management as a function of new business and lapse and mortality experience.
The accounting impact of the latter is dependent upon the amortisation of acquisition costs in line with the emergence of margins for insurance contracts and amortisation in line with service provision for the investment management component of investment contracts.
By virtue of the design features of most of the contracts which provide low F levels of mortality cover, the profits are relatively insensitive to changes in mortality experience.
iv Exposure to interest rate risk By virtue of the fund structure, product features and basis of accounting described in note D2 b and d, the policyholder liabilities of the UK insurance operations are, except for pension annuity business, not generally exposed to interest rate risk.
For pension annuity, business liabilities are exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
However, the net exposure to the PAC WPSF for PAL and shareholders for liabilities G of PRIL and the non-profit sub-fund is very substantially ameliorated by virtue of the close matching of assets with appropriate duration.
i Duration of liabilities With the exception of most unitised with-profits bonds and other whole of life contracts the majority of the contracts of the UK insurance operations have a contract term.
However, in effect, the maturity term of contracts reflects the earlier of death, maturity, or lapsation.
H In addition, with-profit contract liabilities as noted in note D2 d above include projected future bonuses based on current investment values.
The actual amounts payable will vary with future investment performance of SAIF and the WPSF.
To ascribe particular amounts payable to these contracts in future years does not provide appropriate information.
The tables below show the carrying value of the policyholder liabilities.
Separately, the Group uses cash flow projections of expected I benefit payments as part of the determination of the value of in-force business when preparing EEV basis results.
The tables below also show the maturity profile of the cash flows used for 2006 and 2005 for that purpose for insurance contracts, as defined by IFRS, i. e. those containing significant insurance risk, and investment contracts, which do not.

The liabilities under these funding arrangements totalled 2,552 million 2005: 3,267 million and C are included in other non-insurance liabilities in the balance sheet above.
b Products and guarantees Jackson provides long-term savings and retirement products to retail and institutional customers throughout the US.
Jackson offers fixed annuities interest-sensitive, fixed indexed and immediate annuities, variable annuities VA, life insurance and institutional products.
D i Fixed annuities Interest-sensitive annuities At 31 December 2006, interest-sensitive fixed annuities accounted for 31 per cent 2005: 36 per cent of policy and contract liabilities of Jackson.
Interest-sensitive fixed annuities are primarily deferred annuity products that are used for retirement planning and for providing E income in retirement.
They permit tax-deferred accumulation of funds and flexible payout options.
The policyholder of an interest-sensitive fixed annuity pays Jackson a premium, which is credited to the policyholders account.
Periodically, interest is credited to the policyholders account and in some cases administrative charges are deducted from the policyholders account.
Jackson makes benefit payments at a future date as specified in the policy based on the value of the policyholders F account at that date.
The policy provides that at Jacksons discretion it may reset the interest rate, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
The minimum guarantee varies from 1.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent 2005: 1.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent depending on the jurisdiction of issue and the date of issue, with 80 per cent 2005: 73 per cent of the fund at three per cent or less.
The average guarantee rate is 3.1 per cent 2005: 3.3 per cent.
G Approximately 35 per cent 2005: 29 per cent of the interest-sensitive fixed annuities Jackson wrote in 2006 provide for a market value adjustment, that could be positive or negative, on surrenders in the surrender period of the policy.
This formula-based adjustment approximates the change in value that assets supporting the product would realise as interest rates move up or down.
The minimum guaranteed rate is not affected by this adjustment.
H Fixed indexed annuities Fixed indexed annuities accounted for seven per cent 2005: seven per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December 2006.
Fixed indexed annuities vary in structure, but generally are deferred annuities that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return based on participation rates and caps but provide a guaranteed minimum return.
These guaranteed minimum rates I are generally set at three per cent.
Jackson hedges the equity return risk on fixed indexed products using futures and options linked to the relevant index.
The cost of these hedges is taken into account in setting the index participation rates and caps.
Jackson bears the investment and surrender risk on these products.
Immediate annuities At 31 December 2006, immediate annuities accounted for two per cent 2005: two per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
Immediate annuities guarantee a series of payments beginning within a year of purchase and continuing over either a fixed period of years and or the life of the policyholder.
If the term is for the life of the policyholder, then Jacksons primary risk is mortality risk.
The implicit interest rate on these products is based on the market conditions that exist at the time the policy is issued and is guaranteed for the term of the annuity.
154 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D3: US operations continued ii Variable annuities At 31 December 2006, VAs accounted for 38 per cent 2005: 32 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
VAs are deferred annuities that have the same tax advantages and payout options as interest-sensitive and fixed indexed annuities.
A The primary differences between VAs and interest-sensitive or fixed indexed annuities are investment risk and return.
If a policyholder chooses a VA, the rate of return depends upon the performance of the selected fund portfolio.
Policyholders may allocate their investment to either the fixed or variable account.
Investment risk on the variable account is borne by the policyholder, while investment risk on the fixed account is borne by Jackson through guaranteed minimum fixed rates of return.
At 31 December 2006, approximately 13 per cent 2005: 19 per cent of VA funds were in fixed accounts.
B Jackson issues VA contracts where it contractually guarantees to the contractholder either a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals, b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return, or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death guaranteed minimum death benefit GMDB, C annuitisation guaranteed minimum income benefit GMIB, or at specified dates during the accumulation period guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit GMWB.
Jackson hedges these risks using equity options and futures contracts as described in note D3 c. iii Life insurance Jacksons life insurance products accounted for 10 per cent 2005: nine per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December D 2006.
The products offered include variable universal life insurance, term life insurance and interest-sensitive life insurance.
iv Institutional products Jacksons institutional products consist of GICs, funding agreements including agreements issued in conjunction with Jacksons participation in the US Federal Home Loan Bank programme and medium-term note funding agreements.
At 31 December 2006, E institutional products accounted for 12 per cent of policy and contract liabilities 2005: 14 per cent.
Under a traditional GIC, the policyholder makes a lump sum deposit.
If deposited funds are withdrawn earlier than the specified term of the contract, an adjustment is made that approximates a market value adjustment.
Under a funding agreement, the policyholder either makes a lump sum deposit or makes specified periodic deposits.
Jackson agrees to F pay a rate of interest, which may be fixed but which is usually a floating short-term interest rate linked to an external index.
The average term of the funding arrangements is one to two years.
Funding agreements terminable by the policyholder with less than 90 days notice account for less than one per cent 2005: one per cent of total policyholder reserves.
Medium-term note funding agreements are generally issued to support trust instruments issued on non-US exchanges or to qualified investors as defined by SEC Rule 144A.
Through the funding agreements, Jackson agrees to pay a rate of interest, which may be fixed G or floating, to the holders of the trust instruments.
c Risk management Jacksons main exposures to market risk are through its exposure to interest rate risk and equity risk.
Approximately 89 per cent 2005: 88 per cent of its general account investments support interest-sensitive and fixed indexed annuities, life business and surplus and 11 per H cent 2005: 12 per cent support institutional business.
All of these types of business contain considerable interest rate guarantee features and, consequently, require that the assets that support them are primarily fixed income or fixed maturity.
Prudential is exposed primarily to the following risks in the US arising from fluctuations in interest rates: I the risk of loss related to meeting guaranteed rates of accumulation following a sharp and sustained fall in interest rates: the risk of loss related to policyholder withdrawals following a sharp and sustained increase in interest rates: and the risk of mismatch between the expected duration of certain annuity liabilities and prepayment risk and extension risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities.
Jackson enters into financial derivative transactions, including swaps, forwards, put-swaptions, futures and options to reduce and manage business risks.
These transactions manage the risk of a change in the value, yield, price, cash flows, or quantity of, or a degree of exposure with respect to assets, liabilities or future cash flows, which Jackson has acquired or incurred.
Jackson generally uses free-standing derivative instruments for hedging purposes.
Additionally, certain liabilities, primarily trust instruments supported by funding agreements, fixed indexed annuities, certain GMWB variable annuity features and reinsured GMIB variable annuity features contain embedded derivatives as defined by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Jackson does not account for such derivatives as either fair value or cash flow hedges as might be permitted if the specific hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were followed.
Financial derivatives, including derivatives embedded in certain host liabilities that have been separated for accounting and financial reporting purposes are carried at fair value.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 155 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D3: US operations continued Value movements on the derivatives are reported within the income statement.
Under the Groups accounting policies supplementary analysis of the profit before taxes attributable to shareholders is provided as shown in note B1.
In preparing this analysis, value movements on Jackson derivative contracts, other than for certain equity-based product management activities, are included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns and excluded from operating results based on longer-term investment returns.
Value A movements on derivative instruments used for certain equity-based product management activities are included within operating results based on longer-term investment returns, as the value movements broadly offset the economic impact of changed levels of benefit payments and reserves as equity markets fluctuate.
The types of derivative used by Jackson and their purpose are as follows: interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange B of the underlying principal amount.
These agreements are used for hedging purposes: forwards consist of interest spreadlock agreements, in which Jackson locks in the forward interest rate differential between a swap and the corresponding US Treasury security.
The forwards are held as a hedge of corporate spreads: C put-swaption contracts provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to require the writer to pay the present value of a long-duration interest rate swap at future exercise dates.
Jackson purchases and writes put-swaptions with maturities up to 10 years.
On a net basis, put-swaptions hedge against significant upward movements in interest rates: equity index futures contracts and equity index call and put options are used to hedge Jacksons obligations associated with its issuance D of fixed indexed immediate and deferred annuities and certain VA guarantees.
These annuities and guarantees contain embedded options which are fair valued for financial reporting purposes: total return swaps in which Jackson receives equity returns or returns based on reference pools of assets in exchange for short-term floating rate payments based on notional amounts, are held for both hedging and investment purposes: and E cross-currency swaps, which embody spot and forward currency swaps and additionally, in some cases, interest rate swaps and equity index swaps, are entered into for the purpose of hedging Jacksons foreign currency denominated funding agreements supporting trust instrument obligations.
As noted above, Jackson is exposed to equity risk through the options embedded in the fixed indexed liabilities and GMDB and GMWB F guarantees included in certain VA benefits.
This risk is managed using a comprehensive equity hedging programme to minimise the risk of a significant economic impact as a result of increases or decreases in equity market levels while taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures in Jacksons operations.
Jackson purchases external futures and options that hedge the risks inherent in these products, while also considering the impact of rising and falling separate account fees.
As a result of this hedging programme, if the equity markets were to increase, Jacksons free-standing derivatives would decrease in value.
However, over time, this movement would be broadly offset by G increased separate account fees and reserve decreases, net of the related changes to amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
Due to the nature of the free-standing and embedded derivatives, this hedge, while highly effective on an economic basis, may not completely mute the immediate impact of the market movements as the free-standing derivatives reset immediately while the hedged liabilities reset more slowly see note d for further details on the valuation of the guarantees and fees are recognised prospectively.
It is estimated that an immediate increase in the equity markets of 10 per cent would result in a net accounting charge of up to 20 million, excluding the H impact on future separate account fees.
The actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon the volume of new product sales and lapses, changes to the derivative portfolio, correlation of market returns and various other factors including volatility, interest rates and elapsed time.
For risk management purposes, the US general account portfolio is divided substantially into assets that support the interest-sensitive I life and fixed annuity business, the institutional business and the fixed indexed business.
Jackson hedges the equity return risk on fixed indexed products by purchasing futures and options on the relevant index.
Information on credit risk of debt securities and mortgage-backed securities For statutory reporting in the US, debt securities are classified into six quality categories specified by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC.
The categories range from Class 1 the highest to Class 6 the lowest.
Performing securities are designated as Classes 1 to 5.
Securities in or near default are designated Class 6.
Securities designated as Class 3, 4, 5 and 6 are non-investment grade securities.
Generally, securities rated AAA to A by nationally recognised statistical ratings organisations are reflected in Class 1, BBB in Class 2, BB in Class 3 and B and below in Classes 4 to 6.
If a designation is not currently available from the NAIC, Jacksons investment advisor, PPM America, provides the designation for the purposes of disclosure below.

Accordingly, and consistent with the basis explained in note A4, in the case of Jackson the carrying values of insurance assets and liabilities are consolidated into the Group A accounts based on US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, investment contracts as defined for US GAAP purposes are accounted for by applying in the first instance a retrospective deposit method to determine the liability for policyholder benefits.
This is then augmented by potentially three additional amounts.
These amounts are for: B any amounts that have been assessed to compensate the insurer for services to be performed over future periods i. e. deferred income : any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract: and any probable future loss on the contract i. e. premium deficiency.
C Capitalised acquisition costs and deferred income for these contracts are amortised over the life of the book of contracts.
The present value of the estimated gross profits is generally computed using the rate of interest that accrues to policyholder balances sometimes referred to as the contract rate.
Estimated gross profits include estimates of the following elements, each of which will be determined based on the best estimate of amounts of the following individual elements over the life of the book of contracts without provision for D adverse deviation for: amounts expected to be assessed for mortality less benefit claims in excess of related policyholder balances: amounts expected to be assessed for contract administration less costs incurred for contract administration: E amounts expected to be earned from the investment of policyholder balances less interest credited to policyholder balances: amounts expected to be assessed against policyholder balances upon termination of contracts sometimes referred to as surrender charges : and other expected assessments and credits.
F VA contracts written by Jackson may, as described above, provide for GMDB, GMIB and GMWB features.
In general terms, liabilities for these benefits are accounted for under US GAAP by using estimates of future benefits and fees under best estimate persistency assumptions.
The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account G balance and recognising the excess rateably over the life of the contract based on total expected assessments.
At 31 December 2006, the GMDB liability was valued using a series of deterministic investment performance scenarios, a mean investment return of 8.4 per cent 2005: 8.4 per cent and assumptions for lapse, mortality and expense that are the same as those used in amortising the capitalised acquisition costs.
The direct GMIB liability is determined by estimating the expected value of the annuitisation benefits in excess of the projected account H balance at the date of annuitisation and recognising the excess rateably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments.
The assumptions used for calculating the direct GMIB liability at 31 December 2006 and 2005 are consistent with those used for calculating the GMDB liability.
I Jackson regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional GMDB and GMIB liability balances, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
GMIB benefits are essentially fully reinsured, subject to annual claim limits.
As this reinsurance benefit is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39 and is, therefore, recognised at fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of short-term derivative fluctuations.
Most GMWB features are considered to be embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Therefore, provisions for these benefits are recognised at fair value, with the change in fair value included in operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
Certain GMWB features guarantee payments over a lifetime and, therefore, include mortality risk.
Provisions for these GMWB amounts are valued consistent with the GMDB valuation method discussed above.
158 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D3: US operations continued The fair values of the GMWB and GMIB reinsurance derivatives are calculated based on actuarial assumptions related to the projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract charges, over the expected lives of the contracts, incorporating expectations regarding policyholder behaviour in varying economic conditions.
As the nature of these cash flows can be quite varied, stochastic techniques are used to generate a variety of market return scenarios for evaluation.
The generation of these scenarios and the assumptions as to A policyholder behaviour involve numerous estimates and subjective judgements, including those regarding expected market volatility, correlations of market returns and discount rates, utilisation of the benefit by policyholders under varying conditions, and policyholder lapsation.
At each valuation date, Jackson assumes expected returns based on risk-free rates as represented by the LIBOR forward curve rates as of that date and market volatility as determined with reference to implied volatility data and evaluations of historical volatilities for B various indices.
The risk-free spot rates as represented by the LIBOR spot curve as of the valuation date are used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic process.
With the exception of the GMDB, GMIB and GMWB features of VA contracts, the financial guarantee features of Jacksons contracts are in most circumstances not explicitly valued, but the impact of any interest guarantees would be reflected as they are earned in the current account value i. e. the US GAAP liability.
C For traditional life insurance contracts, provisions for future policy benefits are determined under US GAAP standards SFAS 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises using the net level premium method and assumptions as of the issue date as to mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses plus provisions for adverse deviation.
D Institutional products are accounted for as investment contracts under IFRS with the liability classified as being in respect of financial instruments rather than insurance contracts, as defined by IFRS 4.
In practice, there is no material difference between the IFRS and US GAAP basis of recognition and measurement for these contracts.
Certain institutional products representing obligations issued in currencies other than US dollars have been hedged for changes in E exchange rates using cross-currency swaps.
The fair value of derivatives embedded in funding agreements, as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, are included in the carrying value of the trust instruments supported by funding agreements.
e Reinsurance The principal reinsurance ceded by Jackson outside the Group is on term life insurance, direct and assumed accident and health business F and GMIB variable annuity guarantees.
In 2006, the premiums for such ceded business amounted to 66 million 2005: 78 million.
Net commissions received on ceded business and claims incurred ceded to external reinsurers totalled 12 million and 53 million, respectively, during 2006 2005: 13 million and 54 million respectively.
There were no deferred gains or losses on reinsurance contracts in either 2006 or 2005.
The reinsurance asset for business ceded outside the Group was 427 million 2005: 520 million.
f Effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities G 2006 The operating profit based on longer-term investment returns of 408 million for US operations for 2006 has been determined after taking account of several changes of assumptions during the year.
Generally, assumptions were modified in 2006 to conform to more recent experience.
These changes included revisions to the assumptions regarding utilisation of free partial withdrawal options, resulting in a H decrease in Deferred Acquisition Costs DAC of 12 million.
In addition, several smaller changes relating to lapse rates, mortality rates and other assumptions, resulted in an increase of 6 million in DAC.
Combined with other minor modifications, the resulting net impact of all changes during the year was a decrease in pre-tax profits of 7 million.
2005 I The operating profit based on longer-term investment returns of 362 million for US operations for 2005 has been determined after taking account of material changes of assumptions during the year.
Several assumptions were modified in 2005 to conform to more recent experience.
The most significant changes included a DAC write-down of 21 million for single premium deferred annuities partial withdrawal changes and a Universal Life SOP 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Non-traditional Long Duration Contracts and Separate Accounts reserve increase of 13 million due to increasing the mortality assumption.
Several smaller changes relating to single premium whole life surrenders and annuity mortality and annuitisation rates, resulted in a 19 million benefit on adjusting amortisation of DAC.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 159 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D3: US operations continued g Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts At 31 December 2006, the EEV basis value of in-force business of the US operations, after taking account of the cost of encumbered capital, and the cost of the time value of financial options and guarantees, was 1,320 million 2005: 1,251 million.
This value has been determined after applying the principles of valuation described in note D1.
The key assumptions in these projections are the risk discount A rates, which are 8.4 per cent 2005: 8.0 per cent for variable annuity business and 5.6 per cent 2005: 5.2 per cent for other business, and the expected ultimate spread between the earned rate and the rate credited to policyholders for single premium deferred annuity business of 1.75 per cent.
The sensitivity of the value of in-force business and net worth to changes in key assumptions is as follows: B 2006 2005 m m Economic assumptions: Discount rates 1% increase 127 133 Interest rates including consequential changes for assumed investment returns for all asset classes, C market values of debt securities and all risk discount rates : 1% increase 190 144 1% decrease 116 55 Equity Property yields 1% rise 46 42 D Equity Property market values 10% fall 58 55 Non-economic assumptions: Maintenance expenses 10% decrease 32 36 Lapse rates 10% decrease 110 90 Mortality and morbidity 5% decrease in base rates i. e. increased longevity 75 90 E Notes 2005 comparatives have been adjusted to reflect the effect of equity falls where the impact of associated hedging activity on variable annuity business is now included.
h Sensitivity of IFRS basis profit and equity to changes that have a material effect i Currency fluctuations F Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Groups US operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
A 10 per cent increase in these rates would reduce reported profit before tax attributable to shareholders and shareholders equity attributable to US insurance operations by 42 million 2005: 48 million and 247 million 2005: 270 million respectively.
G ii Other sensitivities The principal determinants of variations in operating profit based on longer-term returns are: growth in the size of assets under management covering the liabilities for the contracts in force: and H spread returns for the difference between investment returns and rates credited to policyholders.
For the purpose of determining longer-term returns, adjustment is necessary for the normalisation of investment returns to remove the effects of short-term volatility in investment returns.
amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
I For term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums.
For annuity business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For interest-sensitive business, the key assumption is the expected long-term spread between the earned rate and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual experience is measured by internally developed mortality and persistency studies.
For variable annuity business, the key assumption is the expected long-term level of equity market returns, which for 2006 and 2005 was 8.4 per cent per annum implemented using a mean reversion methodology.
These returns affect the level of future expected profits through their effects on the fee income and the required level of provision for guaranteed minimum death benefit claims.
160 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D3: US operations continued variations in fees and other income, offset by variations in market value adjustment payments and, where necessary, strengthening of liabilities.
Except to the extent of mortality experience, which primarily affects profits through variations in claim payments and GMDB reserves, the A profits of Jackson are relatively insensitive to changes in insurance risk.
iii Exposure to interest rate risk Notwithstanding the market risk exposure described in note D3 c, except in the circumstances of interest rate scenarios where the guarantee rates included in contract terms are higher than crediting rates that can be supported from assets held to cover liabilities, the B accounting measurement of liabilities of Jackson products is not generally sensitive to interest rate risk.
This position derives from the nature of the products and the US GAAP basis of measurement described in notes D3 b and D3 d. i Duration of liabilities The Group uses cash flow projections of expected benefit payments as part of the determination of the value of in-force business when preparing EEV basis results.
The maturity profile of the cash flows used for that purpose for 2006 and 2005 is as follows: C 2006 2005 note i Fixed Fixed annuity and annuity and other other business usiness D including including GICs and GICs and similar Variable similar Variable contracts annuity contracts annuity m m m m Policyholder liabilities 20,379 11,367 23,407 8,574 E %% %% Expected maturity: 0 to 5 years 53 48 52 47 5 to 10 years 26 30 26 31 F 10 to 15 years 11 13 12 13 15 to 20 years 56 66 20 to 25 years 32 32 Over 25 years 21 11 G Note i The presentation of the 2005 maturity profile has been altered to a discounted basis from the previously published undiscounted basis to conform to the current years presentation.

C b Products and guarantees The life insurance products offered by the Groups Asian operations include a range of with-profits and non-participating term, whole life, endowment and unit-linked policies.
The Asian operations also offer health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage to supplement its core life products.
D The terms and conditions of the contracts written by the Asian operations and, in particular, the products options and guarantees, vary from territory to territory depending upon local market circumstances.
In general terms, the Asian participating products provide savings and protection where the basic sum assured can be enhanced by a profit share or bonus from the underlying fund as determined at the discretion of the insurers.
The Asian operations non-participating E term, whole life and endowment products offer savings and or protection where the benefits are guaranteed or determined by a set of defined market related parameters.
Unit-linked products combine savings with protection, the cash value of the policy depends on the value of the underlying unitised funds.
Accident and Health A&H policies provide mortality or morbidity benefits and include health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage.
A&H products are commonly offered as supplements to main life policies but can be sold separately.
F Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described in note D2 b in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts written in the Hong Kong branch, Singapore and Malaysia.
Participating products have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements.
G Non-participating long-term products are the only ones where the insurer is contractually obliged to provide guarantees on all benefits.
Investment-linked products have the lowest level of guarantee if indeed they have any.
Product guarantees in Asia can be broadly classified into four main categories: namely premium rate, cash value and interest rate guarantees, policy renewability and convertibility options.
H The risks on death coverage through premium rate guarantees are low due to appropriate product pricing.
Cash value and interest rate guarantees are of three types: Maturity values Maturity values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
Declared annual I bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Future bonus rates and cash dividends are not guaranteed on participating products.
Surrender values Surrender values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
The surrender value of declared reversionary bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Market value adjustments and surrender penalties are used where the law permits such adjustments in cash values.
Interest rate guarantees It is common in Asia for regulations or market driven demand and competition to provide some form of capital value protection and minimum crediting interest rate guarantees.
This would be reflected within the guaranteed maturity and surrender values.
The guarantees are borne by shareholders for non-participating and investment-linked non-investment guarantees only products.
Participating product guarantees are predominantly supported by the segregated life funds and their estates.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 163 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D4: Asian operations continued The most significant book of non-participating business in the Asian operations is Taiwans whole of life contracts.
For these contracts there are floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception which are set by reference to minimum terms established by local regulation also at the time of inception.
These rates do not vary subsequently with market conditions.
A Under these contracts, the cost of premiums are also fixed at inception based on a number of assumptions at that time, including longterm interest rates, mortality assumptions and expenses.
The guaranteed maturity and surrender values reflect the pricing basis.
The main variable that determines the amounts payable under the contracts is the duration of the contracts, which is determined by death or surrender.
The sensitivity of the IFRS result for these contracts is shown in note h below.
B Whole of life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception are also written in the Korean life operations, though to a much less significant extent than in Taiwan.
The Korean business has non-linked liabilities and linked liabilities at 31 December 2006 of 226 million and 316 million respectively 2005: 193 million and 91 million respectively.
The business is much less sensitive to returns than Taiwan with the higher proportion of linked and health business.
C The other area of note in respect of guarantees is the Japanese business where pricing rates are higher than current bond yields.
Lapse risk is a feature in that policyholders could potentially surrender their policies on guaranteed terms if interest rates significantly increased leaving the potential for losses if bond values had depreciated significantly.
However, the business is matched to a relatively short realistic liability duration.
D The method for determining liabilities of insurance contracts for UK GAAP, and hence IFRS, purposes for some Asian operations is based on US GAAP principles and this method applies to contracts with cash value and interest rate guarantees.
Following standard US GAAP procedure, premium deficiency reserve calculations are performed each year to establish whether the carrying values of the liabilities are insufficient.
On the US GAAP basis the calculations are deterministic, that is to say based off a single set of projections, and expected long-term rates E of return are applied.
c Exposure to market risk The Asian operations sell with-profits and unit-linked policies and, although the with-profits business generally has a lower terminal bonus element than in the UK, the investment portfolio still contains a proportion of equities and, to a lesser extent, property.
Non-participating F business is largely backed by debt securities or deposits.
With the principal exception of Taiwans whole of life policy book, as described in note h below, the exposure to market risk of the Group arising from its Asian operations is at modest levels.
This arises from the fact that the Asian operations have a balanced portfolio of with-profits, unit-linked and other types of business.
d Process for setting assumptions and determining liabilities G The future policyholder benefit provisions for Asian businesses in the Groups IFRS accounts and previously under the MSB, are determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with UK GAAP.
For Asian operations in countries where local GAAP is not well established and in which the business written is primarily non-participating and linked business, US GAAP is used as the most appropriate reporting basis.
Of the more significant Asian operations, this basis is H applied in Taiwan, Japan and Vietnam.
The future policyholder benefit provisions for non-linked business are determined under FAS 60 using the net level premium method, with an allowance for surrenders, maintenance and claims expenses.
Rates of interest used in establishing the policyholder benefit provisions vary by operation depending on the circumstances attaching to each block of business.
For the traditional business in Taiwan, the economic scenarios used to calculate the IFRS results reflect the assumption of a phased I progression of bond yields from current rates to long-term expected rates.
The projections assume that the current bond yields of around two per cent 2005: two per cent trend towards 5.5 per cent 2005: 5.5 per cent at 31 December 2013 2005: 2012. e Reinsurance The Asian businesses cede only minor amounts of business outside the Group with immaterial effects on reported profit.
During 2006, reinsurance premiums for externally ceded business were 47 million 2005: 37 million and the reinsurance assets were 8 million 2005: 8 million in aggregate.
f Effect of changes in bases and assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities 2006 There are no changes of assumptions that had a material impact on the 2006 results of Asian operations.
164 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D4: Asian operations continued 2005 The 2005 results for Asian operations are affected in two significant ways for changes of basis or assumption.
For the Singapore life business, under the basis applied previously for 2004 and earlier, liabilities of non-participating business were A determined on a net premium basis using prescribed interest rates such that a very high degree of prudence resulted.
This basis has been replaced under the Singapore risk-based capital framework, with one that, although still including provisions for adverse deviation, more accurately estimates the liability.
This resulted in a change of estimate and reduction in the liability of 73 million.
The second item reflects the application of liability adequacy testing for the Taiwan life business which has resulted in a write-off of B deferred acquisition costs of 21 million in 2005.
The assumptions for future investment returns for Taiwan are described in note d above.
The loss reflects the reduction in 2005 in the expected yields over the trending period to the assumed long-term rate of 5.5 per cent for Taiwanese government bonds.
Consistent with the application of US GAAP for Taiwanese insurance contracts under IFRS 4, this write-off resulted from a premium deficiency as defined under paragraphs 35-37 of SFAS 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises SFAS 60, and a resulting C unlocking of actuarial assumptions in accordance with paragraph 21 of SFAS 60.
Under the standard liability adequacy testing required by SFAS 60, the net amount for the present value of future payments for benefits and claims less present value of future premiums, determined using revised assumptions based on actual and anticipated experience, i. e. the best estimate amount, has been compared against the balance sheet liability for policy benefits less unamortised acquisition costs.
D There were no other changes of assumptions that had a material impact on the 2005 results of Asian operations.
g Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows from insurance contracts At 31 December 2006, the EEV basis value of in-force business of the Asian operations, after taking account of the cost of encumbered E capital and the cost of the time value of financial options and guarantees was 1,628 million 2005: 1,226 million.
The most significant businesses in Asia are in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.
These businesses account for 75 per cent 2005: 77 per cent of the total value of business in force for the Asian operations.
These EEV basis in-force values have been determined after applying the principles of valuation described in section D1 and the following key assumptions for the four most significant businesses.
2006 2005 F Risk Risk discount Expected discount Expected rate long-term rate long-term in-force rate of Government in-force rate of Government business inflation bond yield business inflation bond yield %%% %%% G Hong Kong 6.8 2.25 4.7 6.15 2.25 4.8 Malaysia 9.2 3.0 7.0 9.0 3.0 7.0 Singapore 6.9 1.75 4.5 6.8 1.75 4.5 Taiwan 9.3 2.25 5.5 9.4 2.25 5.5 H Hong Kong business is predominantly US dollar denominated.
Cash rates are used in setting the risk discount rates.
The most significant equity holdings in Asian operations are in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
The arithmetic average equity return assumptions for these three territories at 31 December 2006 were 8.7 per cent, 9.3 per cent and 12.8 per cent respectively 2005: 8.6 per I cent, 9.3 per cent and 12.8 per cent respectively.
For Taiwan the same assumptions are applied as under IFRS see note d above.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 165 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D4: Asian operations continued The sensitivity of the value of in-force business and net worth to changes in key assumptions is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Economic assumptions: A Discount rates 1% increase 271 236 Interest rates including consequential changes for assumed investment returns for all assets classes, market values of debt securities and all risk discount rates : 1% increase 42 49 1% decrease 115 126 B Equity Property yields 1% rise 154 136 Equity Property market values 10% fall 99 75 Non-economic assumptions: Maintenance expenses 10% decrease 45 45 C Lapse rates 10% decrease 93 87 Mortality and morbidity 5% decrease in base rates i. e. increased longevity 77 69 In addition to these disclosures, for Asian operations as a whole it should be noted that the cash flows of the Taiwan life business are particularly sensitive to projected rates of investment return as described in note h ii below.
D h Sensitivity of IFRS basis profit and equity to changes that have a material effect i Currency translation Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Asian operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
For 2006, the rates for the most significant operations are given in note I9.
E A 10 per cent increase in these rates and those of other Asian operations would have reduced reported profit before tax attributable to shareholders and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill attributable to Asian operations, by 33 million 2005: 23 million and 116 million 2005: 101 million respectively.
ii Other sensitivities F With-profits business Similar principles to those explained for UK with-profits business apply to profit emergence for the Asian with-profits business.
Correspondingly, the profit emergence reflects bonus declaration and is relatively insensitive to period by period fluctuations in insurance risk or interest rate movements.
G Unit-linked business As for the UK insurance operations, the profits and shareholders equity related to the Asian operations is primarily driven by charges related to invested funds.
For the Asian operations, substantially all of the contracts are classified as insurance contracts under IFRS 4, i. e. containing significant insurance risk.
The sensitivity of profits and equity to changes in insurance risk is minor and, to interest rate risk, not material.
H Other non-participating business The principal other non-participating business of Asian operations is the traditional whole of life business written in Taiwan.
The in-force business of the Taiwan life operation includes traditional whole of life policies where the premium rates have been set by the I regulator at different points for the industry as a whole.
Premium rates were set to give a guaranteed minimum sum assured on death and a guaranteed surrender value on early surrender based on prevailing interest rates at the time of policy issue.
Premium rates also included allowance for mortality and expenses.
The required rates of guarantee have fallen over time as interest rates have reduced from a high of eight per cent to current levels of around two per cent.
The current low level of bond rates in Taiwan gives rise to a negative spread against the majority of these policies.
The current cash cost of funding in-force negative spread in Taiwan is around 40 million a year.
The profits attaching to these contracts are particularly affected by the rates of return earned, and estimated to be earned, on the assets held to cover liabilities and on future investment income and contract cash flows.
Under IFRS, the insurance contract liabilities of the Taiwan business are determined on the US GAAP basis as applied previously under UK GAAP.
Under this basis, the policy liabilities are calculated on sets of assumptions, which are locked in at the point of policy inception, and a deferred acquisition cost is held in the balance sheet.
The adequacy of the insurance contract liabilities is tested by reference to best estimates of expected investment returns on policy cash flows and reinvested income.
The assumed earned rates are used to discount the future cash flows.
The assumed earned rates consist of a long-term best estimate determined by consideration of long-term market conditions and rates assumed to be earned in the trending period.
For 2005, it was projected that rates of return for Taiwanese bond yields would trend from the then current levels of some two per cent to 5.5 per cent by 31 December 2012.
For 2006, it has been assumed that the long-term bond rate will be attained one year later, i. e. by 31 December 2013.
166 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D4: Asian operations continued The liability adequacy test results are sensitive to the attainment of the trended rates during the trending period.
Based on the current asset mix, margins in other contracts that are used in the assessment of the liability adequacy tests and currently assumed future rates of return, if interest rates were to remain at current levels in 2007 and the target date for attainment of the long-term bond yield deferred to 31 December 2014, the premium reserve, net of deferred acquisition costs, would be broadly sufficient.
If interest rates were to remain A at current levels in 2008 with a further one year delay in the progression period, then some level of write-off of deferred acquisition costs may be necessary.
However, the amount of the charge based on current in-force business, which is estimated at 70-90 million, is sensitive to the previously mentioned variables.
Furthermore, the actual amount of any write-off would be affected by the impact of new business written between 31 December 2006 B and the future reporting dates to the extent that the business is taken into account as part of the liability adequacy testing calculations for the portfolio of contracts.
The adequacy of the liability is also sensitive to the level of the projected long-term rate.
The current long-term assumption of 5.5 per cent has been determined on a prudent best estimate basis by reference to detailed assessments of the financial dynamics of the Taiwanese C economy.
In the event that the rate applied was altered, the carrying value of the deferred acquisition costs and policyholder liabilities would potentially be affected.
At 31 December 2006, if the assumed long-term bond yield applied had been reduced by 0.5 per cent from 5.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent and continued to apply the same progression period to 31 December 2013, by assuming bond yields increase from current levels in equal D annual instalments to the long-term rate, the premium reserve, net of deferred acquisition costs, would have been insufficient and there would have been a charge of some 60 million to the income statement.
The impact of reducing the long-term rate by a further 0.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent would have increased this charge by some 160 million.
The primary reason for the lower level of charge for the initial 0.5 per cent reduction is the current level of margins in the liability adequacy calculation.
The effects of additional 0.5 per cent reductions in the assumed long-term rate below 4.5 per cent would be of a similar or slightly higher level to the 160 million noted previously.
The E effects of changes in any one year reflect the combination of the short-term and long-term factors described above.
For the Korean and Japanese life business exposures described in note b above, the results are comparatively unaffected by changes of assumption.
The accounts basis value of liabilities for both operations are of a similar order of magnitude to those that apply for the purposes of Group solvency calculations under the Financial Conglomerates Directive FCD.
F i Duration of liabilities The Group uses cash flow projections of expected benefit payments as part of the determination of the value of in-force business when preparing EEV basis results.
The maturity profile of the cash flows, taking account of expected future premiums and investment returns, is as follows: G 2006 2005 m m Policyholder liabilities 12,801 10,828 % % H Expected maturity: 0 to 5 years 22 23 5 to 10 years 20 25 10 to 15 years 16 19 I 15 to 20 years 13 12 20 to 25 years 10 8 Over 25 years 19 13 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 167 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D5: Capital position statement for life assurance businesses a Summary statement The Groups capital position for life assurance businesses with reconciliations to shareholders equity is shown below.

Policyholder liabilities of the Hong Kong branch are included in the amounts of Asian life assurance subsidiaries.
ii Excluding PAC shareholders funds that are included in parent company and shareholders equity of other subsidiaries and funds.
iii The term shareholders equity held in long-term funds refers to the excess of assets over liabilities attributable to shareholders of funds which are required by law to be maintained with segregated assets and liabilities.
H iv For regulatory purposes the Jackson surplus notes are accounted for as capital.
v Other adjustments to shareholders equity and unallocated surplus include amounts for the value of non-participating business for UK regulated with-profits funds, deferred tax, admissibility and other items measured differently on the regulatory basis.
For Jackson the principal reconciling item is deferred tax related to deferred acquisition costs of 599 million 2005: 568 million.
I vi Insurance business accounted for as financial instruments under IAS 39. vii In determining the IAS 19 adjustment for the purposes of this table the surplus deficit in the Groups main pension scheme used for the calculation includes amounts for investments in Prudential insurance policies see note I1.
b Basis of preparation, capital requirements and management Each of the Groups long-term business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
Details by the Groups major operations are shown below.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 171 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D5: Capital position statement for life assurance businesses continued i UK insurance operations PAC WPSF and SAIF In common with other large UK regulated with-profits funds, PAC is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU directives i. e. the regulatory peak and the new FSA basis calculation of expected liabilities i. e. the A realistic peak.
Available capital of the WPSF and SAIF of 8.7 billion 2005: 8.0 billion represents the excess of assets over liabilities on the FSA realistic basis.
Unlike the previously discussed FRS 27 basis, realistic liabilities on the regulatory basis include the shareholders share of future bonuses.
These amounts are shown before deduction of the risk capital margin RCM which is estimated to be 1.9 billion 2005: B 2.4 billion at 31 December 2006.
The FSAs basis of setting the RCM is to target a level broadly equivalent to a Standard & Poors credit rating of BBB and to judge this by ensuring there are sufficient assets to absorb a 1 in 200 year event.
The RCM calculation achieves this by setting rules for the determination of margins to cover defined stress changes in asset values and yields for market risk, credit risk and termination risk for C with-profits policies.
As noted in section D2 d ii, PAC has discretion in its management actions in the case of adverse investment conditions.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to, investment allocation decisions, levels of reversionary bonuses, crediting rates and total claim values.
To illustrate the flexibility of management actions, rates of regular bonus are determined for each type of policy primarily by D targeting them at a prudent proportion of the long-term expected future investment return on the underlying assets.
The expected future investment return is reduced as appropriate for each type of policy to allow for items such as expenses, charges, tax and shareholders transfers.
However, the rates declared may differ by product type, or by date of payment of the premiums or date of issue of the policy, if the accumulated annual bonuses are particularly high or low relative to a prudent proportion of the achieved investment return.
E When target bonus levels change, the PAC board has regard to the overall financial strength of the long-term fund when determining the length of time over which it will seek to achieve the amended product target bonus level.
In normal investment conditions, PAC expects changes to regular bonus rates to be gradual over time and changes are not expected to exceed one per cent per annum over any year.
However, discretion is retained as to whether or not a regular bonus is declared each year, F and there is no limit on the amount by which regular bonus rates can be changed.
As regards smoothing of maturity and death benefits, in normal circumstances PAC does not expect most pay-out values on policies of the same duration to change by more than 10 per cent up or down from one year to the next, although some larger changes may occur to balance pay-out values between different policies.
Greater flexibility may be required in certain circumstances, for example following a G significant rise or fall in market values either sudden or over a period of years and in such situations the PAC board may decide to vary the standard bonus smoothing limits to protect the overall interests of policyholders.
For surrender benefits, any substantial fall in the market value of the assets of the with-profits sub-fund would lead to immediate changes in the application of MVRs for accumulating with-profits policies, firstly to increase the size of MVRs already being applied and, secondly, to extend the range of policies for which an MVR is applied.
H Other UK life assurance subsidiaries and funds The available capital of 903 million 2005: 759 million reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities of the subsidiaries and funds, before deduction of the capital resources requirement of 809 million 2005: 718 million.
I The capital resources requirement for these companies broadly reflects a formula which, for active funds, equates to a percentage of regulatory reserves plus a percentage of death strains.
ii Jackson The regulatory framework for Jackson is governed by the requirements of the US NAIC approved risk-based capital standards.
Under the requirements life insurance companies report on a formula-based capital standard that they calculate by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items.
The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of a company, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk.
The available capital of Jackson shown above of 2,083 million 2005: 2,257 million reflects US regulatory basis assets less liabilities excluding asset valuation reserves.
The asset valuation reserve is designed to provide for future credit-related losses on debt securities and losses on equity investments.
Available capital includes the effect of the interest maintenance reserve, which is designed by state regulators to defer recognition of non-credit related realised capital gains and losses and to recognise them rateably in the future.
Jacksons risk-based capital ratio is significantly in excess of regulatory requirements.
172 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D5: Capital position statement for life assurance businesses continued iii Asian operations The available capital shown above of 566 million 2005: 570 million represents the excess of local regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of required capital of 211 million 2005: 149 million.
These amounts have been determined applying the local regulations in each of the operations.
A At the country level, the businesses in Asia are subject to schemes in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
The Hong Kong business branch of PAC and its capital requirements are subsumed within those of the PAC long-term fund.
For the other material Asian operations, the details of the basis of determining regulatory capital and regulatory capital requirements are as follows: B Singapore A new risk-based regulatory framework was introduced at the start of 2005 to replace the previous framework that used a net premium approach.
For participating business, a gross premium reserve, determined using prudent best estimate assumptions and which makes allowance for future bonus, is held.
The amount held is subject to a minimum of the higher of the assets attributed to participating business and a C gross premium reserve calculated on specified assumptions, but without allowance for future bonus, that include prescribed provisions for adverse deviations PADs.
For non-participating business, gross premium reserves are held.
For linked business the value of units is held together with a non-unit reserve calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
D From 1 January 2005, capital requirements are determined using a risk-based capital approach.
Taiwan Basic policy reserves are determined using a net premium method.
Both mortality and interest rates are specified.
For more recent issues, E the valuation rate of interest has been linked to the prevailing market rate on 10-year government bonds.
Solvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach.
Japan Mathematical reserves for traditional business are determined on a net premium basis using prescribed mortality and interest rates.
F Interest rates reflect the original pricing assumptions.
With regard to solvency, the adjusted solvency capital assets of the Company must exceed 200 per cent of the risk related capital requirement value at risk.
It is thus a risk-based capital approach.
G Malaysia Mathematical reserves for traditional business are determined on a modified net premium basis using prescribed mortality and interest rates no higher than four per cent.
H For linked business the value of units is held together with a non-unit reserve calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
The capital requirement is determined as four per cent of reserves plus a specified percentage of sums at risk.
There is an overriding minimum capital requirement of 100 million Malaysian Ringgits.
iv Group capital requirements I In addition to the requirements at individual company level, FSA requirements under the FCD apply additional prudential requirements for the Group as a whole.
Discussion of the Groups estimated FCD position at 31 December 2006 is provided in the operating and financial review section of the Groups 2006 Annual Report.
c Movements in total available capital Total available capital for the Groups life assurance operations has changed during 2006 as follows: Other UK subsidiaries Asian life WPSF SAIF and funds Jackson assurance Group note i note ii note iv note iii subsidiaries total m m m m m m Available capital at 31 December 2005 7,979 759 2,257 570 11,565 Changes in assumptions 61 3 2 56 Changes in management policy Changes in regulatory requirements 80 80 New business and other factors 648 67 174 2 539 Available capital at 31 December 2006 8,688 903 2,083 566 12,240 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 173 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued D5: Capital position statement for life assurance businesses continued Detail on the movement for 2005 is as follows: 2005 m Available capital at 31 December 2004 9,006 A Changes: WPSF note i 2,615 SAIF note ii 677 Jackson note iii 461 Other 160 B 2,559 Available capital at 31 December 2005 11,565 Notes i WPSF C The 648 million increase in available capital in 2006 for new business and other factors incorporates the effects of the strong investment returns in 2006 and the improved outlook for future investment returns.
The increase in available capital in 2005, shown in the format as previously published, arises as follows: 2005 m D Investment return, net of tax and investment management expenses 1,329 Decrease in inadmissible assets 309 Decrease in cost of guarantees 547 Decrease in cost of bonus smoothing 195 Increase in the value of PAL and non-profit business 212 Other 23 E 2,615 ii SAIF The decrease of 677 million in 2005 reflects the impact of FSA actuarial guidance note GN 45 as explained in note D2 f. iii Jackson The decrease of 174 million in 2006 reflects an underlying increase of 100 million applying the 2006 year end exchange rate of 1.96 and 274 million of exchange translation loss.
F The increase of 461 million in 2005 reflects an underlying increase of 252 million applying the 2005 year end exchange rate of 1.72 and 209 million of exchange translation gain.
iv Other UK life assurance subsidiaries and funds The increase in available capital in 2006 from changes in regulatory requirements of 80 million is primarily due to regulatory changes for UK regulated shareholder-backed non-participating business from the FSAs policy statement PS06 14 confirmed in December 2006.
The changes allow liabilities for this business to incorporate more economic realism.
Additional details are shown in note D2.
G The effect from the changes in assumptions of valuation interest rates on insurance liabilities is broadly matched by the corresponding effect on assets leaving no significant impact on the available capital.
d Transferability of available capital For PAC and all other UK long-term insurers, long-term business assets and liabilities must, by law, be maintained in funds separate from those for the assets and liabilities attributable to non-life insurance business or to shareholders.
Only the established surplus the excess H of assets over liabilities in the long-term fund determined through a formal valuation may be transferred so as to be available for other purposes.
Distributions from the with-profits sub-fund to shareholders reflect the shareholders one-ninth share of the cost of declared policyholders bonuses.
Accordingly, the excess of assets over liabilities of the PAC long-term fund is retained within that company.
The retention of the capital I enables it to support with-profits and other business of the fund by, for example, providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees.
It also provides investment flexibility for the funds assets by meeting the regulatory capital requirements that demonstrate solvency and by absorbing the costs of significant events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting the bonus and investment policies.
For other UK long-term business subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels which provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the regulatory minimum.
For Jackson, capital retention is maintained at a level consistent with an appropriate rating by Standard & Poors.
Currently Jackson is rated AA.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, dividends which exceed the greater of 10 per cent of Jacksons statutory surplus or statutory net gain from operations for the prior year require prior regulatory approval.
174 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements D5: Capital position statement for life assurance businesses continued For Asian subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum.
For ring-fenced with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained with distribution tied to the shareholders share of bonuses through declaration of actuarially determined surplus.
The Singapore and Malaysian businesses may, in general, remit dividends to the UK, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under A local statutory regulations.
Available capital of the non-insurance business units is transferable to the life assurance businesses after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency targets, over and above basis liabilities.
The economic capital model described in section D1 concentration of risks takes into account restrictions on mobility of capital across the Group with capital transfers to and B from business units triggered at a solvency level consistent with these targets.
The model takes into account restrictions on the availability to the Group of the estate of the various with-profits funds throughout the Group.
e Sensitivity of liabilities and total capital to changed market conditions and capital management policies Prudential manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different C types of liabilities Prudential has in each business.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory requirements in which it operates, Prudential employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.
Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, Jackson and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements under D different confidence intervals and time horizons.
In addition, reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the UK, the US and Asian regulators.
A stochastic approach models the inter-relationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.
These scenarios are projected E forward over a period of time, typically 25 years or longer, and the liabilities and solvency position of the fund are calculated in each scenario in each future year.
The funds policy on management actions, including bonus and investment policy, continue to be set in order that they are consistent with the available capital and the targeted risk of default.
The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions F the approach to asset liability management.
For example, for businesses that are most sensitive to interest rate changes, such as immediate annuity business, Prudential uses cash flow analysis to create a portfolio of debt securities whose value changes in line with the value of liabilities when interest rates change.
This type of analysis helps protect profits from changing interest rates.
This type of analysis is used in the UK for annuity business and by Jackson for its interest-sensitive and fixed indexed annuities and stable value products.
G For businesses that are most sensitive to equity price changes, Prudential uses stochastic modelling and scenario testing to look at the future returns on its investments under different scenarios which best reflect the large diversity in returns that equities can produce.
This allows Prudential to devise an investment and with-profits policyholder bonus strategy that, on the model assumptions, allows it to optimise returns to its policyholders and shareholders over time while maintaining appropriate financial strength.
Prudential uses this H methodology extensively in connection with its UK with-profits business.
f Intra-group arrangements in respect of SAIF Should the assets of SAIF be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations to the policyholders of SAIF, the PAC long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency.
I Due to the quality and diversity of the assets in SAIF and the ability of SAIF to revise guaranteed benefits in the event of an asset shortfall, the directors believe that the probability of either the PAC long-term fund or the Groups shareholders funds, under their obligation to maintain the capital position of long-term funds generally, having to contribute to SAIF is remote.
