GENERAL INFORMATION Pennon Group Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 28.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors report on page 39.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors on 22 June 2006.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
a Basis of preparation These are the first financial statements to have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRS concerning the transition from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP to IFRS are set out in note 42.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC interpretations, as adopted by the European Union EU, with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and the requirements of the Financial Services Authority.
A summary of the main accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure has been adopted by the EU for implementation in 2007, but has not been adopted early in these financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best assessment of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
b First time adoption of IFRS The Groups date of transition to IFRS was 1 April 2004 and all comparative information in the financial statements has been restated to reflect the Groups adoption of IFRS, except where otherwise required or permitted by IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
All accounting policies have been consistently applied except where the Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 from the requirement to restate comparative information for IAS 32 and 39.
These Standards have been applied with effect from 1 April 2005.
IFRS 1 requires an entity to comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date for its first IFRS financial statements.
As a general principle, IFRS 1 requires the standards effective at the reporting date to be applied retrospectively.
There are, however, a number of optional exemptions from full retrospective application.
The Group has elected to take advantage of certain exemptions under IFRS 1 as follows: not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to past business combinations: to establish a deemed cost for the opening balance sheet carrying value of the water and waste water infrastructure fixed assets by reference to the fair value of these assets at the date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2004.
All non-infrastructure assets have been carried forward using the depreciated historical cost UK GAAP balances as the deemed IFRS cost: to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension schemes at the date of transition: not to apply the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to options granted under the Groups share incentive schemes prior to 7 November 2002.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued c Basis of consolidation The financial statements include the results of Pennon Group Plc and its subsidiary and joint venture undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries and joint venture undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the Group has the power to control a subsidiary.
The results of joint venture undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis where the company exercised joint control under a contractual arrangement.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture acquired are measured at their fair values and any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to profit and loss in the year of acquisition.
d Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and intercompany sales, in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
Revenue is not recognised until the service has been provided to the customer, or the goods which the sale relates to have been despatched to the customer.
Income from main water and waste water charges includes an estimation of the amount of unbilled charges at the period end based upon a defined methodology reflecting historical consumption and current tariffs.
e Landfill tax Landfill tax is included within both revenue and operating costs.
f Segmental reporting Each of the Groups business segments provide services which are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of the other business segments.
The Groups internal organisation and management structure and its system of internal financial reporting is based primarily on business segments.
The business segments comprise the regulated water and sewerage services undertaken by South West Water Limited and the waste management business of Viridor Waste Limited.
Segmental revenue, expense and results include transactions between businesses.
Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
g Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation from the acquisition of subsidiary and joint venture undertakings represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Further details are contained in accounting policy l. When a subsidiary or joint venture undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date and annually thereafter.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued h Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, with the expense taken to the income statement through operating expenses.
i Property, plant and equipment i Infrastructure assets being water mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, pipelines and sea outfalls Infrastructure assets are included at fair value on transition to IFRS and subsequent additions at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Expenditure to increase capacity or enhance infrastructure assets is capitalised where it can be reliably measured and it is probable that incremental future economic benefits will flow to the entity.
The cost of day to day servicing of infrastructure components is recognised in the income statement as it arises.
Infrastructure assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis, which are principally as follows: Dams and impounding reservoirs 200 years Water mains 40 100 years Sewers 40 100 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included within land and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes acquisition and development expenses.
The cost of a landfill is depreciated to its residual value which is linked to gas production at the site post-closure over its estimated operational life taking account of the usage of void space.
Where the obligation to restore a landfill site gives access to future economic benefits, a tangible fixed asset is recognised and depreciated based on the usage of void space.
iii Other assets including properties, over-ground plant and equipment Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated evenly over their estimated economic lives to their residual value, which are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 30 60 years Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Operational structures 40 80 years Fixed plant 20 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs which are incremental to the Group.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset an asset which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended use are capitalised as part of the asset.
Asset lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued j Grants and contributions Grants and contributions receivable in respect of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of those assets.
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of expenditure charged against profits in the year have been included in the income statement.
k Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets at their equivalent capital value and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter.
The corresponding liability is recorded as borrowings.
The interest element of the rental costs is charged against profits using the actuarial method over the period of the lease.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits in the year they are incurred.
l Impairment of assets Assets which have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets which are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Value in use represents the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash-generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects an assessment of the cost of capital of the cash-generating unit.
Impairments are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
m Joint ventures Joint ventures are entities over which the group has joint control.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the joint venture at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The carrying value of the Groups investment is adjusted for the Groups share of post-acquisition profits or losses recognised in the income statement.
Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Groups interest are not recognised unless the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to fund those losses.
n Inventories Inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials and attributable overheads.
o Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, short-term deposits held at banks and other short-term highly liquid deposits subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are shown within current borrowings.
49 NO TES T O THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued p Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group has taken advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption from application of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and has applied these standards from 1 April 2005.
Accordingly, for the 2005 comparative information, financial instruments are accounted for and presented under UK GAAP.
As a result of applying IAS 39 at 1 April 2005, net assets have been reduced by 1 million for the Groups debt interest rate swaps, by 1 million reflecting the discounted proceeds of receivables and increased by 10 million net of tax following the release of deferred income which does not qualify as a hedge under IFRS.
The Group has classified its financial instruments in the following categories from 1 April 2005. i Loans and receivables All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the net fair value of the consideration received.
Following initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are fide-recognised or impaired.
Premiums, discounts and other costs and fees are recognised in the income statement through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
ii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative instruments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently re-measured at fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement except for cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, when the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are subsequently recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
iii Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts and the impact of discounting.
iv Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued q Taxation including deferred tax Tax payable for the year is provided at current rates.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise it.
r Provisions for liabilities and charges Provisions are made where there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefits to settle this obligation and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made.
The Groups policy on provisions for specific areas is as follows: i Landfill restoration costs Provisions for the cost of restoring landfill sites are made when the obligation arises.
Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits, a tangible fixed asset is recognised.
Provisions are otherwise charged against profits.
ii Environmental control and aftercare costs Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred over the operational life of each landfill site and may be incurred for a considerable period thereafter.
Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the income statement on the basis of the usage of void space.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the current amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle obligations.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included as a financial item within interest payable and similar charges.
s Share capital and treasury shares Debt and equity instruments are identified according to their underlying factors, as required by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
Shareholders approved a 200 million return of capital, by way of a B Share Scheme and an on-market buy back programme, at the Companys Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 February 2006.
Shareholders were given the options of receiving an initial dividend payment of 110 pence for each B Share held, or redeeming the B Shares on 27 February 2006, the Initial Redemption Date, or on 6 April 2006, the Final Redemption Date, or a combination of these options.
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and B Shares as debt.
The Group balance sheet incorporates the shares held by the Pennon Employee Share Trust and which have not vested by the balance sheet date.
These are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity until such time as they vest.
t Dividend distributions Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid: final dividends when approved in general meeting by shareholders.
51 NO TES T O THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued u Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit schemes Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured using bid price.
Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are measured by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of scheme liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in other finance income or cost.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to pension plans are charged or credited to equity and recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Defined contribution schemes Costs of the defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
ii Share-based payment The Group operates a number of equity settled, share-based payment plans for employees.
The fair value of the employee services required in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
Fair values are calculated using an appropriate pricing model.
Non-market based vesting conditions are adjusted for assumptions as to the number of awards which are expected to vest.
v Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred, except where it is virtually certain that the contract will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset which is amortised to the income statement over the life of the contract.
w Fair values The fair value of the interest rate swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date if they are publicly traded.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of bank loans and other loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups treasury function seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable needs, maintains reasonable headroom for contingencies and manages interest rate risk.
Treasury operations are managed in accordance with policies established by the Board.
Major transactions are individually approved by the Board.
Treasury activities are reported to the Board and are subject to review by internal audit.
Financial instruments are used to raise finance and to manage risk.
The Group does not engage in speculative activity.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to interest rate and counterparty risk.
i Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of interest bearing liabilities at fixed rates.
At the year end 68% of net borrowings were at fixed rates.
The Group uses a combination of fixed rate borrowings and fixed rate interest swaps as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments to achieve this policy.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not, therefore, an exposure for the Group.
In addition, a 142 million finance lease was converted to an RPI-linked basis 1.365% real during the year to take advantage of historically low index-linked rates and also to reduce earnings volatility.
These instruments are analysed in more detail in note 25. ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has significant available funds for operations and planned expansions and facilities equivalent to at least one years forecast requirements are maintained at all times.
Details of undrawn committed facilities and short-term uncommitted facilities are provided in note 25. iii Refinancing risk management Refinancing risk is managed under the Group policy that no more than 20% of Group net borrowings is permitted to mature in any financial year.
iv Counterparty risk management Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
The Board has agreed a policy for managing such risk, which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals, and rigorous monitoring procedures.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.
Surplus funds of the Group are usually placed in short-term fixed interest deposits or the overnight money markets.
All deposits are with counterparties that have a credit rating threshold approved by the Board.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS The Groups principal accounting policies are set out in note 2 to these financial statements.
Management is required to exercise significant judgement and make use of estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies.
Areas which management believes require the most critical accounting judgements are: Exceptional items The Directors consider that items of income or expense which are material and non-recurring by virtue of their nature and amount should be disclosed separately if the financial statements are to fairly present the financial position and financial performance of the Group.
The Directors label these items collectively as exceptional items.
Landfill restoration and aftercare Restoration and aftercare provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the future expenditure required to settle the Groups restoration and aftercare obligations.
The discount implicit in recognising the restoration and aftercare liability is unwound over the life of the provision and is included in the profit and loss account as a financial item within the net interest charge.
Where a provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset is recognised and depreciated in accordance with the Groups depreciation policy.
For the year ended 31 March 2006 the Directors believe the appropriate accounting methodology is to record the full amount of the discounted restoration cost of landfills as a tangible fixed asset and then depreciate according to the usage of void space.
This is a change from the previous methodology of creating restoration provisions through a charge to operating cost as void space is filled.
The financial effects of this change in methodology are to create an asset with a corresponding liability as shown in notes 16 and 29 to these financial statements.
Private Finance Initiative PFI projects PFI contracts are reviewed to ascertain whether the risks and rewards of assets acquired lie substantially with the Group or the client entity.
All current contracts indicate that the most significant risks remain with the Group and therefore assets are accounted for as tangible fixed assets, with depreciation charged over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the concession period.
Joint ventures The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting as this reflects the contractual and control arrangements with the joint venture partners.
Borrowing costs The Group capitalises borrowing costs which are material and directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be prepared for their intended use.
Currently only the assets under construction in the Lakeside Energy from Waste joint venture meet the criteria for capitalisation.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit schemes plus a defined contribution section.
Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
The pension cost under IAS19 is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary based on the latest actuarial valuation and assumptions determined by the actuary.
The assumptions are based on information supplied to the actuary by the Company, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management.
The assumptions are disclosed in note 27 of the financial statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS continued Areas which management believes require the most critical accounting estimation are as follows: Landfill costs The estimation of landfill reserves is of particular importance in assessing landfill costs, since the cost of a landfill site is depreciated over its estimated operational life taking into account the usage of void space.
The Groups estimates of landfill reserves are regularly reviewed and updated during the financial year for usage and other events for example site extensions.
Estimates are also subject to physical review by external advisors.
A number of factors impact on the value of landfill reserves, including the available landfill space, future capital expenditure and operating costs.
The valuation is subject to revision as these factors change.
Carrying value of long-life assets The Groups accounting policy for tangible fixed assets is detailed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.
The carrying value of tangible fixed assets as at 31 March 2006 was 2,416 million.
In the year ended 31 March 2006 additions to tangible fixed assets totalled 250 million and the depreciation charge was 104 million.
The estimated useful economic lives of tangible fixed assets are based on managements judgement and experience.
When management identifies that actual useful lives differ materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively.
Due to the significance of tangible fixed asset investment to the Group, variations between actual and estimated useful lives could impact operating results both positively and negatively.
Historically, only minor changes to estimated useful lives have been required.
Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery.
Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.
In South West Waters case, the Group raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the Periodic Review price setting process.
For water and waste water customers with water meters, income recognised is dependent upon the volume supplied including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
Estimated usage is based on historic data, judgement and assumptions: actual results could differ from these estimates which would result in operating revenue being adjusted in the period that the revision to the estimates is determined.
Provision for doubtful debts At each balance sheet date, each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade debtors and records provisions for doubtful debts based on experience including, for example, comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write-off history.
The actual level of debt collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery, which could impact operating results positively or negatively.
As at 31 March 2006 trade debtors were 95 million.
Impairment of intangible assets The Group records all assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value.
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, are assessed annually for impairment.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 30, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two types of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Restricted Share Plan and the deferred shares element of the Performance Related Bonus Plan to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are expected to be met.

All of the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the waste management segment which is considered to be a single CGU, as it is an integrated business.
Goodwill is reviewed annually or when other events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
The recoverable amount of the waste management segment is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in those calculations relate to discount rates, cash flows, price increases and for landfill, the compaction rate.
Cash flow projections are based on approved budgets and plans for the next five years and beyond this period on long-term growth rates for the waste sector based on GDP.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13%.
