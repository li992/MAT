FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 115 15 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest rate risk The interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Group, along with their effective interest rates and periods in which they reprice, as at 31 December 2006 and at 31 December 2005 are set out below.
In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
2006 2005 Effective Less than Effective Less than interest rate Total one year interest rate Total one year % $m $m % $m $m Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings Current see below 136 136 see below 90 90 Non-current 5.69% 1,087 1,087 4.91% 1,111 1,111 1,223 1,223 1,201 1,201 Financial assets Fixed deposits 5.20% 559 559 4.46% 1,549 1,549 Cash and cash equivalents 4.92% 7,103 7,103 3.92% 4,979 4,979 7,662 7,662 6,528 6,528 The current interest bearing loans and borrowings comprise short term bank borrowings and overdrafts, bearing interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
The financial assets principally comprise cash on overnight deposit or held directly with third party fund managers and short term investments with an average maturity of 30 days.
The main benchmark rates for US dollar financial assets are the relevant LIBID rates.
In addition to the financial assets above, there are $217m of other current and non-current asset investments on which no interest is received.
After taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps, the financial assets and liabilities above all reprice or mature within one year and as such are exposed to changes in floating rates of interest.
Foreign currency risk Transactional exposure 100% of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, as at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group companies concerned, having taken into account the effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been used to match foreign currency exposures.
Translational exposure During the year there was no significant change in our risk position in relation to the cash flows of the Groups principal six currency exposures sterling, Swedish kroner, euros, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
As such, no hedges were transacted during the year, and no hedges were outstanding at 31 December 2006.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
Changes to the value of the financial instruments are normally offset by our underlying transactions or assets and liabilities.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2006, with all other variables held constant.
Because all our debt was hedged effectively to floating rates in 2006, changes in interest rates will not change the carrying value of debt after interest rate swaps.
Based on the composition of our long term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2006, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $10m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2006, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.

None of the financial assets or financial liabilities have been reclassified during the year.
Carrying values are equivalent to fair values for all years presented.

Consequently, an impairment loss of $16m was recognised in the income statement during 2005.
No similar impairments have occurred in 2006. Credit risk reduces the fair value of the 5.4% callable bond by $1m and the 7% guaranteed debenture by $2m.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on the fair value of any other financial liabilities.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
With respect to the repayment amounts at maturity of the financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the 7% guaranteed debenture was $287m 2005 $287m, the 5.4% callable bond was $750m 2005 $750m, the bank overdrafts were $114m 2005 $84m and the other loans were $22m 2005 $6m.
