PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Defined benefit schemes During the year, the Group operated two final salary schemes: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme TP, which is a 1 60th scheme, and the Wickes Group Retirement Benefits Plan Wickes.
The Wickes scheme merged into the TP scheme on 30 June 2006.
The assets of each scheme were held in separate trustee administered funds.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of a scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 September 2005, then updated to 31 December 2006 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
The comparative disclosures for the TP scheme and the Wickes scheme, which were shown separately last year, have been merged to allow easier comparison with the 2006 values for the combined scheme.
a Major assumptions used by the actuary at the balance sheet date in nominal terms At At 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.1% 3.8% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.1% 2.8% Discount rate 5.1% 4.8% Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.8% In respect of longevity the valuation adopts the PMA PFA92 tables with improvements in life expectancy to continue in the medium term, with base year appropriate to the members date of birth.
This results in the following life expectancies at illustrative ages: Weighted average life expectancy for mortality tables used to determine pension liability at 31 December 2006 Male Female Years Years Member age 65 current life expectancy 21.5 24.5 Member age 40 life expectancy on reaching age 65 23.0 26.0 b Amounts recognised in income in respect of defined benefit schemes 2006 2005 m m Current service costs charged to operating profit in the income statement 13.5 11.6 Interest cost 27.4 25.8 Expected return on scheme assets 27.0 22.1 Total pension costs 13.9 15.3 In consultation with the scheme actuary and the Trustees of the pension fund the Directors are in the process of fixing the employers contribution rate for 2007.
