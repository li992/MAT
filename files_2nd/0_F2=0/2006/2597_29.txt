22 Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The funds of the principal schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the UK defined benefit schemes in April 2006 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 are stated at their bid value.
The amounts included in the financial statements in respect of the total operations of the Group are as follows: 2006 2005 Amounts included in net operating expenses m m Defined contribution schemes 6.2 7.0 Defined benefit schemes current service cost 5.2 6.2 past service credit 3.3 Total operating charge 8.1 13.2 Amounts included in finance income cost Expected return on scheme assets 11.6 13.5 Interest charge on scheme liabilities 12.0 13.5 Net financial cost 0.4 Total charge 8.5 13.2 28 Notes Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2006 22 Pensions continued 2006 2005 Amounts recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense total operations m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 7.3 15.8 Experience gain on scheme liabilities 7.5 0.4 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 2.6 43.5 Actuarial gain loss recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 17.4 27.3 The cumulative amount of actuarial losses arising since 1 January 2004 recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense at 31 December 2006 was 23.2m 2005: 40.6m.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were: Europe 2006 2005 Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years 20.1 18.5 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years 21.3 20.0 US Longevity at age 65 for current and future pensioners years 18.9 18.1 Europe US 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 3.75% 3.75% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 3.0% 2.75% 2.75% Discount rate 5.2% 4.8% 5.3% 6.0% 5.75% 6.0% Inflation rate 3.0% 2.75% 2.75% 3.0% 2.5% 2.5% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The market value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before being realised, and the present value of pension obligations, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are therefore inherently uncertain, are: Europe US Total 2006 2006 2006 Long term Value Long term Value Value rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 7.1% 105.1 9.7% 28.3 133.4 Bonds 4.8% 51.1 5.7% 15.6 66.7 Other 4.3% 0.2 4.5% 0.1 0.3 Blended rate of return on scheme assets 6.4% 8.5% Total market value 156.4 44.0 200.4 Present value of funded obligations 176.2 51.3 227.5 Present value of unfunded obligations 3.2 7.2 10.4 Present value of funded and unfunded obligations 179.4 58.5 237.9 Deficit 23.0 14.5 37.5 Deferred tax 7.0 5.1 12.1 Net deficit 16.0 9.4 25.4 Experience adjustments arising on scheme liabilities 7.4 0.1 7.5 Long term rate of return is based on the weighted average across all European defined benefit pension schemes.
