Under UK company law, companies were required to provide for their proposed dividend in advance of the dividend being declared and approved at the Annual General Meeting.
Under IAS 37, the dividend cannot be provided for in the year end balance sheet since, at that date, the dividend did not represent a liability.
Accrued dividends of 4.9 million have therefore been removed from other liabilities as at 31 March 2004.
Quoted investments are designated as held at fair value under IFRS and are carried at bid prices whereas previously, under UK GAAP, they were carried at mid prices.
As at 31 March 2004, certain discounts were applied to the valuation of some quoted investments to take account of their illiquidity: these discounts have therefore been removed in accordance with IAS 39.
The aggregate difference was an upward revaluation of 0.7 million and this also increased equity by the same amount.
Under IFRS 2, Share-based payment, a charge is required for all share-based payments which includes the long-term incentives provided under the Company's Share Appreciation Rights Plan SARs.
The SAR provision is now based on the fair value of the SARs using a binomial option valuation model whereas previously the provision was calculated by reference to the difference between the exercise price and the market price of RITCPs shares at the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax attributable to the SARs is calculated by reference to their intrinsic value amortised as appropriate during the term of the three year vesting period.
The reduction in the deferred tax asset at 31 March 2004 amounted to 0.3 million.
