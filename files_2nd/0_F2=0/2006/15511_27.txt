Taxation continued b Reconciliation of tax credit for the year The credit for the year in Continuing Operations can be reconciled to the profit loss per the income statement as follows: 2006 2005 Year ended 31 March million million Profit loss on ordinary activities before taxation 58 20 Tax at a standard rate of 31% 2005: 31% 18 6 Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 2 9 Tax effect of utilisation of tax losses not previously recognised 20 3 UK overprovision in respect of prior years 20 Deferred tax assets see note 12c 50 Tax credit for the year 50 20 c Deferred tax At 31 March 2006, the Group has the following deferred tax assets in countries where it will have ongoing operations: Recognised Unrecognised At 31 March 2006 million million UK 41 328 Germany 766 Other 2 50 394 The deferred tax assets relate to operating losses, pension scheme contributions and restructuring items.
Following the disposal of the Telecommunications Equipment and International Services businesses to Ericsson, the directors are of the opinion that the anticipated level of profits over the next three financial years supports the recognition of 50 million of deferred tax assets at 31 March 2006.
There are also unrecognised deferred tax assets of 394 million, which relate to the UK and Germany as set out above.
In addition, and separate from the 394 million above, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets representing operating losses and restructuring items in jurisdictions outside the UK and Germany principally Italy and the USA, after taking into account any gains arising on the disposals to Ericsson in the year ended 31 March 2006.
These tax assets may be utilised in future tax audits, for example, but otherwise are not anticipated to have value for the ongoing Group and are not disclosed above.
Deferred tax assets totalling 817 million were not recognised as at 31 March 2005 as the Group was not sufficiently certain that it would be able to recover those assets within a relatively short period of time.
Of the unrecognised deferred tax asset as at 31 March 2005, 514 million related to the UK and Germany the ongoing operations in respect of which an asset has now been partially recognised and 303 million related to the US, Italy and other jurisdictions the discontinued operations whose potential attributes are no longer disclosed.
There was no tax on items taken directly to equity in either year.
