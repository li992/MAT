16 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unquoted and quoted companies, and partnership interests which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objective set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 12 to 15.
A loan facility, the purpose of which is to finance tender offers, other share buy-backs and on-market purchases of shares, the financing of new investment and refinancing existing debt.
Investments are held with a view to identifying suitable opportunities for realisation.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
Market Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
The Group does not use derivatives.
The Board meets on a number of occasions during each year to consider the realisation programme of the investment portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular sectors.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the realisation programme of the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Electra Private Equity PLC 55 Accounts Notes to the Accounts 16 Financial Instruments Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including both realised and unrealised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through loan facilities.
During the year, long-term multi-currency loan facilities were in existence.
The initial drawdown under the loan facilities was in US Dollars and Euros.
The loans have a floating rate of interest.
The cash balances held on deposit mitigate in part the interest rate risk.
The resultant proceeds will be held as cash or short-term securities and used towards the repayment of the facility.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities are shown in part iii of this Note.
These profiles exclude short term debtors and creditors.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
There have been disposals in the period of both listed and unlisted investments, which have been used to repay loan facilities.
As a result the Groups liquidity has increased marginally during the year.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in part iv of this Note.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups total return and net assets are affected by currency translation movements as a significant proportion of the investments held in the year are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Revenue received in currencies other than sterling is converted into sterling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate.
The treatment of foreign currency transactions has been described in greater detail in the basis of accounting note on page 43.
The foreign investments held are principally in the USA, Continental Europe, Latin America and the Far East.
During the year, the Group held loans denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling, which partially offset exchange risks suffered during the current and previous years on foreign fixed asset investments.
Foreign currency exposures are analysed in part ii of this Note.

60 Electra Private Equity PLC Accounts Notes to the Accounts 19 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments The Company has undertaken to invest up to a further US$15,358,539 2005: US$12,561,000 in various syndicates of investors in the USA and elsewhere.
The Company has undertaken to make further investments through various limited partnership funds in the UK and Continental Europe amounting to 55,704,000 2005: 38,761,000.
At 30 September 2006 the Company had uncalled commitments of 2,142,000 to a limited partnership fund advised by Electra Partners 2005: 3,257,000.
As a limited partner in a number of limited partnership funds, the Company has entered into agreements with subsidiaries of Electra Partners for the management of the Companys portfolio of investments.
In consideration for this the limited partnership funds pay a priority profit share to their general partners.
The management agreements are rolling contracts which now allow for termination by either party at the conclusion of a one year notice period.
A Group undertaking is the subject of HM Revenue & Customs enquiry in relation to certain prior year transactions.
Whilst the matters under enquiry could result in a material adjustment to the Groups overall taxation charge, it is the Directors belief that the taxation consequences of the transactions would not be material to the Groups net asset value and have been fairly stated in the Groups financial statements.

64 Electra Private Equity PLC Accounts Notes to the Accounts 23 Change of Accounting Policy The impact of the movement from UK GAAP to IFRS to the Profit After Taxation, Total Equity Shareholders Funds and the change in cash and cash equivalents as per the Cash Flow Statement is detailed below.
As explained in the Basis of Accounting, the UK GAAP accounting policies in respect of financial instruments as applied at 30 September 2005 have continued to be used for the comparative financial information, as permitted under IFRS 1.
Income Statement Under IFRS the Statement of Total Return is now called the Income Statement.
Presentational changes to the Income Statement have resulted in the change of description of certain line items.
Dividends are no longer shown on the face of the Income Statement but are shown instead in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Income received from investments is now shown within the net gains on investments.
This was previously a separate line under UK GAAP.
Utilisation fees in respect of the loan facility negotiated in the year ended 30 September 2005 were previously charged to other expenses.
803,000 has now been reclassified to finance costs from other expenses in the prior year.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising in 2005 in subsidiary companies on loans in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currencies are now classified as other expenses.
512,000 has been classified as other expenses from exchange differences arising on consolidation shown in the prior year.
A reconciliation of profit as previously reported to profit under IFRS is shown below: Group Company Year to Year to 30 September 2005 30 September 2005 000 000 Transfer to Reserves for the period under UK GAAP 115,135 90,705 Ordinary dividends 8,702 8,702 Exchange differences arising on consolidation 478 Profit After Taxation Under IFRS 123,359 99,407 Under IAS 10 dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
There is no change in Profit After Taxation in the 30 September comparative period under IFRS from UK GAAP.
The exchange difference arising on consolidation, which was previously included in the Consolidated Statement of Total Return, is not detailed in the Income Statement under IFRS but is included in the Translation Reserve on the Balance Sheet.
Under IFRS 1 the Translation Reserve has been accumulated from the date of transition to IFRS and not from the original acquisition date as shown in Note 18.
The return on ordinary activities after taxation split between revenue and capital returns attributable to equity shareholders for the year to 30 September 2005 are unaffected by the above changes.
None of the changes described above affect the Companys legal and tax position as an investment trust.
Cash Flow Statement Under IFRS the Cash Flow statement reconciles the movement in cash and cash equivalents, whilst under UK GAAP it reconciles the movement in cash only.
The impact of this change is shown in the table below.
The presentation of items previously charged to operating activities has changed as some of these amounts are now considered to be part of the financing costs following the changes detailed above.
803,000 classified as expenses in the consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 30 September 2005 is now shown within finance costs.
The Cash Flow statement is now reorganised into two segments: the operating and financing cash flows.
Electra Private Equity PLC 65 Accounts Notes to the Accounts 23 Change of Accounting Policy continued Group Company Year to Year to 30 September 2005 30 September 2005 000 000 Change in cash under UK GAAP 11,256 Short term deposits 61,243 Change in cash and cash equivalents under IFRS 72,499 For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, short term deposits are classified as cash equivalents under IAS 7, whilst they were included as liquid resources under UK GAAP.
IFRS has not significantly changed any of the cash flows of the Group.
Balance Sheet and Equity Under IFRS dividends are recorded as a liability when paid or approved.
This has had the effect of increasing the total equity attributable to equity shareholders at 30 September 2005.
Under UK GAAP, declared but unpaid dividends were accrued in the period to which they related.
The affect of this is detailed below: Group Company Group Company 30 September 2005 30 September 2005 1 October 2004 1 October 2004 000 000 000 000 Total equity shareholders funds under UK GAAP 512,181 488,058 426,723 426,114 Ordinary dividends 8,702 8,702 Total equity shareholders funds under IFRS 520,883 496,760 426,723 426,114 There have been some presentational changes to the Balance Sheets.
In the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, accrued income is now included within investments held at fair value.
This has resulted in 17,593,000 of accrued income being reclassified from trade and other receivables to investments held at fair value at 30 September 2005.
In the Company Balance Sheet, the investments in underlying limited partnership funds are now treated as investments at fair value.
Under IFRS, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are no longer recognised as liabilities.
The restatement to the Group and Company equity shareholders funds is shown in the table above.
As explained in the Basis of Accounting IAS 32 and IAS 39 were not applied to the financial information for the comparative period shown in this report.
As permitted under IFRS 1, they have been applied for the first time for the year ended 30 September 2006.
The impact of this on the equity shareholders funds at 1 October 2004 is set out in Note 18.
A number of the Groups entities have US dollars as their functional currencies.
Differences arising on translation of their opening equity at the Balance Sheet dates is now recognised within equity in the separate translation reserve of the Group.
The impact on the capital and reserves at 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005 are shown in Note 18.
There have been no other adjustments which affect the equity shareholders funds for the comparative period.
