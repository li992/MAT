69 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting Policies a Basis of preparation Grainger Trust plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the group, and equity account the groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the company and not about its group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The company has elected to prepare its company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 127 to 132.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the group financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 October 2004 for the purposes of transition to IFRS.
The principal exception is that, as more fully explained in note m below, financial instruments are accounted for on different bases in the current year and the comparative year owing to the transitional provisions of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and liabilities which are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative financial instruments and investments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Transition to IFRS The group is preparing its financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the first time and, consequently, has applied IFRS 1.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position and the financial performance of the group is provided in note 38 to the financial statements.
IFRS 1 contains certain exemptions, both mandatory and optional, to assist the transition to IFRS.
The group has utilised these exemptions as follows: i Business combinations exemption The group has applied the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 allowing it not to restate business combinations that took place prior to the 1 October 2004 transition date.
ii Share-based payment transactions exemption The group has applied this exemption and has therefore applied IFRS 2 to all grants of shares and share options made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005. iii Exemption from restatement of comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 The group has applied this exemption thereby allowing it to present comparative information that does not comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Accordingly, the adjustments required for differences between UK GAAP and IAS 32 and IAS 39 are recognised in the opening balance sheet as at 1 October 2005. iv Employee benets In accordance with IFRS 1 the group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full at the date of transition.
Accordingly, the deficit in the BPT Retirement Benets pension scheme as at 1 October 2004 has been taken through reserves.
The group has applied the amendment to IAS 19 with effect from 1 October 2004 allowing it to report all actuarial gains or losses in full in the period in which they were incurred through the statement of recognised income and expense.
70 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting Policies continued b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities including special purposes entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
ii Goodwill and impairment The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued plus the costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of net identiable assets, including intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For details of the impairment review performed in 2006, see note 22.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
iii Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant inuence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investment in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The groups investment in joint ventures and associates includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identied on acquisition.
The groups share of its joint ventures and associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative postacquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
71 1 Accounting Policies continued c Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable group of assets and operations, reected in the way that the group manages its business, that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The group has identied six such segments as follows: UK Core portfolio Regulated tenancies UK Market-Rented Properties Equity Release UK Development European Tenanted Residential European Development.
More detail is given relating to each of the above segments in the chief executives review on pages 20 to 29 and in note 3. d Foreign currency translation i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the companys functional and presentation currency.
ii Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income statement.
iii Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the relevant period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve.
72 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting Policies continued e Investment property Property that is held for long term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the companies in the consolidated group, is classied as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value.
Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specified asset.
If this information is not available, the group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash ow projections.
A structured sample of in-house valuations is reviewed annually by external valuers who have an appropriate recognised professional qualication and who have recent experience of the location and type of the property being valued.
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of the property when it is probable that future economic benefit associated with the item will ow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the groups investment properties are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Land Nil Fixtures, ttings and equipment Five years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
73 1 Accounting Policies continued g Inventories trading properties Tenanted residential properties held for sale in the normal course of business are shown in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes legal and surveying charges incurred during acquisition together with improvement costs.
Net realisable value is the net sale proceeds which the group expects on sale of a property with vacant possession.
Land and property held within the developments segment of the business, including house-building sites, are shown in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents the acquisition price including legal and other professional costs associated with the acquisition together with subsequent development cost net of amounts transferred to costs of sale.
Net realisable value is the current market value which the group expects to receive on sale net of associated selling costs.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
i Income tax Income tax on the profit for the periods presented comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method.
Provision is made for temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the values used for tax purposes.
Deferred income tax is calculated after taking account of any indexation allowances and capital losses.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and is calculated using rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date in the tax jurisdiction in which the temporary differences arise.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set off.
74 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting Policies continued j Employee benets i Dened contribution pension scheme Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period to which they relate.
ii Dened benefit pension scheme The group currently contributes to a dened benefit pension scheme that was closed to new members and employee contributions in 2003.
The full deficit in the scheme was recognised in the balance sheet as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years.
However, the valuation is updated annually by a qualied actuary for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reected in the groups financial statements under IAS 19.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and employee contributions.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities and the expected return on pension scheme assets will be reected in the income statement each year.
Actuarial gains and losses will be reected in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense each year.
iii Share-based compensation The group operate an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and a Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares and options.
This excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions which are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
Awards under the LTIS are fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model and under SAYE using a Black Scholes model.
When options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium.
75 1 Accounting Policies continued k Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is stated net of sales taxes and value added taxes.
Revenue is recognised as follows: i Rental and similar income Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term on an accruals basis.
ii Service charge and similar income Service charge and management charge income is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
The group acts as principal in the operation of service charge accounts and therefore gross income received is recorded as revenue.
Other income is accounted for as follows: i profit or loss on property sales profits or losses arising from the sale of investment and trading properties including development properties are included in the income statement of the group where contract completion has taken place.
profits or losses arising from the sale of trading and investment properties are calculated by reference to their carrying value and are included in operating profit.
ii Income from investments Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
l Leases i Group as lessor The net present value of ground rents receivable is, in the opinion of the directors, immaterial.
Accordingly, ground rents receivable are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Properties leased out to tenants are included in the balance sheet as either investment property or as trading property under inventories.
ii Group as lessee The group occupies a number of its ofces as a lessee.
After a review of all of its occupational leases, the directors have concluded that all such leases are operating leases.
Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases net of any incentives received from lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The net present value of ground rents payable is, in the opinion of the directors, immaterial.
Accordingly, ground rent expenses are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
76 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting Policies continued m Financial instruments Under UK GAAP from 1 October 2004 until 30 September 2005 i Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a xed rate to a variable rate or vice-versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an investment ceases to be a hedge, for example, because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
ii Loan issue costs Costs incurred in raising loan finance are capitalised and set off against the outstanding debt in the balance sheet.
The costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the facility.
iii Investments Investments are stated at cost less provisions for permanent diminution in value.
Financial instruments Under IFRS from1 October 2005 Derivatives The group uses derivative instruments to help manage its interest rate risk.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash ow hedge accounting in which case any gain or loss is taken to equity in a cash ow hedge reserve.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
77 1 Accounting Policies continued Fair value estimation The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on a discounted cash ow model using quoted market information.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Derecognition is the point at which the group removes an asset or liability from its balance sheet.
The groups policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash ows from the financial asset expires.
The group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party, provided the transfer of the assets also transfers the right to receive cash ows from the financial asset.
When the transfer does not result in the group transferring the right to receive the cash ows of the financial asset but it does result in the group assuming a corresponding obligation to pay the cash ows to another recipient, the financial asset is derecognised.
The group derecognises financial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
At fair value through profit or loss financial assets At fair value through profit or loss financial assets represents the groups holding of units in the Schroder Residential Property Unit Trust.
They are included in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value taken through the income statement.
These units have been designated at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the groups documented investment policy.
The group adopts the valuation provided by the fund manager as long as the valuation method adopted does not differ materially from group valuation methods.
n Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12-months after the balance sheet date.
o Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment in trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
p Provisions Provisions are recognised when a the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and b it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and c a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
78 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting Policies continued q Dividends Dividend distributions to the companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the group financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the companys shareholders.
r Assets held for sale Where a group of assets are to be disposed of by sale together as a single group, they are classied as a disposal group.
The disposal group is classied as held for sale as dened by IFRS 5 when they are available for sale in their present condition and the sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classication.
Non-current assets held for sale within a disposal group are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
s Investment in own shares The group acquires its own shares through the Grainger Trust Employee Trustee Company Limited.
The shares are held to enable the company to meet its obligations under the LTIS.
The acquisition cost of shares is debited to an investment in own shares reserve within retained earnings.
When shares are issued to employees under the LTIS, a transfer is made at the average cost of the shares issued between the investment in own shares reserve and the share-based payments reserve all within retained earnings see note 29. t Standards and Interpretations issued but not applied At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements, were issued but the application was not yet mandatory for the period: IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The directors anticipate that, with the exception of the additional financial instrument disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group.
79 2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Those estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities are shown below: Investment property valuations The group uses the valuations performed by its own in-house surveying team to value the core regulated portfolio.
A structured sample of these valuations is checked by external independent valuers.
Investment property in the JPUT and in Germany has been valued by external independent valuers.
In the UK, the majority of the portfolio is invested in the type of properties where demand is high.
Accordingly, the valuers generally have good information on current market prices for properties similar to our own.
Valuers also make reference to discounted cash ow projections based upon estimates of future rental income, anticipated property expenses and an appropriate discount rate.
Trading property valuations The groups residential trading properties are carried in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In assessing net realisable value, the group uses valuations performed by its own in-house surveying team.
A structured sample of these valuations is subjected to checks by an external independent valuer and where the valuations initially differ, agreement is reached after further discussion.
As with investment properties, the valuers generally have good information on current market prices for properties similar to our own.
Development trading properties are carried in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
All properties in the portfolio have been valued by an external independent valuer with the exception of short term housebuilding sites and assets pre-sold prior to practical completion.
Provision is made on a project-by-project basis to reduce cost to net realisbale value to the extent that the total projected costs exceed total projected revenues.
Market valuation of regulated residential property assets The group values its regulated residential property assets for market value purposes by deducting a discount from the vacant possession value.
This discount takes account of the fact that the rental yield is generally below market rates and that it may be some years before we obtain vacant possession value and can then sell the property.
Over time, this discount has narrowed, although for the last few years we have used a rate of 27.5%.
Strong market and transaction activity has led us to believe that this discount is conservative and our valuers have now certied the valuation of these properties at 77.5% of vacant possession value, a discount of 22.5%.
This realignment has produced an increase in market value at the year end of 67m.
Distinction between investment and trading properties The group considers the intention at the outset for each property acquired in order to classify the property as either an investment property or a trading property.
Where the intention is either to trade the property or to hold it during its normal life cycle and to sell it upon receiving vacant possession, the property is classied as a trading property.
Where the intention is to hold the asset for its long term rental yield and or capital appreciation, the property is classied as an investment property.
Where the intention for a property changes, the property is reclassied accordingly.
Income taxes There are some transactions and calculations that involve a degree of estimation and judgement and whose tax treatment can not be nally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
In such cases, the groups policy is to be prudent and conservative in its assessment of the tax benefit that may accrue in line with the contingent asset rules set out in IAS 37.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such differences will impact on the income and deferred tax amounts reected in subsequent accounting periods.

Although property and asset management are one of the six areas in which the group operates, historically the financial results and financial position of that segment have not been recorded separately and it is not possible to reliably extract that financial information for the purpose of this segmental analysis.
In future, the results of this segment will be recorded separately and we will report this in future accounts.

Therefore, for statutory reporting purposes, these are added to the costs in those divisions.
The group administrative expenses shown above have been allocated as follows: 2006 2005 m m Included within property operating expenses see note 4 11.6 11.6 Added to the carrying value of trading properties sold see note 5 10.0 4.8 Disclosed as administrative expenses 10.4 5.4 32.0 21.8 89 7 Administrative expenses continued Included within total administrative expenses in 2006 are redundancy costs of 1.5m, abortive deal costs of 1.4m, an accelerated write off of equity release transaction costs of 1.1m and 0.6m of overhead costs relating to a subsidiary company SIP Home Limited which has ceased trading since the year end.
Resulting from a review of the allocation of overheads to the various business streams in 2005, the amount disclosed as administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement shown previously as 9.8m has been reduced to 5.4m.
The difference has been reallocated to increase property expenses by 2.0m and the carrying value of trading properties sold by 2.4m.
There is no impact on net profit and management consider the revised gures to be better cost allocations to the different business areas.

If it is found that all the capital losses are available for offset against capital gains, then provisions of up to 23m would be released over the coming years.
92 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Dividends Under IAS 10, final dividends are excluded from the balance sheet until they are approved by the company in general meeting.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below: 2006 2005 m m Ordinary dividends on equity shares: Interim paid of 1.87p per share 2005: 1.7p 2.5 2.2 Final for prior year paid 3.41p per share 2004: 3.84p 4.4 4.7 6.9 6.9 A final dividend relating to 2006 of 3.75p per share has been proposed by the board.
This will result in a further distribution of 4.9m.
If approved, it will be paid on 6 March 2007 to shareholders on the register on 16 February 2007.
The 2006 interim dividend of 1.87p per share was paid in July 2006.
This gives a total dividend for 2006 of 5.62p per share compared to 5.11p per share in 2005, an increase of 10%.
13 Earnings per share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Grainger Trust Employee Trustee Company Limited to meet its obligations under the LTIS see note 29.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the company may potentially issue relating to its share option schemes and contingent share awards under its LTIS, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2006 was the end of the contingency period.

These valuations were reviewed and approved by the directors.
A structured sample of the in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP, Chartered Surveyors, independently of the group.
Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP concluded that they have a high degree of confidence in all of the valuations.
Investment properties in the JPUT with a value of 210.4m as at 30 September 2006, were valued at their market value by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited.
The JPUT is considered to be a disposal group as at 30 September 2006, and 80% of the value of its investment properties have been transferred to current assets 168.3m.
Investment properties in Germany were valued by CB Richard Ellis prior to their acquisition by the group.
These valuations took place between September 2005 and July 2006.
The directors consider that these initial values have not changed materially in the period to 30 September 2006.
The value of investment properties in Germany as at 30 September 2006 is 116.9m.
The historical cost of the groups investment and development properties as at 30 September 2006, including those held as a disposal group under current assets was 370.4m 2005: 214.3m.
The revaluation gain in 2006 of 42.4m shown above has been included in the income statement.
However, an accrual for fees of 2.5m relating to the cost of raising equity investment in the JPUT has been set against this revaluation gain to give a net amount of 39.9m.
The total value of investment property shown in the above table, includes 13.0m 2005: 10.8m held under long leases.

98 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments i Financial risk management The group is subject to a number of financial risks, in particular, interest rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks.
Interest rate risk The group does not take trading positions in financial instruments but uses them to minimise the risk of exposure to uctuating interest rates.
The majority of the groups debt is subject to protective swaps, caps or collars or is maintained at xed rates of interest see note 23.
To protect itself against interest rate risk the groups treasury policy is to maintain oating rate exposure of no greater than 35% of expected borrowings.
At 30 September 2006, 66% of the groups debt was economically hedged.
Liquidity risk The group maintains a combination of long term and short term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that it has sufficient available funds for ongoing operations and to meet planned future investments.
Foreign currency risk The group invests in property acquired in currency other than pounds sterling.
In such situations, the groups policy is to take out loans in the same currency to act as a natural hedge against currency uctuations.
Credit risk The groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are shown net of provisions for impairment see note 20.
Such provisions are made where there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk as its exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties.
Until 1 July 2006, the group did not meet the strict criteria set out in IAS 39 to enable certain swaps to be treated as being effective cash ow hedges.
Accordingly, all fair value movements on derivatives were taken to the income statement until 30 June 2006.
From 1 July, certain swaps did qualify to be treated as effective cash ow hedges and the movement in their fair values to 30 September 2006 has been taken directly through equity.
The prole of the groups interest rate swaps in existence at 30 September 2006 which were classied as effective cash ow hedges at 30 September 2006 was as follows: Movement Fair value at Fair value at reected Movement 30 September 01 October in income reected Amount Rate 2006 2005 statement in equity Maturity date m % m m m m Interest rate swaps 07 June 2009 50.0 5.100 1.0 1.0 07 March 2014 30.0 5.170 0.4 1.3 1.1 0.2 07 June 2012 155.0 5.380 2.4 7.6 5.6 0.4 07 June 2009 55.0 4.782 1.0 0.8 1.9 0.1 18 December 2011 10.2 3.510 0.1 0.2 0.1 300.2 1.7 10.7 9.8 0.8 99 21 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued In addition to the above, there were a number of financial instruments that were in existence at 30 September 2006 but which were classied as ineffective hedges during the whole year to that date.

22 Assets held for sale The sale of 38% of the units in the Jersey Property Unit Trust JPUT completed on 21 November 2006.
Negotiations are ongoing with investors and the current expectation is that 80%, in total, of the units will be sold within 12-months of the balance sheet date.
Accordingly, as at 30 September 2006, 80% of the net assets of the JPUT, less an accrual for sales fees, have been reclassied as a disposal group under assets held for sale within current assets.
The balance is comprised as follows: 2006 m Investment property 168.3 Trade and other receivables 0.2 Cash and cash equivalents 4.5 Trade and other payables 4.7 168.3 Included within the transfer of assets into the JPUT on 1 December 2005 was 67m of properties that had previously been classied as trading stock.
On transfer to the JPUT their intended use was changed to them being held for rental yield and long term capital appreciation.
Accordingly, these properties were re-classied as investment properties.
A one-off revaluation gain of 23.5m was recognised within net valuation gains on investment properties in the income statement.
Goodwill amounting to 5.8m was written off following the transfer of the properties as they were transferred out of their respective income generating units resulting in the goodwill being impaired.

25 Pension costs Dened contribution scheme The group operates a dened contribution scheme for its employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Pension arrangements for directors are disclosed in the report of the remuneration committee and the directors remuneration report on page 56.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the group.
Dened benefit scheme In addition to the above, the group also operates a dened benefit scheme, the BPT Retirement Benets Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment manager.
Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualied actuary using the attained age method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2004.
This scheme was operated by BPT Limited which became a subsidiary of Grainger Trust plc in 2003.
The actuarial valuation as at 1 July 2004 was based on the main actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 6.5% per annum, salary increases of 5% per annum and ination-linked increases to pensions in deferment of 2.5% per annum, the scheme assets were valued at 10.5m and scheme liabilities at 13.3m, a funding level of 79%.
The actuary has recommended an employer contribution rate of 28.5% in order to eliminate the deficit over the expected working lifetimes of the members.
The actuary also undertook a Minimum Funding Requirement valuation as at 1 July 2004 in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995.
The value of assets of the scheme was determined at 101% of the liabilities of the scheme.
The scheme was closed to new members and to employee contributions in 2003.
Accordingly, there is no current service cost for the scheme.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the 1 July 2004 actuarial valuation but have been updated to 30 September 2006 by a qualied independent actuary.

Awards under the LTIS are fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model and under the SAYE scheme using a Black Scholes model.
Awards under the LTIS are subject to market performance conditions under which the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the company is measured against a peer group.
There is no vesting below median performance.
If the company TSR equals the median of the peer group, 40% will vest.
If the groups TSR is equal to or greater than the upper quartile TSR of the peer group, 100% will vest.
At points between the median and upper quartile of the peer group there is pro-rata vesting between 40% and 100%.
The Monte Carlo simulation model takes into account these market based performance conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares expected to vest.
No subsequent adjustment is made to the fair value charge for shares that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met.
Adjustments are, however, made for leavers and once adjusted for leavers the total expense for each equity-settled award is spread over the vesting period.
Options under the SAYE scheme are fair valued at the date of grant and are not adjusted thereafter.
Adjustment is made, however, for assumptions about leavers.
The tables below summarise the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above schemes.
For the LTIS, the number of shares or options is shown for both the maximum number at award and the latest number as at 30 September 2006 after adjustment for leavers.
This same information is given for the SAYE scheme.

Mr Sherley-Dale although never a director of Grainger Trust plc, was a director of City North Group plc at the time of its acquisition by Grainger in April 2005.
Following Graingers decision to sell the properties, an independent agent was appointed to market the properties.
A significant number of offers were received by the agent but Clocktowers was the highest bid.
On 1 December 2005, the bulk of the groups market-rented properties with a value of 197m were transferred to a Jersey Property Unit Trust JPUT.
The group owned all of the units in the JPUT as at 30 September 2006.
Details of the key management compensation are provided in note 8.
33 Capital commitments As at 30 September 2006, the group had capital commitments of 0.2m 2005: Nil.
122 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 34 Operating lease arrangements Future minimum lease payments payable by the group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Operating leases which expire: No later than one year 595 586 Later than one year and no later than five years 750 512 Later than five years 6,949 6,937 8,294 8,035 35 Contingent liabilities The properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a guarantee group provide the security for the groups MOF facility see note 23.
The properties in certain of the groups German subsidiaries provide security for the non-recourse finance raised in those subsidiary undertakings.
In addition, the group has an obligation, under the sale and purchase agreement for the land at West Waterlooville, to pay further consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts.
It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long term nature of the sites development and the associated uncertainties with respect to planning applications.
However, any future payments will not fall due until at least 2015 and will be spread over a number of years.
36 Post balance sheet events The group acquired a 308-unit residential portfolio in Munich for 32m at the end of October 2006 with anticipated completion in early 2007.
In addition, in November, the group and an external third party company, Development Securities, have jointly acquired a 10 acre site at Curzon Park in Birmingham for 33.5m.
On 1 December 2006, the group made a conditional offer to the shareholders of The Capital Appreciation Trust CAT which contains a portfolio of some 912 retirement properties.
The offer price values CAT at 71.6m.
On 21 November 2006, the group sold 38% of the shares in an independently managed private Jersey exempt company which, through its subsidiaries, invested in the JPUT.
This was after having raised third party equity commitments of 56m.
On 11 October, a 150m Euro credit facility was completed to fund further acquisitions in Germany and on 13 December 2006 the group renanced its main MOF lending agreement retaining a four tranche structure and 1.3bn of nancing but with lower margins and an average extension of two years to debt maturity.
37 Acquisition of subsidiaries The group acquired three subsidiaries during the year for a total consideration of 3.4m.
Just prior to the year end, 100% of Suburban Homes Limited was acquired for 2.1m.
The balance represents the acquisition of CCZ a. s. a company registered in the Czech Republic, in which the group owns 81.6% of the voting rights and the acquisition of the remaining shares in SIP Home Limited.
123 38 Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS Explanation of transition to IFRS As stated in Note 1, these are the groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in Note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2005 and in the preparation of the opening balance sheet on 1 October 2004 the groups date of IFRS transition.
In preparing the opening IFRS balance sheet, the group adjusted amounts reported previously in its financial statements under UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the groups financial position and financial performance is set out in the accompanying reconciliations and notes.
Reconciliation of equity reported under UK GAAP to equity under IFRS 30 September 1 October 2005 2004 note m m Equity shareholders funds under UK GAAP 223.6 177.9 IFRS adjustments Share-based payments a 1.6 1.6 Negative goodwill reversed b 81.6 85.0 Goodwill deferred tax adjustment relating to City North Group plc b 2.5 Dividend exclusion c 4.4 4.7 Deferred taxation d 96.8 102.6 Pension deficit e 0.8 0.2 Equity shareholders funds under IFRS 211.1 166.4 Reconciliation of profit for the financial year reported under UK GAAP to profit under IFRS Year ended 30 September 2005 note m profit for the year under UK GAAP 26.5 IFRS adjustments Share-based payments a 0.5 Negative goodwill b 5.9 Taxation d 5.6 Investment property revaluations f 5.4 31.1 notes a Under IFRS 2 the group operate an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and a Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE.
The charge in the year ended 30 September 2005 was 0.5m.
124 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 38 Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS continued As there is a corresponding credit to equity, there is no impact on group net assets in respect of the IFRS 2 adjustment.
The adjustment in the reconciliation of equity of 1.6m in both years relates to the reversal of provisions made under UK GAAP, UITF 17. b Negative goodwill of 85.0m arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004 has been credited to opening retained earnings at that date.
Subsequent releases of negative goodwill to the profit and loss account under UK GAAP have been reversed.
The reversal amounted to 5.9m in the year ended 30 September 2005.
The acquisition of City North Group plc on 15 April 2005 has been re-stated to account for the deferred tax payable on the difference between the fair value of the properties acquired and the tax base cost at entity level.
This provision is required under IFRS whereas no provision was allowed under FRS 19.
In the balance sheet at 30 September 2005 it results in the negative goodwill of 2.5m calculated under UK GAAP becoming positive goodwill of 5.8m under IFRS with a corresponding increase of 8.3m in deferred tax liabilities.
c Proposed final dividends at both 1 October 2004 and 30 September 2005 respectively reected in the UK GAAP balance sheets at these dates have been excluded from current liabilities in the IFRS balance sheet reecting the fact that neither dividend was a liability of the group under IFRS at those dates.
The proposed final dividend for the years ended on these dates is reected in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which those dividends were formally approved at an Annual General Meeting.
d A provision for deferred taxation of 102.6m has been made in the balance sheet at 1 October 2004 with a corresponding charge made to opening retained earnings.
This provision relates primarily to the tax that may be payable on the difference ascribed to trading stock properties on acquisition compared to the tax base cost at entity level.
This tax, which relates mainly to the BPT plc acquisition, could not be provided under FRS 19.
In addition, the adjustment includes provision for tax that may be payable arising from the revaluation of the groups investment properties and based upon the expected manner of realisation either through continued use or sale.
The future impact of making these provisions in the balance sheet under IFRS is that the groups effective tax rate, which has been historically high at around 40%, will be much closer to the actual current rate of tax of 30%.
This is because when properties are sold, the majority of the tax payable as a result of the sale has already been provided for under IFRS whereas under UK GAAP the full tax payable was charged to the profit and loss account in the year of sale.
This has resulted in a reduction in the tax charge of 7.2m in the year ended 30 September 2005.
After providing for the deferred tax of 1.6m on the revaluation gain see f below the overall reduction in the tax charge in the year ended 30 September 2005 was 5.6m.
e The deficit of 4.6m and the related deferred tax asset of 1.4m on the BPT Limited dened benefit scheme has been reected in the opening balance sheet as at 1 October 2004 in full.
When Grainger acquired BPT Limited it made provision for the pension scheme deficit.
As at 1 October 2004 that provision was 4.7m with a related deferred tax asset of 1.7m.
Those entries have been reversed in the 1 October 2004 balance sheet.
The net effect of the above entries is a charge of 0.2m to retained earnings at 1 October 2004.
The deficit had increased to 5.3m at 30 September 2005 and, net of tax, there was a 0.8m charge to retained earnings at 30 September 2005.
The group has applied the amendment to IAS 19 with effect from 1 October 2004 allowing it to report all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they were incurred through the statement of recognised income and expense.
f The revaluation reserve at 1 October 2004 of 13.9m has been transferred into retained earnings.
In the year ended 30 September 2005, the revaluation gain on investment property of 5.4m has been included in profit for the year in the income statement.
The deferred tax thereon of 1.6m is part of the adjustment referred to in d above.
