com Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, for the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are provided in note 28.
Accordingly, the Group complies with all IFRS, including those adopted for use in the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified for certain items carried at fair value, as stated in the accounting policies.
A summary of the more important accounting policies is set out below.
The Group, as a first-time IFRS reporter, has adopted early with effect from 1 May 2004 the following standards and interpretations as at 30 April 2006, the reporting date for the Groups first IFRS financial statements: IAS 19 Employee benefits amended.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, on capital disclosures, were in issue but not yet effective and have not been applied.
Adoption will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries for the year to 30 April each year.
The results of businesses acquired or sold during the year are incorporated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed and acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Control is achieved when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain the benefits from its activities.
Foreign currency translation Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
The exchange rates used in respect of the US dollar are: 2006 2005 Average for year 1.7751 1.8624 Year end 1.8176 1.9099 Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment of overseas subsidiaries and the difference between the inclusion of their profits at average rates of exchange in the Group income statement and the closing rate are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Other exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement.
52 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for the provision of goods and services to customers net of returns and value added tax.
Rental revenue, including loss damage waiver fees, is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the rental contract.
Because the terms and conditions of a rental contract can extend across financial reporting period ends, the Group records unbilled rental revenue and deferred revenue at the end of the reporting periods so rental revenue is appropriately stated in the financial statements.
Revenue from rental equipment delivery and collection is recognised when delivery or collection has occurred.
Revenue from the sale of new equipment, parts and supplies, retail merchandise and fuel is recognised at the time of delivery to, or collection by, the customer and when all obligations under the sales contract have been fulfilled.
Current non-current distinction Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or consumption in, the course of the Groups operating cycle and those assets receivable within one year from the reporting date.
All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Groups operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost including transportation costs from the manufacturer to the initial rental location less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
In respect of aerial work platforms, cost includes rebuild costs when the rebuild extends the assets useful economic life and it is probable that incremental economic benefits will accrue to the Group.
Rebuild costs include the cost of transporting the equipment to and from the rebuild facility.
Additionally, depreciation is not charged while the asset is not in use during the rebuild period.
Leased assets Finance leases are those leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment at the fair value of the leased assets at inception of the lease and depreciated in accordance with the Groups depreciation policy.
Outstanding finance lease obligations are included within debt.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement on a systematic basis over the term of the lease.
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation Leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of each lease.
Other fixed assets, including those held under finance leases, are depreciated on a straight line basis applied to the opening cost to write down each asset to its residual value over its useful economic life.
The rates in use are as follows: Per annum Freehold property 2% Rental equipment 5% to 33% Motor vehicles 16% to 25% Office and workshop equipment 20% Residual values are estimated at 10% of cost in respect of most types of rental equipment, zero for scaffolding and similar equipment, 15% for aerial work platforms and high reach forklifts and 20% for steel site accommodation units.
53 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Gains and losses from the sale of used equipment are recognised in the income statement as other income on transfer of title in the equipment to the purchaser provided delivery has also taken place except in the case of sales of rental equipment lost when in the possession of the rental customer which are recognised when the loss is notified by the customer.
Gains or losses in connection with trade-in arrangements with certain manufacturers from whom the Group purchases new equipment are accounted for at the lower of transaction value or fair value based on independent appraisals.
If the trade-in price of a unit of equipment exceeds the fair market value of that unit, the excess is accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the related purchase of new rental equipment.
Repairs and maintenance Costs incurred in the repair and maintenance of rental and other equipment are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Intangible assets Business combinations and goodwill Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, including any intangible assets other than goodwill.
Adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired made within 12 months of acquisition date are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
For business combinations prior to 1 May 2004, but after 30 April 1999, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at the time as subsequently amortised up to 30 April 2004.
Under UK GAAP goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 April 1999 was eliminated against reserves.
The accounting treatment of business combinations occurring up to 30 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as permitted under IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to the Groups three reporting units: Sunbelt Rentals: A-Plant: and Ashtead Technology.
The profit or loss on the disposal of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill relating to that business.
Impairment of assets Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment as at 30 April each year.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable and independent cash flows for the asset being tested for impairment.
In the case of goodwill, impairment is assessed at the level of the Groups three reporting units.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
54 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation The tax charge for the period comprises both current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences arising on investment in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Inventories Inventories, which comprise fuel, merchandise and spare parts, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at nominal value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturity of less than, or equal to, three months.
Employee benefits Defined contribution pension plans Obligations under the Groups defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension plans The Groups obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA rated corporate bonds.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
In accordance with IFRS 1 the Group chose to recognise the full pension deficit on the balance sheet at 30 April 2004.
The Group also took the option of adopting early the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits issued on 16 December 2004.
As a result, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The increase in the present value of plan liabilities arising from employee service during the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on plan assets and the expected increase during the period in the present value of plan liabilities due to unwind of the discount are included in investment income and interest expense, respectively.
Share based compensation The fair value of awards made under share based compensation plans is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of share options and awards is measured using an appropriate valuation model taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual awards vesting except where any change in the awards vesting relates only to market based criteria not being achieved.
55 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Insurance Insurance costs include insurance premiums which are written off to the income statement over the period to which they relate and an estimate of the discounted liability for uninsured retained risks on unpaid claims incurred up to the balance sheet date.
The estimate includes events incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
This estimate is discounted and included in provisions in the balance sheet.
Investment income and interest expense Investment income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, fair value gains on derivative financial instruments and the expected return on plan assets in respect of defined benefit pension plans.
Interest expense comprises interest payable on borrowings, amortisation of deferred finance costs, fair value losses on derivative financial instruments and the expected increase in plan liabilities in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
Financial instruments Details of the Groups treasury policies are set out in the Business and Financial Review on pages 33 to 44.
Derivatives The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
These are principally swap agreements used to manage the balance between fixed and floating rate finance on long term debt and forward contracts for known future foreign currency cash flows.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
All derivatives are held at fair value in the balance sheet within trade and other receivables or trade and other payables.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not hedge accounted are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Secured notes The Groups secured notes contain early prepayment options, which constitute embedded derivatives in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
At the date of issue the liability component of the notes is estimated using prevailing market interest rates for similar debt with no prepayment option and is recorded within borrowings.
The difference between the proceeds of the note issue and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to prepay the notes is included within Other financial assets derivatives.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate method.
The embedded option to prepay is fair valued using an appropriate valuation model with fair value remeasurement gains and losses being included in Investment income or Interest expense.
Convertible debt Convertible debt is regarded as a compound instrument, consisting of a liability and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt and is recorded within borrowings.
The difference between the fair value of the convertible debt at issue and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible debt.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items that are material and non-recurring in nature that the Group believes should be disclosed separately to assist in the understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
56 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Earnings per share Earnings per share is calculated based on the profit for the financial year and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For this purpose the number of ordinary shares in issue excludes shares held by the ESOT and shares registered in the name of employees but, subject to forfeiture if performance targets are not achieved, in respect of which dividends have been waived.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the profit for the financial year and the weighted average diluted number of shares ignoring any potential issue of ordinary shares which would be anti-dilutive during the year.
Underlying earnings per share comprises basic earnings per share adjusted to exclude earnings relating to exceptional items and fair value remeasurements of embedded derivatives in long-term debt.
Cash tax earnings per share comprises underlying earnings per share adjusted to exclude deferred taxation.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Employee Share Ownership Trust Shares in the Company acquired by the Employee Share Ownership Trust in the open market for use in connection with employee share plans are presented as a deduction from shareholders funds together with shares transferred by the ESOT to employees and registered in the employees name but subject to mandatory return to the ESOT if performance targets are not achieved.
Where these shares are subject to commitments to release them to employees subject to the attainment of performance targets in connection with the Groups long term incentive plans, then provision is made by way of a charge against profits to write off the estimated cost of the shares over the performance period which is normally three years.
When the shares vest to satisfy share based payments, a transfer is made from shares held in treasury to retained earnings.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Such assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Such assets are not depreciated.
Assets are regarded as held for sale only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which must be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs.
Finance charges, including direct transaction costs, are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Revolving tranches of borrowings and overdrafts which mature on a regular basis are classified as current or non-current liabilities based on the maturity of the relevant facility.

First priority senior secured credit facility On 14 November 2005, the Group agreed amended terms with the syndicate of lenders who make available its first priority asset based senior secured loan facility the ABL facility to increase the amount, extend the maturity, reduce the number of covenants and lower the cost of the facility.
Following this amendment, the ABL facility consists of a $525m revolving credit facility and a $272m term loan and is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage from LIBOR plus 250bp to LIBOR plus 175bp for term borrowings and LIBOR plus 150bp for revolver borrowings.
At 30 April 2006 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 150bp on revolver borrowings and LIBOR plus 175bp on term borrowings.
The ABL facility carries minimal amortisation of 1% per annum $2.75m on the term loan and is committed until November 2010.
The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which quarterly financial performance covenants are only tested if available liquidity is less than $50 million.
Available liquidity at 30 April 2006 was 155.9m $283.4m reflecting drawings under the facility at that date together with outstanding letters of credit of 15.4m $27.9m.
As the ABL facility is asset-based, the maximum amount available to be borrowed which includes drawings in the form of standby letters of credit depends on asset values receivables, inventory, rental equipment and real estate which are subject to periodic independent appraisal.
The maximum amount which could be drawn at 30 April 2006 was limited to the facility size of $797.3m 438.7m because the relevant asset values exceeded the facility size by $46.0m 25.3m.

The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 30 April 2005 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 May 2004.

com 28 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Explanation of reconciling items from UK GAAP to IFRS a The Groups revolving accounts receivable securitisation programme was disclosed under a linked presentation under UK GAAP.
The application of IAS 39 has removed the linked presentation and the funding received has been reclassified as debt.
This affects the opening balance sheet at 30 April 2004 by increasing trade receivables and debt by 52.2m.
The accounts receivable securitisation was refinanced through the Groups new first priority senior secured credit facility in November 2004. b The Group reclassified certain leases mainly related to our delivery fleet previously accounted for as operating leases as capital leases under UK GAAP in the second half of 2004 5.
Under IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors the prior period element of this adjustment has been recorded at the date of transition.
c The Group has taken the exemption from applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations to acquisitions occurring before 1 May 2004.
The goodwill arising from acquisitions occurring before that date remains at the amount shown under UK GAAP at 1 May 2004 except that the Group has elected to translate foreign currency denominated goodwill at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date rather than the historical rate ruling at the time of the acquisition.
This reduces the amount of goodwill by 16.7m in the opening IFRS balance sheet and 24.7m at 30 April 2005 from that reported previously under UK GAAP.
The goodwill amortisation under UK GAAP of 8.9m was reversed at 30 April 2005 resulting in an overall reduction in goodwill at 30 April 2005 of 15.8m.
d The Group has elected to adopt IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 May 2004.
IAS 32 requires the debt and equity components of a compound financial instrument to be recognised separately in the financial statements.
The 5.25% unsecured convertible loan note is a compound financial instrument.
Under UK GAAP the loan note was recorded as debt at a fair value of 121.3m when issued in June 2000 and was being accreted to the face value of the loan note 134.0m over the life of the instrument.
IFRS requires the fair value of the debt component of the instrument alone 97.0m to be recognised as debt when issued and accreted to the face value of the loan 134.0m over the life of the instrument and the balance 24.3m to be recognised as equity at the date the loan note was issued.
Consequently, the interest charge is increased under IFRS to make the interest expense the 5.25% coupon plus debt amortisation equivalent to that for a similar instrument, issued at the same time and with the same maturity, but without equity conversion rights.
Accordingly, the opening IFRS balance sheet at 30 April 2004 includes: the equity component of the instrument, 24.3m: and debt at amortised cost of 116.8m being the 97.0m recognised on issue plus the accumulated discount amortisation to 30 April 2004.
As a result, debt at 30 April 2005 is 10.9m lower than reported previously under UK GAAP.
In addition, due to the amortisation of the discount, interest expense for the year ended 30 April 2005 is 3.0m higher than reported previously under UK GAAP.
e The Group has a $100m fixed floating interest rate swap to mitigate its exposure to increasing interest rates.
Under UK GAAP the swap was accounted for using hedge accounting principles.
Under IFRS, the Group is required to fair value such instruments and reflect their fair value in its financial records.
The fair value gain or loss is taken through the income statement unless the instruments are designated as hedges at inception and satisfy the hedge effectiveness criteria, when it is taken directly to equity.
The Group has complied with the necessary documentation requirements set out in the standard with effect from 29 April 2005 and, accordingly, the effective portion of any unrealised gains or losses on the swap is taken directly to equity.
Prior to 29 April 2005 the necessary documentation was not in place and, for this period, hedge accounting was not therefore available under IFRS.
Consequently, the change in fair value has been reflected in the income statement in the year ending 30 April 2005.
82 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued f The Group has secured notes due in 2014 and 2015 which contain early prepayment options.
Under UK GAAP, the prepayment option was not separately identified and the notes were included within borrowings at amortised cost.
Under IFRS, the early prepayment options constitute embedded derivatives which must be accounted for separately.
The difference between the proceeds of the note issue and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to prepay the notes, is included within Other financial assets derivatives.
As a result, Other financial assets derivatives of 9.8m increase total assets at 30 April 2005 and investment income for the year ended 30 April 2005 is 9.8m higher than under UK GAAP.
g IAS 12 Income Taxes requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences rather than timing differences under UK GAAP.
Deferred tax also needs to be provided, where relevant, on the other IFRS differences.
The total impact on the balance sheet is the net deferred tax liability reduces by 3.9m at 30 April 2005 compared with that reported previously under UK GAAP due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset for tax deductible goodwill arising in the US.
There is no impact on the income statement.
h IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires defined benefit pension schemes accounting to be based on fair values at the balance sheet date.
Separate charges for operating and net financing costs based on actuarial assumptions in place at the start of the year are required through the income statement while recognition through the balance sheet is dependent upon the policy adopted for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in respect of employee benefit schemes at the date of transition to IFRS.
Additionally the Group has chosen to adopt early the amendment to IAS 19 issued on 16 December 2004 and recognise actuarial gains and losses arising from the full year actuarial valuation in full through the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
The balance sheet shows a total IAS 19 pensions deficit of 16.2m at 30 April 2005 which compares with a prepayment of 0.5m and accrual of 0.2m reported previously under UK GAAP.
In addition, the operating charge through the income statement reduces by 0.2m while the net financing cost, for which there was no equivalent under UK GAAP SSAP 24, is 0.4m.
i IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates requires cumulative translation differences to be reported as a separate component of equity and, on disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative translation difference related to that operation forms part of the gain or loss on disposal.
The Group has not used the exemption in IFRS 1 to set cumulative translation differences to zero at 30 April 2004 and will report cumulative translation differences from the date of acquisition of a foreign operation as a separate component of equity.
The aggregate amount at 30 April 2005 was 32.6m.
j Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payments, where an entity receives goods or services in exchange for equity instruments such as shares, share options and cash-settled share transactions, the charge through the income statement is based on a fair value of share options and awards granted.
The fair value of the equity instrument is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using the Black-Scholes model taking into account the terms and conditions of the scheme.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect changes to the expected level of awards vesting, except where the changes relate to the expected achievement of market based criteria.
IFRS 2 requires a charge for all such grants including awards, options and SAYE schemes unlike UK GAAP which based the charge on the intrinsic market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and so, for the Group, the charge arose on awards under the SAYE schemes, Investment Incentive Plan and Performance Share Plan.
83 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.
com 28 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued The transitional provisions of IFRS 2 permit a company to apply IFRS 2 just to share based awards after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Group has followed this option and accordingly earlier awards continue to be accounted for on the basis adopted under UK GAAP.
The transitional arrangements of IFRS 2 do not, however, apply to cash-settled transactions and accordingly cash-settled phantom option awards granted in 2000 and 2001 have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The charge under IFRS is 0.4m higher for the year ended 30 April 2005 than under UK GAAP.
There is no impact on the assets of the Group as the charge to the income statement is matched by an equal credit through equity.
k The Groups cash flows under IFRS are unchanged from those under UK GAAP.
The IFRS cash flow format is similar to UK GAAP but presents various cash flows in different categories and in a different order from the UK GAAP cash flow statement.
All of the IFRS accounting adjustments net out within cash generated from operations except for the reclassification of the debtors securitisation as debt under IFRS.
