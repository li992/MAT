Weve talked about the urgent need to modernise our business.
And, since our current leadership team took over in late 2003, weve outlined the strategy which we believed would enable us to build a better, more efficient Boots.
In a nutshell, our message to shareholders has been: give us time, and well get it right.
This year, its a rather different story.
Because in 2005 06, weve started to see the benefits of that strategy.
In tough market conditions, Boots has performed really well.
Of course, theres a lot more work to do.
But we can now say that, by taking the necessary and sometimes painful measures, we are making good progress on the road to a brighter future.
As you may notice, theres another difference this year, in the form of this document itself.
For the first time, our Annual Review incorporates an Operating and Financial Review, a new type of report intended to provide shareholders with a more complete and balanced picture of the company in which they have invested.
Richard Baker explains the reasons for this on page 6.
But for now, lets just say its about being more open and more accountable.
Which is what we think people would expect from one of Britains best trusted businesses.
