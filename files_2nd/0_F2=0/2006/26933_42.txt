Glossary Net asset value per share NAV This is the value of the Companys assets attributable to one ordinary share.
It is calculated by dividing shareholders funds by the total number of ordinary shares in issue.
For example, as at 31 December 2006 equity shareholders funds were 868,545,000 and there were 168,298,906 ordinary shares in issue: the NAV was therefore 516.07p per share.
Shareholders funds are calculated by deducting the Companys current and long-term liabilities and any provision for liabilities and charges from its assets.
Discount Investment trust shares frequently trade at a discount to NAV.
This occurs when the share price is less than the NAV and investors may therefore buy shares at less than the value attributable to them by reference to the underlying assets.
The discount is the difference between the share price and the NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.
For example, if the share price was 390p and the NAV 430p, the discount would be 9.3%.
Premium A premium occurs when the share price is more than the NAV and investors would therefore be paying more than the value attributable to the shares by reference to the underlying assets.
For example, if the share price was 400p and the NAV 390p, the premium would be 2.6%.
Discounts and premiums are mainly the consequence of supply and demand for the shares on the stock market.
