Details of the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Misys Senior Executive Bonus Plan MSEBP and the Misys 1998 Unapproved Share Option Plan Type I are shown in the Directors remuneration report.
In the year ended 31 May 2005, grants of options under the Misys 2000 Share Option Plan Type III were awarded to senior managers throughout the Group at the market value ruling on the date of grant.
In the year ended 31 May 2006, grants under the Misys Share Award Plan MSAP were made to senior managers at nil cost.
In the year ended 31 May 2005, awards under the Annual Award Plan AAP were made to Directors and certain senior managers.
The nil cost award comprised three elements: an Annual Award of shares which related to the executives bonus payment.
These shares were beneficially owned at grant but were placed in trust for two years.
Deferred and Matching Awards of shares were granted at nil cost and vested after two years.
The Sharesave Schemes provide for a yearly award of options at a discount to the market price and are eligible to all Group employees.
In the tables below similar share-based payment arrangements have been aggregated as follows: Share option schemes nil cost: includes LTIP, MSAP, AAP and MSEBP.
Share option schemes market value: includes Type I and Type III.
Savings-related share option schemes: includes the Sharesave UK and Sharesave non UK schemes.
Share-based payment charges Share-based payment charges are calculated by spreading the fair value of an option over the vesting period having taken into account any performance conditions.
The vesting period is typically three years from date of grant or the beginning of the bonus year in respect of grants under the AAP and the MSEBP.
Page 70 Misys plc Annual Report 2006 5 Share-based payments continued All options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model except grants under the LTIP which use the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The following assumptions have been used in the option pricing models: 2006 2005 2004 Risk-free interest rate % 4.1 4.2 4.9 5.3 3.5 4.5 Dividend yield % 3.3 2.6 2.9 i Volatility of Misys plc ordinary shares % Share option schemes nil cost 47 82 70 Share option schemes market value 61 66 67 54 66 Savings-related share option schemes 47 82 70 Expected lives years of options granted Share option schemes nil cost excluding LTIP 3 33 Share option schemes market value 6.5 4.5 6.5 4.5 6.5 Savings-related share option schemes 3 3 3 The following additional assumptions have been used for the Monte Carlo option pricing model: 2006 2005 2004 i Volatility of the top 30 Techmark companies % 44 51 54 ii Correlation coefficient 0.16 0.19 0.18 Expected lives years of options granted under LTIP 3 44 i Expected volatility was calculated using the share price history for the period equivalent to the expected life.
ii The share price correlation between the top 30 Techmark companies was determined by the historical correlation of the share price movements over the same period as the volatility.
Both models incorporate the share price at the date of grant.
The weighted average share price for options granted during the year was 2.35 2005: 1.86: 2004: 2.52.

At 31 May 2006 impairment reviews of the carrying value of these assets were conducted.
The value in use of each of these assets was determined from the present value of the future cash flows.
Discount rates of 11.5% and 14% respectively were used.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash flow projections for the Hospital Systems CGU: a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 3%, used to determine an appropriate terminal value multiple: average near-term nominal growth for the major products within the CGU of 8%: and average operating margins of 15%.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and the experience of growth rates and margins achievable in the US Healthcare markets as a guide.
The assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the Hospital Systems CGU are consistent with past performance.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash flow projections for the Sesame CGU: a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 2.5%, used to determine an appropriate terminal value multiple: average near-term nominal growth for the major products within the CGU of 4%: and average operating margins on net revenue of 9%.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and the experience of growth rates and margins achievable in the UK mortgage and investment markets as a guide.
The assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the Sesame CGU are consistent with past performance as well as the expectations arising from the change of the business model over time, brought about by the launch of Sesame Select.
The projections of both covered a period of 10 years as it is considered that this is a suitable time period over which to review and consider annual performance, before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows of the detailed projection.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by the annual and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for similar products.
Sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions have been performed and it has been concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the Hospital Systems and Sesame CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.

The facility comprised one tranche of $585m which will mature not later than March 2010 and a second tranche of $265m which was originally scheduled to mature not later than March 2007.
During the year to May 2006 the maturity of this second tranche was extended and it will now mature not later than March 2008.
Bank loans At 31 May 2006 the bank loans drawn down under the facility comprise 154.0m denominated in US dollars and 45.0m in sterling, which bore interest at 5.68% and an average of 5.52% respectively.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Arrangement fees of 1.3m in respect of the $850m facility were included in the original carrying value of the loan.
During the year to May 2006 further arrangement fees of 0.2m were incurred.
These costs are amortised in the income statement over the expected term of the facility.
The amount of unamortised facility arrangement fees at 31 May 2006 is 0.8m.
The facility is guaranteed by Misys plc and certain other companies within the Group.
The Group is subject to certain financial covenants on its bank loans: these include a minimum ratio of operating profit, before depreciation and amortisation to net interest: and a maximum ratio of net debt to operating profit, before depreciation and amortisation.
24 Derivative financial instruments All derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value and are calculated by reference to the net present value of future cash flows, based on exchange rates and interest rates quoted in international financial markets at the balance sheet date.

Forward currency contracts used to hedge fair value and cash flow risks Financial assets and liabilities, which are denominated in currencies other than those of the functional currencies of the entities concerned, are hedged using forward currency contracts.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in the income statement where they are offset by compensating gains and losses on the underlying items.
The Group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge the cash flow risk on contractually committed future cash flows.
Where the amounts are material, the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 are adopted and gains and losses on these contracts are held in equity until they mature, when they are transferred to the income statement.
Where the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 are not adopted, gains and losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses held in equity on forward currency contracts as of 31 May 2006 will be released to the income statement at various dates up to one year from the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives Certain long-term software licencing contracts are priced in currencies other than those of the functional currencies of the entities entering into the contracts usually US dollars, pounds sterling or euros.
Under IAS 39, such contracts may contain an embedded foreign currency derivative which must be extracted from the host contract and measured separately at each balance sheet date.
Gains or losses on these derivatives are charged or credited to the income statement.
The contracts are generally of up to 10 years duration, and this is therefore the period over which the assets and liabilities are expected to crystallise.

Floating rate liabilities comprise bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes and bear interest at rates linked to UK and US LIBOR or UK base rates, depending on the denomination of the loan.
Fixed rate liabilities comprise property, lapse and regulatory review and complaints provisions and finance leases.
The liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise non interest bearing contingent consideration and property and regulatory review and complaints provisions.
These financial liabilities are disclosed in notes 23 and 26.
Financial assets Financial assets primarily comprise cash deposits and investments.
Cash which bears interest at nominal rates comprises 60.6m 2005: 26.8m denominated in sterling, 14.3m 2005: 15.5m in US dollars, 12.4m 2005: 6.6m in euros and 6.4m 2005: 7.0m in other currencies.
Cash deposits of 23.5m 2005: 45.7m denominated in sterling, accrue interest at rates based on LIBOR.
Investments of 3.8m 2005: 4.1m primarily comprise contractual rights to receive financial assets of US and European technology funds which are non interest bearing.
Full details of these assets are given in note 20.
In addition, the Group has sterling financial assets of 17.5m 2005: 13.6m in respect of a receivable falling due in more than one year.
This primarily relates to non interest bearing amounts in Sesame, expected to be recovered from members within the next four years.
Financial risk management The Groups business activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk: credit risk: liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential effects of this on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily the US dollar and the euro.
Such risks can arise from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Page 82 Misys plc Annual Report 2006 25 Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange risks arise in a subsidiary when future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies that are not the entitys functional currency.
To manage this risk the subsidiary enters into forward contracts with Group Treasury.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency that arises from such exposures by using forward currency contracts with relationship banks.
Each subsidiary designates contracts with Group Treasury as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, as appropriate.
Foreign exchange contracts taken with relationship banks are designated at Group as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis and are treated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups risk management policy is to hedge all contractually committed transactions as they occur.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from floating rate bank loans and from cash held on deposit.
The Groups cash balances are kept in interest bearing current accounts and on short-term deposit, so as to maximise the level of return while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity.
The Group does not invest surplus funds in long-term fixed interest securities, and is therefore not exposed to any significant fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups borrowings are primarily at variable interest rates, which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Interest rate caps are used to protect the Group against significant increases in interest rates.

Compliance with these regulations is subject to a process of ongoing review and appraisal by both the FSA and the Directors.
Provision is made for the costs arising from specific regulatory reviews as well as from complaints from consumers, both received and anticipated, where these can be reliably estimated as set out in note 26.
The final cost of settling these complaints is uncertain and depends upon the proportion of complaints ultimately proved to be valid, the redress cost on each policy, which in turn is dependent upon the performance of investment markets, and the administrative cost of handling the complaints.
The recoverability of these costs will depend on whether the Sesame or member insurance policy responds, and if so, what level of excess will apply and the ability of Sesame to recover costs from members, many of whom are no longer part of the network.
In establishing the year end provision, assumptions have been made regarding each of these based on recent actual experience.
As a result the actual cost may differ from that for which provision has been made.
No allowance has been made for any future regulatory action by the FSA.
Contingent liabilities that are quantifiable arise from property rental guarantees that have been issued in the normal course of business and also from bonds that have been issued in support of tenders submitted to prospective customers.
As set out in note 29, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes including within the US.
The Group has applied to the IRS to correct a number of errors that had inadvertently been made in the operation of part of the US schemes, in order to preserve their favourable tax treatment.
At this stage it is not practicable to estimate whether or not this will result in a cost to the Company.
The annual contributions to the schemes by the Group are 5.2m 2005: 5.9m.
The Groups subsidiaries and the Company can be parties to legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
Whilst the outcome of current outstanding actions and claims remains uncertain, it is expected that they will be resolved without a material impact on the Groups financial position.

37 Adoption of IAS 39 As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group elected to defer implementation of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement until the year ending 31 May 2006.
The effect of adopting IAS 39 on the balance sheet at 1 June 2005 is as follows: At 31 May Transition At 1 June all figures in millions 2005 adjustment 2005 Non current assets Trade and other receivables 13.6 0.6 14.2 Deferred tax assets 21.9 0.9 22.8 Current assets Trade and other receivables 166.8 1.1 167.9 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 137.7 1.7 139.4 Non current liabilities Trade and other payables 2.0 2.6 4.6 Other assets and liabilities 222.0 222.0 Net liabilities 159.4 1.7 161.1 The most significant financial instruments recognised on the adoption of IAS 39 for the Group are embedded foreign currency derivatives which occur when certain software licensing contracts are priced in a currency which is different to the functional currency of those companies entering into the transaction.
The net effect of this at 1 June 2005 was a 2.2m charge.
Other financial instruments recognised include foreign exchange contracts, taken out to eliminate transactional currency exposures, and interest rate hedges, taken out to protect the Groups interest charge from increases in interest rates, which had an effect of a charge of 0.2m and 0.2m respectively at 1 June 2005.
There was a deferred tax asset on the above items of 0.9m at 1 June 2005.
Exchange gains or losses on debt previously hedging goodwill written off to reserves On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period, and their assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the translation reserve.
All material assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation involved are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts.
Exceptions to this are the Groups external foreign currency borrowings principally US dollar borrowings which are held as a partial natural hedge against the Groups foreign net investments.
On the adoption of IAS 39 a portion of the US dollar borrowings, which qualified for hedge accounting under UK GAAP, no longer qualify for this treatment.
This difference arises as a result of the different treatment of goodwill previously written off to reserves under IAS 39 compared with UK GAAP.
As a result, the foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the non-qualifying amount of the US$ borrowings are recognised in the income statement as exchange gains or losses on debt previously hedging goodwill written off to reserves.
This resulted in a charge of 0.2m in the year, being the first period of adoption.
This comprised a charge of 6.4m in the first half and a credit of 6.2m in the second half.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on embedded derivatives and on debt previously hedging goodwill written off to reserves are excluded from the calculation of adjusted earnings per share.

From 1 June 2005, the Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
As the 2006 financial statements include comparatives for 2005, the Groups date of transition to IFRS under IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of IFRS is 1 June 2004 and the 2005 comparatives are restated to IFRS.
IFRS 1 exemptions IFRS 1 permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time certain exemptions.
The Group has taken the following exemptions: IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on financial instruments have been adopted from 1 June 2005 and comparative information has not be restated.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations has been applied prospectively from 1 June 2004.
Cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations have been set to zero at 1 June 2004.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied to all equity instruments that had not vested on or before 31 May 2004.
IFRS adjustments The primary adjustments arising from the adoption of IFRS are described further below: a Goodwill Under UK GAAP goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum period of 20 years.
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.
The goodwill amortisation charge under UK GAAP of 52.1m for the year ended 31 May 2005 has been reversed in the IFRS restated results.
Page 91 Notes to the financial statements continued The effect of this adjustment on the balance sheet at 31 May 2005 38 Transition to IFRS continued is to decrease non-current provisions by 1.2m and non-current receivables by 0.9m.
An additional charge of 0.2m has been b Developed software included within finance costs for the full year.

Any capitalised costs are amortised over the useful life of the product.
