Executive share option scheme In May 1995 the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which is available to Directors and other senior employees.
The scheme offers options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.

The scheme is equity settled.
Those options which have been granted after 7 November 2002 have been fair valued using the Binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions are as follows: Grant date 12 11 2004 02 04 2003 Share price at grant date 2.33 1.81 Fair value of options granted 1,427,070 1,886,816 Exercise price 2.22 1.75 Dividend yield 1.43% 1.49% Annual risk free interest rate 4.61% 4.12% Expected volatility 29.4% 29.4% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of weekly share prices over the last six years.

28 Pension liabilities Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates two pension schemes, the Morrison and Safeway schemes, providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds and no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2005 and 1 April 2004 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the periods to 29 January 2006 and 30 January 2005 by a qualified independent actuary.
The current joint employer employee contribution rate of 14.0 16.8% of pensionable pay that applied in 2005 06 will continue to apply until the review following the next valuation of the schemes.
This is due on 6 April 2006 for the Morrison scheme and 1 April 2007 for the Safeway scheme.
Additional voluntary augmentation payments are currently also being made in respect of the Safeway scheme.
As the schemes are closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 30 January 2006 is 92m.
Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2006 57 Notes to the financial statements 52 weeks ended 29 January 2006 28 Pension liabilities continued Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2006 2005 Rate of increases in salaries 4.25 5.25% 4.25 5.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.00% 3.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.75% 5.25% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.00% Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics.
The current mortality table used is PA92 C2020.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at the age of 65 is as follows: 2006 2005 Male 19.9 19.9 Female 22.8 22.8 The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets were as follows: 2006 2005 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.00% 7.00% Bonds 4.25% 5.00% Property 7.00% 7.00% Cash 4.50% 4.75% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Equities 1,190.3 958.1 Bonds 211.2 163.7 Property 54.0 12.5 Cash 80.3 82.6 Total fair value of plan assets 1,535.8 1,216.9 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 1,952.0 1,625.0 Deficit in the scheme pension liability in the balance sheet 416.2 408.1 Related deferred tax asset note 21 124.9 122.4 Net deficit 291.3 285.7 58 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2006 Notes to the financial statements 52 weeks ended 29 January 2006 28 Pension liabilities continued The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the year is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Fair value of plan assets at start of period 1,216.9 1,035.4 Expected return on plan assets 83.2 64.1 Actuarial gains 165.3 59.9 Employer contributions 92.1 63.4 Employee contributions 12.9 16.7 Benefits paid 34.6 22.6 Fair value of plan assets at end of period 1,535.8 1,216.9 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the parent companys own shares or property occupied by the Company or its subsidiaries at either period end.
