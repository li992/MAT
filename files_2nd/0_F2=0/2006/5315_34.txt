21 Financial instruments continued Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiary The Group has designated certain external loans as hedges of its investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the US hedge was US $170m 98m, of which $100m 58m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and $70m 40m was in the form of an overdraft.
The carrying amount of the Euro hedge was Euro 65m 45m, of which Euro 40m 28m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and Euro 25m 17m was in the form of an overdraft.
Both the US Dollar and Euro overdrafts were shown in the balance sheet netted with positive cash balances, as there is an absolute right of set-off.
A foreign exchange loss of 9m was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to Sterling.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risk the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term uctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on Group earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.0m.
Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
It is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of the US Dollar and the Euro against Sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by 0.2m for the year ended 31 March 2006.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
