Second Interim Dividend In addition to the return of approximately 510 million to shareholders, on or shortly after 26 May 2006, the directors of London Stock Exchange plc resolved to pay at the same time a second interim dividend, in lieu of a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2006, of 8.0 pence per share.
This enabled shareholders to receive entitlement to the second interim dividend prior to the share consolidation accompanying the 510 million capital return.
Accordingly, no final dividend will be paid at the usual time in August.
