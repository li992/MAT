Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2006 49 THE NOTES 24.
Interest rate exposure The groups interest rate exposure is summarised below in the form of an interest rate repricing table.
The table reflects the repricing profile of the groups non trading assets, liabilities and net interest rate hedge contracts as at the year end.
The trading book exposures of Winterflood Securities Limited and Close Brothers Seydler AG are different in nature and so are excluded here.
This table shows the sensitivity of non trading net assets to interest rate movements.
The cumulative gap of interest bearing net assets of 564,379,000 2005: 482,451,000 broadly equates to the groups non trading share capital and reserves, which as a matter of policy are not hedged.
The table therefore demonstrates the groups policy of broadly matching interest rate exposure.
