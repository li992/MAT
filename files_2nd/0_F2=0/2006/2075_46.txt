The sections of the Remuneration Report referred to within this note form part of the financial report.
For long-term share-based compensation fair values at grant date are independently determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account Performance Hurdles, the exercise price, the term of the award, the impact of dilution, the non-tradeable nature of the award, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the award.
The fair value of Deferred Shares is estimated at grant date by discounting the total value of the shares that will be issued in the future using the risk-free interest rate for the term of the vesting period.
b Share-based payments are to be allocated and included in remuneration over the vesting period.
c Participants who are awarded shares under the GIS and the LTIP are entitled to a payment in lieu of dividends.
