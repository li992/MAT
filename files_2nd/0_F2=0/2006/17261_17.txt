Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison of the level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales.
Future sales are assessed based on historical experience and adjusted where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no longer continue to manufacture the particular item.
To the extent that future events impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary significantly.
For example, changes in specifications or regulations may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable value in excess of cost, obsolete and requiring such inventory to be fully written off.

The final dividend is based on an anticipated 657 million shares in issue on 6 October 2006, an increase of 59 million shares on the shares in issue as at 31 July 2006 due to a proposed placing.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share of 90.77 pence 2005: 81.61 pence is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of 537 million 2005: 479 million on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 592 million 2005: 587 million.
As detailed in note 9 below, the Group believes that profit measures before the amortisation of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements.
Basic earnings per share, before the amortisation of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, been presented in the following table.
2006 2005 Before amortisation of acquired intangibles 98.90p 82.60p Add back: amortisation of acquired intangibles 8.13 p 0.99 p Basic earnings per share 90.77p 81.61p The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 597 million 2005: 593 million and to reduce basic earnings per share to 90.02 pence 2005: 80.75 pence.
Diluted earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangibles is 98.08 pence 2005: 81.74 pence.
Non-GAAP measures of performance Trading profit is defined as operating profit before the amortisation of acquired intangibles and is a non-GAAP measure.
The current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.
Operating profit includes only the amortisation of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 where no amortisation of acquired intangibles was recognised, businesses that have developed organically where no intangibles are attributed and those businesses more recently acquired where amortisation of acquired intangibles is charged.
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Groups performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.

On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to cash generating units CGUs.
These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, net margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five-year period at the estimated average long-term inflation rate for each market ranging from 1% to 3% and discounted back to present value.
The key assumption is the discount rate, which uses an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital, based on the three-month historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates, adjusted for the risk attributable to individual CGUs.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2006.

All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 459 million 2005: 406 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the associated temporary deferred tax differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Groups bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR.
Certain interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity until realised.

Certain interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings.
The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a hedge and a proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings.
The ineffective portion was less than 1 million.

The contracts expire between September 2006 and November 2020 2005: August 2005 and August 2009 and the gains deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement over that period.

Bank loans and overdrafts continued The fair value of fixed interest rate loans payable after one year is 621 million, compared to their book value of 626 million 2005: no material difference.
The floating rate loans payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR.
Thus the fair value of these instruments approximates to their book value.

Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated.
Included in this provision is an amount of 31 million 2005: 32 million related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies.
This liability is fully covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in Trade and other receivables note 17.
The liability has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2006 based on advice from independent professional advisors.
The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 5.2% 2005: 4.5%.
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.

Retirement benefit obligations i Description of plans United Kingdom The principal plan operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies.
The contribution rates paid by employees at 31 July 2006 are either 5% or 6% of earnings depending on the level of benefits that were accruing at that date.
The Group and employee contribution rates are calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
Outside the United Kingdom North America The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2006 the cost of defined contribution plans charged to the income statement was 23 million 2005: 18 million.
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
Two of the US plans and the Canadian plan are funded: two plans are closed to new entrants.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan.
The remaining plans provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
Europe Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
The cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was 5 million 2005: 1 million.
Post retirement health care There are no material obligations to provide post retirement health care benefits.
The Group expects to contribute 23 million to the UK defined benefit scheme in the year ending 31 July 2007 and 15 million to the non-UK schemes.

To reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long-term rates of return on equities include a risk premium.
These risk premiums are long-term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by listed companies.
The expected long-term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, i. e. by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
For the UK scheme a premium of 3.0% per year as at 31 July 2006 2005: 3.0% was applied to the expected return from government bonds.
For the principal overseas schemes in the USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by the Group and, if relevant, the trustees of the plan and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long-term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post employment plans being lower over the long-term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK scheme the policy is to invest approximately 75% of the assets in equities and 25% in other asset classes, principally bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group.

Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued i Intangible assets Arising on business combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life, tested for impairment and provided against as necessary.
Under IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but must be tested for impairment as at 1 August 2004 the transition date and at least annually thereafter.
Goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP during the year ended 31 July 2005 has been credited back to the income statement under IFRS.
In addition IFRS requires identifiable intangible assets to be recognised separately on the balance sheet and consequently certain intangible assets, such as contractual customer relationships and trade names, which were previously recorded as part of goodwill under UK GAAP, have been separately recognised as intangible assets under IFRS and amortised over their expected useful lives.
Software Under UK GAAP software was included in plant and equipment and the allocation of its cost over its estimated useful life was charged as depreciation.
Under IFRS, only software which is necessary to operate hardware is included in plant and equipment.
Other expenditure on software is included in intangible assets and the allocation of its cost over its estimated useful life is charged as amortisation.

The majority of the Groups leased buildings are on short-term leases and, consistent with UK GAAP, are classified as operating leases under IFRS.
There are, however, a small number of leases where the building element of the lease has been reclassified as a finance lease based on the criteria set out in IAS 17.
Under UK GAAP, committed rental increases, which could be considered in the same way as inflationary increases and increases due to market comparables, were generally recognised as they arose and property lease incentives were generally recognised over the period to the first market rent review.
Under IFRS, committed rental increases and lease incentives are required to be spread over the entire lease term.

The Group has adopted the amendment to IAS 19, Employee Benefits which allows actuarial gains and losses to be charged to equity and as a result, the net deficit on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is carried in full in the Groups IFRS balance sheet.

Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued iv Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the cost of awards made under the Groups employee share schemes was based on the intrinsic value of the awards, with the exception of SAYE schemes for which no cost was recognised.
Under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, the cost of employee share schemes, including SAYE schemes, is based on the fair value of the awards, which must be assessed using an option-pricing model.
The Group has principally used a binomial model for this purpose.
Generally, for an equity-settled award, the fair value of the award at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with adjustments being made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions, such as EPS growth targets.
For a cash-settled award, the fair value of the award at each balance sheet date is used to calculate the probable liability of the Group: changes in this liability from the opening to closing balance sheet are charged or credited to the income statement.

Under UK GAAP, such derivative contracts were not recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains or losses arising on them were not recognised until the hedged item had itself been recognised in the financial statements.
Under IFRS all derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair market value whilst other financial instruments are accounted for either at amortised cost or at fair value depending on their classification.
Subject to stringent criteria, derivative financial instruments, financial assets and financial liabilities may be designated as forming hedge relationships as a result of which fair value changes are offset in the income statement or charged credited to equity depending on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting has been applied to the Groups interest rate swaps which are hedging floating rate debt and foreign currency financial instruments which are hedging the net assets of the Groups foreign operations.
