annual report 2006 notes to the financial statements.
1 Accounting policies Group and Company a General information Shanks Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. b Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as required by Article 4 of the European Union IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which are stated at fair value.
Previously, the Group reported its results under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The disclosures required by IFRS1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are set out in note 29 of this report.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied.
Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for its Private Finance Initiative PFI contracts as tangible fixed assets.
During 2005, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued draft interpretations D12-14 on accounting for service concession arrangements.
IFRIC is yet to finalise the guidance, which is expected to be published in the second half of 2006.
In light of these draft IFRICs, the Group has reassessed whether the balance of risk and rewards derived from the underlying assets in its PFI contracts are borne by the Group.
In absence of specific guidance within IFRS, the Group has reclassified assets relating to PFI contracts as financial assets as defined by IAS39.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2005.
Accounting standards and interpretations in issue at the date of authorisation of these financial statements but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The most significant judgements made relate to assumptions concerning discount rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates in connection with the Groups retirement benefit obligations see note 21.
In making these assumptions, the Group takes advice from qualified actuaries.
Other significant judgements made relate to provisions see notes 1 o and p and PFI contracts see note 1 d. c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements by proportional consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes.
Wholly owned subsidiary companies set up under PFI contracts are fully consolidated by the Group.
d PFI contracts The Groups PFI contracts are all Integrated Waste Management contracts.
In these contracts, the existing Local Authority waste management operations are operated by the Group from inception of the contract.
The PFI contract requires the building of new infrastructure to add to that inherited from the previous service provider and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the Local Authority at the termination or expiry of the contract.
The payments made to contractors for the construction of the infrastructure are accounted for as financial assets.
The Group accounts for the service element as revenue and the repayment element is deducted from the financial asset.
Interest receivable is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied in the contract payments from the Local Authority.
Reviews are undertaken regularly to ensure that the financial asset will be recovered over the contract life.
Bid costs are expensed in the income statement until the Group is appointed preferred bidder and there is a high probability that a contract will be awarded.
Bid costs incurred after this point are capitalised within trade and other receivables.
When the contract is awarded, the costs are included in the relevant financial asset.
continued 1 Accounting policies continued e Revenue Revenue represents the invoiced value of waste streams processed and other services provided including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised when processing occurs or when the service is provided.
f Share based payments IFRS2 Share Based Payments has been applied to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 April 2005.
The fair value of options granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Adjustments to the amounts expensed are only made in respect of non-market related factors.
g Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
h Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiaries and businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets acquired.
Capitalised goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS 31 March 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.
The profit or loss on disposal or closure of a business is calculated after taking into account any goodwill excluding amounts previously written off to reserves prior to 1998. ii Computer software Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives 1 to 3 years on a straight-line basis.
iii Other intangibles Other acquired intangible assets are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred, and are amortised over the estimated useful life up to 20 years on a straight line basis.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation, except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, and less provision for any impairment.
i Buildings, plant and equipment: Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives.
The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years.
Plant and equipment lives are: Computer equipment 1 to 3 years Mobile plant 5 years Generation equipment 8 to 15 years Heavy goods vehicles 5 to 10 years Other items 3 to 20 years ii Landfill sites: Acquisition costs, commissioning costs, engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised.
These costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
annual report 2006 1 Accounting policies continued j Impairment of assets Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever the events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an operating expense.
k Leased assets i Finance leases: Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in creditors.
Depreciation is provided to write off the assets over the expected useful life.
ii Operating leases: All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 26 to the accounts.
l Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are measured on a first in first out basis.
m Government grants and subsidies Capital related government grants are released to the income statement evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
n Unprocessed waste The accrual for the cost of treating unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value or processing cost.
o Site restoration provision Full provision is made for the net present value NPV of the Groups unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its landfill sites and this value is capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
In addition the Group continues to provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites, based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
p Aftercare provision Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs at its landfill sites based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the income statement and not charged to the provision.
q Discounting All long term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial statements as a finance charge.
The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
r Retirement benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under the amended IAS19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value.
The operating and financing costs of the plans are recognised separately in the income statement and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they become due.
Multi-employer schemes are accounted for as defined contribution plans where it is not possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies and the Group has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event of any overall deficit.
continued 1 Accounting policies continued s Tax i Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different to the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited through the statement of recognised income and expense or directly to reserves, when it is charged or credited there.
t Foreign currencies Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Groups exchange reserve.
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary is disposed of.
The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings with the translation of foreign operations.
Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising exchange rate movements in the exchange reserve with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the income statement in the period the ineffectiveness arises.
u Financial instruments i Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
ii Financial assets relating to PFI contracts Financial assets relating to PFI contracts are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration paid and subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
iv External borrowings Interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the borrowings to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
v Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
vi Derivative financial instruments As part of the Groups PFI contracts, the Group has a number of interest rate swaps.
These swaps are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the gains or losses between period ends being taken to finance charges in the income statement.
vii Other receivables and other payables Other receivables and other payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
annual report 2006 1 Accounting policies continued v Dividends Dividends are accounted for on a cash basis and are not accrued in the balance sheet.
w Segment reporting The Group operates in one business, Waste Management, and is divided by geography for management reporting and control.
Components that make up the primary segmental analysis provided in the financial statements are the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Central Services.
No secondary segmental analysis is provided as the primary segmental analysis follows the geographical split.

Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement because of their size or incidence.
Restructuring costs have been excluded as they are an unusual occurrence unlikely to recur in the near future.
Changes in fair values of financial instruments on interest rate swaps that the Group is required to enter into in relation to its PFI arrangements are excluded as they do not reflect commercial reality.

The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill using projected cashflows for the next twenty years discounted at the Groups estimated average cost of capital of 9%.
The cashflows are based on projections prepared by management covering a five year period, and include no growth assumptions after the end of the current five year projection.
The projections also assume that the current five year plan is achieved.
The calculations use effective tax rates specific to each separate segment.
The carrying value of the Groups most significant balance of goodwill relates to the Netherlands and is 129.9m 2005: 127.4m.
Other intangible assets impairment During the year there has been no indication of any impairment.
Accordingly, no impairment review has been carried out.
The impairment loss on other intangible assets of 0.5m for the year ended 31 March 2005 arose in connection with the integration and reorganisation of the Groups business in the United Kingdom.
Included in plant and machinery are assets held under finance leases with a net book value of 11.7m 2005: 12.5m.

Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.

annual report 2006 18 Borrowings and derivative financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies i Risk The Group is exposed to a number of financial risks, of which the most significant are set out below.
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates in Europe and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for movements in the Euro and Sterling.
Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign operations.
This exposure is managed primarily through Euro denominated borrowings.
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings see note 1 t. Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups cash flow interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings issued at variable rates to finance PFI contracts.
In order to reduce funding risk and maintain interest cover, the Group manages the risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps over the period of the borrowing.
Under the swaps, the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals mainly quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts, calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amount.
Whilst the interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows and hedge accounting under IAS39 would allow changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps to be recognised directly in reserves, the Group believes that it is not worth expending significant resources fulfilling the onerous documentation requirements of IAS39.
The interest rate swaps are therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS39 see accounting policy in note 1 u.
The swaps are presented in non-current liabilities together with the related long term borrowings since the Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk through the fixed interest rate on the Groups Senior Loan Notes and the fixed interest rate on finance leases.
Credit risk The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
ii Fair value estimation The fair value of interest swaps is measured by reference to the cost of foreclosing the swap position at the year end.
The fair value of fixed interest liabilities is measured by reference to the present value of their future interest payments against equivalent current market rates.

An element of the closing provision relates to costs of 2.3m that are expected to be paid next year.
The remaining part of the provision relates to restoration costs that are expected to be paid over a period of up to twenty five years from today.
These costs may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in legislation and technology.
Aftercare The total post closure costs of landfill sites, including such items as monitoring, gas and leachate management and licensing, have been estimated by management based on current best practice and technology available.
The dates of payments of these aftercare costs are uncertain but are anticipated to be over a period of approximately thirty years from closure of the relevant landfill site.
Other Other provisions principally cover onerous leases, warranties and indemnities.
The net present value of the rental on vacant leasehold properties has been provided in full.
These payments will be made over the next five years.
Under the terms of the agreements for the disposal of the United Kingdom landfill and power and other United Kingdom operations, the Company has given a number of warranties and indemnities to the purchasers which may give rise to payments.
continued 21 Retirement benefit obligations a United Kingdom The Groups and the Companys principal pension scheme is the Shanks Group Pension Scheme which covers eligible United Kingdom employees and has both funded defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
In addition, the Group also has two small funded defined benefit schemes, which are included in the defined benefit pension scheme disclosures below.
The total United Kingdom pension cost for the year was 1.9m 2005: 2.4m.
Pension costs for the defined benefit section are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
Assumptions The most recent actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the Group dated 5 April 2003 have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2006.
The main assumptions were as follows: 2006 2005 % pa % pa Discount rate 4.9 5.4 Future salary growth 4.5 4.4 Rate of increase in pensions payment 2.9 2.8 Rate of price inflation 3.0 2.9 The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.

These schemes are treated as defined contribution schemes as it is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes.
No additional assets or liabilities have been recognised with regard to the schemes due to the uncertainty relating to the existence of contractual obligations for the Group to fund any deficit and due to the unavailability of reliable data to evaluate the existence and amount of such assets and liabilities.

29 Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS As stated in note 1 b, the Group previously prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
As a result of adopting IFRS in respect of the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group has restated comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2005.
As required by IFRS1 - First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the reconciliation between previously reported UK GAAP based information and their IFRS equivalents is set out below.

It requires that the IFRS accounting policies to be applied for the first consolidation as at 31 March 2006 are determined and then applied retrospectively to the comparative balance sheet at 31 March 2005 and opening balance sheet at 31 March 2004 the transition date.
IFRS1 contains certain optional exemptions to assist the Group in its transition to IFRS.
Significant instances where the Group has opted for these exemptions together with other changes in accounting policy required through the adoption of IFRS are described below.
IAS1 Presentation of financial statements IAS1 sets out the basis on which the Groups financial statements are to be presented.
The most significant change to presentation made to the Income Statement is in respect of the position of the profits of discontinued operations and the profit on their disposal.
These are now included on an after tax basis below profit after tax on continuing operations.
For the balance sheet the most significant change is in respect of deferred tax where certain deferred tax assets are no longer netted from deferred tax liabilities.
continued 29 Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS continued IFRS2 Share based payments IFRS2 requires measurement of share based transactions with employees at fair value at the date of grant.
This value forms the basis of the charge to the income statement over the period between grant and exercise.
The fair values of the various incentive or share plans have been calculated using appropriate valuation models.
Under a transitional exemption covering firsttime adoption, this applies only to options granted after 7 November 2002.
IFRS3 Business combinations Acquisitions that took place after the transition date must be accounted for under IFRS.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption given in IFRS1 to not restate acquisitions made prior to the transition date on an IFRS basis.
The Group has applied the exemption given in IFRS1 to treat the net book value of goodwill as deemed cost as at the transition date.
This exemption extends to amounts written off directly to reserves.
Consequently, on disposal of operations, there is no requirement to reinstate any associated goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Amortisation of goodwill under UK GAAP is replaced by an annual impairment review under IFRS3.
IAS7 Cash flow statements Other than the reclassifications for presentation purposes, there are no material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRS and that presented under UK GAAP.
IAS10 Events after the balance sheet date Under IAS10 dividends declared after the period end do not represent a present obligation under IAS37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as it is subject to approval.
The accrual for the final dividend under UK GAAP is reversed for IFRS purposes and accounted for in the subsequent reporting period.
IAS12 Income taxes Provision for deferred tax has to be included where assets are held at values different to the tax base cost.
Whilst the Group does not revalue property, certain properties were held at valuation prior to acquisition by the Group.
Under UK GAAP no deferred tax provision was included, as there was no intention to dispose of the properties.
IFRS requires provision irrespective of any plans for the propertys use.
IAS17 Leases The definition of a finance lease under IAS17 differs to that under UK GAAP.
Accordingly, a number of operating leases are now accounted for as finance leases under IFRS.
The relevant asset is recognised as part of property, plant and equipment and a corresponding finance lease creditor included in net debt.
IAS19 Employee benefits Previously the Group has accounted for pensions under SSAP 24 Pension Costs and had adopted the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
IAS19 like FRS 17 requires the Group to consolidate its proportion of the assets, liabilities and returns of the defined benefit schemes in which the Group participates.
It also changes the basis for recognising the cost of future pension liabilities.
The net pension deficit is included within liabilities with the corresponding deferred tax asset included in assets.
Actuarial gains and losses on the pension scheme are taken through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the year they arise from transition date, in accordance with the amendment to IAS19 Employee Benefits issued on 16 December 2004.
IAS21 The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates Under IAS21 cumulative exchange rate variances on the net investment in foreign operations are recognised in a separate equity reserve.
The Group has elected to set these exchange differences to zero at the transition date, as permitted under IFRS1.
The Group has applied the principles of IAS39 on hedge accounting for intercompany loans denominated in Euros and reported in subsidiaries that have a Sterling functional currency.
As a result, exchange rate variances arising on these loans will be reflected in reserves.
annual report 2006 29 Reconciliation of UK GAAP to IFRS continued IAS31 Interest in joint ventures IAS31 gives a choice for accounting for joint ventures under either the equity method or the preferred method of proportional consolidation.
The Group has opted to use proportional consolidation, which requires line by line consolidation of the Groups share of income and expenditure and the share of assets and liabilities.
This change has no effect on the Groups consolidated profits after tax and net assets.
IAS39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement: and IAS32 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation The Group has various integrated waste management contracts with certain UK local authorities concluded under the Private Finance Initiative PFI.
It is also bidding for further contracts.
As stated in note 1 b, the Group has reclassified its PFI assets as financial assets which are measured at amortised cost.
At the financial close of a PFI contract, the price of the service is determined, inter alia, by the long term interest rate available in the market.
The Group therefore protects itself against fluctuations in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps to match its future cash inflows and outflows.
Under IFRS these swaps are revalued at current market value at each reporting date irrespective of the commercial reasons for entering into them.
Revaluation of these swaps can lead to large accounting gains or losses but does not affect the long term profitability of the contract as the Group has matched its long term revenue and costs.
Whilst IFRS does allow these gains and losses to be taken directly to reserves, it is on the proviso that onerous documentation requirements are fulfilled.
The Group believes it is not worth expending significant resources fulfilling these requirements in respect of an item that does not reflect the commercial reality.
Accounting for changes in the market value could therefore cause major fluctuations to our reported profits.
