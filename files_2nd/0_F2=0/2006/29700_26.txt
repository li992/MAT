SVG Capital plc Financial information Annual Report and Accounts 2006 54 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, and to the extent that they have been adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2005 is consistent with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis compliant with the SORP.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
Financial statements of all Group companies are prepared for the same reporting period.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
However, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Presentation of income statement In order to better reect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the income statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under Section 266 of the Companies Act 1985, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Companys contractual right to the cash ow from the asset expires or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, with gains and losses recognised in the income account.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to proting from their total return in the form of income or capital gains, such financial assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Incidental costs on acquisition of such assets are expensed.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which for investment funds is at their net asset value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.
Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC Valuation Guidelines.
New investments are initially carried at cost, for a limited period, being the price of the most recent investment in the investee.
This is in accordance with IPEVC Guidelines as the cost of recent investments will generally provide a good indication of fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Gains and losses arising from investments, designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on fair value through profit or loss investments are included within the changes in its fair value.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial information 55 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with interest rate uctuations.
It is not the Groups policy to trade in derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Fair value is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Gains or losses arising in the fair value of cash ow hedges in the form of derivative instruments are taken directly to the statement of changes in equity.
Such gains and losses are taken to the capital reserve in the balance sheet.
On maturity or early redemption the realised gains or losses arising from cash ow hedges in the form of derivative instruments are taken to the income statement, with an associated transfer from the capital reserve to the revenue reserve in the statement of changes in equity in respect of unrealised gains or losses arising in the fair value of the same arrangement.
The Group considers its interest rate swap qualies for hedge accounting when the following criteria are satisfied: the instrument must be related to an asset or liability: it must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a xed rate or vice versa: and it must match the principal amounts and maturity date of the hedged item.
Current financial assets Financial assets purchased with a view to subsequent resale to an associated entity warehoused investments are carried at fair value, being the proposed transfer price of the asset, and included in current assets.
Investments in subsidiaries In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investment in subsidiaries at cost, unless they are investment vehicles, in which case they are included at fair value.
Investments in associates In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates, the standard does not apply to investments held in associates by private equity organisations that are designated as fair value through profit and loss.
Such investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant inuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Bank borrowings and loan notes Interest-bearing bank loans and loan notes issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.
The carrying amount to maturity of the liability component is measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments with employees of the Group are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
No expense is recognised in the Companys income statement as there are no options issued in consideration for the provision of employee services to the Company.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income is classied within operating activities in the cash ow statement.
SVG Capital plc Financial information Annual Report and Accounts 2006 56 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued continued 1 Accounting policies continued Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established and is classied within operating activities in the cash ow statement.
The Companys revenue and capital gains are expected to be derived primarily from future distributions in respect of its holdings in fund investments.
The Company will account for such distributions by reference to the underlying source of the distribution.
Realised profits on capital distributions which arise from the realisation of investments within the funds will be credited to the income statement and taken to the Companys capital reserve.
Income distributions will be credited to the income statement and taken to the Companys revenue reserve.
Management and advisory fee income are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
The Group as lessee Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
All borrowing costs are charged directly to revenue and are classied within operating activities in the cash ow statement.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The costs relating to dened benefit schemes are accounted for in the same way as for dened contribution schemes where the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying performance and financial position of the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes.
Such situations arise where the contributions payable by the Group are set in terms of the scheme as a whole and, as such, there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the Groups obligations, plan assets, or costs.
Other employee benets Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees.
A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is pounds Sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates uctuate signicantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups capital reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investment trusts which have approval under Section 842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial information 57 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost, including direct acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Telecommunications and ofce equipment 10% 20% Leasehold improvements 10% Computer equipment 20% 33% The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes.
Assets are classied as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to cash and are not subject to significant changes in value.
The Company has classied short-term bank deposits, investments in money market funds and short-dated treasury bills as cash equivalents.
Summary of new standards and interpretations not applied The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.

During the year ended 31 December 2006, gains on investments amounted to 198.0 million 2005: 142.5 million for the Group and 197.2 million 2005: 43.2 million for the Company.
As detailed in note 31, the Company has agreed that it should focus its future investments mainly on Permira Funds.
As such, and given that our largest exposures currently are to Permira Funds see notes 19 and 33, we expect that the future performance of the Company will be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest.

They do not receive fees for these services.
Nicholas Ferguson and members of his family and Andrew Williams have an interest in the Carried Interest in respect of certain private equity funds.
With the introduction of the Executive Share Option Plan in May 2001, Nicholas Ferguson and Andrew Williams gave up a portion of their entitlement to Carried Interest on existing private equity funds and any entitlement they may have to Carried Interest on certain private equity funds launched after 2001 in return for share options granted by the Company under the Executive Share Option Plan.
Nicholas Ferguson and Andrew Williams also participate in the Schroder Ventures Co-Investment Scheme and Schroder Ventures Investments Limited.
They have received no new carried interest allocations and made no new commitments since they joined SVG Capital in 2001.
As detailed in the Remuneration Report, the Companys Chief Executive, Andrew Williams, is employed by Schroder Investment Management Limited and is a member of Schroders Retirement Benets Scheme.
Mr Williams is seconded to SVG Advisers, which pays all the costs of his employment.
Damon Bufni has an interest in 6 million SVG shares since he has an interest in Permira Holdings Limited, the parent of Permira Capital Limited which owns 6 million SVG shares.
Further, Permira Holdings Limited is a party to an operating agreement with the Company dated 21 March 2005 more particularly described in a Circular to shareholders dated 24 March 2005 pursuant to which a SVG Capital Group has committed to be the major investor in future funds designed, managed or advised by entities in the Permira Group and during the term of that agreement is entitled to access to such funds: and b SVG Capital Group has agreed not to commit to any private equity fund or product for direct investment, other than agreed commitments to other private equity funds and Japan funds, which are not designed, managed or advised by entities in the Permira Group.
As a result of Mr Bufnis interest in the Permira entities described above, Mr Bufni will not participate in any decisions relating to commitments made, or which may be made, by SVG Capital Group to any funds or products designed, managed or advised by entities in the Permira Group.
No other Director has any material interest in any other contract that is significant to the Companys business.

As a substantial investor in SVG funds, Aegon has negotiated certain fee rebates on funds in which it invests not including SVG Capital plc.
The Company has warehoused various private equity fund investments for subsequent transfer to SVG Diamond Holdings II Limited Diamond II and to SVG Diamond Holdings III Limited Diamond III and Key Capital SVG CLO Equity Fund CLO Fund.
SVG Capital plc is or is expected to be a significant investor in all of these funds, which are also advised by SVGA.
Diamond II closed on 22 February 2006, the CLO Fund had a first close in December 2006 and Diamond III is expected to close shortly.
All funds warehoused by SVG Capital plc that have been transferred to date have been transferred at fair value, which in most cases is simply cost plus an interest charge.
As detailed in last years financial statements, the Company made six primary commitments to, and eight secondary purchases of, private equity funds for the Diamond II warehouse.
Diamond II closed on 22 February 2006 and the funds were transferred for total consideration of 353 million, including interest of more than 31 million.
During the year, the Company transferred 382 million of original commitments to Permira Europe III PE III to P25 Limited Partnership Incorporated P25, in direct proportion to other investors in P25, who also transferred PE III interests.
P25 then made a direct commitment of 3550 million to Permira IV P IV, of which a commitment of 3262 million had been warehoused by SVG Capital plc on the first close of P IV.
In addition, the Company also warehoused and subsequently transferred P IV commitments of 358 million to P1234 Limited, 359 million to SVG Sapphire IV Limited and 365 million to Sapphire IV PCC Limited.
During the year SVGA received 31.6 million of SVG Diamond Holdings Limited Loan Notes and 30.6 million of Diamond II Loan Notes, as part of its ongoing investment advisory fee arrangements.
These Notes were purchased from SVGA by SVG Capital plc at par value on the date of issue, as the holding of investments is the main activity of the parent company.
In April 2006, Platinum Trust, a subsidiary of SVG Capital, distributed assets valued at 55.9 million to the Company.
There were no other dividends paid by subsidiaries during the year 2005: none.
32 Risk Financial instruments and risk prole The Companys investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing principally in private equity funds which are managed or advised by Permira, a leading international private equity specialist.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated nancing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available for dividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date, other than the interest rate swap agreement referred to in note 18.

Floating rate financial assets consist of short-term deposits and money market funds.
Fixed rate financial assets comprise Treasury Bills, which have a known yield to redemption.
All financial assets are included at fair value.
b Financial liabilities of the Group The Company issued 107.3 million of Senior Notes during the year.
The Company does not have any other borrowings at the balance sheet date, although it does have in place a loan facility of 3600 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing this risk as summarised below.
This policy has remained substantially unchanged since the launch of the Company Interest rate risk The Companys revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since the majority of its income ordinarily derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on its Senior Notes and drawing on the loan facility that may be taken out from time to time.
The Companys primary objective is to achieve capital returns from its investments and, as such, the main exposure to interest rate risk is indirect, through its impact on the valuation of the private equity funds, although it is not possible to quantify such effects.
Interest rates are one of the key determinants of economic growth.
At a more specic level, interest rates also have an important role in the ability of private equity funds to secure profitable deals, as many transactions are partly nanced by debt.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately below.
At 31 December 2006, the Company held investments in money market funds valued at 47.7 million 2005: 40.7 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds were redeemable on less than 24 hours notice.
Other oating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short-term deposits.
At 31 December 2006, the Company held investments in short-dated euro-denominated treasury bills valued at 240.8 million 2005: 127.3 million, earning interest at a weighted average rate of 3.3%.
The treasury bills had maturity dates ranging from 11 January 2007 to 1 February 2007.
At 31 December 2006, the Company had 107.3 million of Senior Notes in issue see note 18.
Interest rate risk on the Senior Notes is mitigated as the US dollar and euro denominated Notes pay xed rates of interest and a swap agreement has been taken out with respect to the oating rate sterling Notes.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial information 77 32 Risk continued Currency risk The Company is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be signicantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
However, the Company has issued Senior Notes of US$170 million and 320 million, respectively, which act as a partial hedge against assets denominated in those currencies.
The Company also has a 3600 million loan facility which, if drawn, would act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the valuations on the effect of exchange rate uctuations on the value of shareholders funds, the results of which are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Equity Hypothetical value shareholders value 10% writefunds 10% uplift down millions millions millions 31 December 2006 Equity shareholders funds 1,154.1 1,257.8 1,050.4 Change in valuation 9.0% -9.0% 31 December 2005 Equity shareholders funds 902.4 973.0 831.7 Change in valuation 7.8% -7.8% All investments are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Quoted companies are valued based on market prices and recently acquired unquoted investments may be carried at cost.
For such investments, a 10% movement in the valuation basis will have a 10% impact on fair value.
For unquoted investments valued on a different basis, such as earnings-related, a 10% movement in the earnings of the investee company will not necessarily result in a 10% change in fair value, because of other factors such as the level of debt.
Commitment liquidity risk The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 19.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had significant uncalled commitments of 1,840.3 million 2005: 364.1 million, compared to Shareholders funds of 1,154.1 million 2005: 903.0 million.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, commitments would be nanced by distributions received on the realisation of existing investments.
In addition, the Group had a 3600 million loan facility at the year-end that could be drawn on to meet commitments as they fall due.
However, a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor under the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly reviewing cash ow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Investment Committee and approved by the Board.
Valuation market price risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 28 and 29 and a detailed analysis of the 20 largest underlying companies is given on pages 22 to 25.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 54 to 57, all underlying investments are valued at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the current International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC Valuation Guidelines.
The IPEVC Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
It should be noted that a large proportion of the Companys underlying investee companies are expected to be unquoted and therefore the valuation of such companies involves exercising judgement.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in levels of borrowing and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
At 31 December 2006, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss, would result in an 8% change in shareholders funds.
SVG Capital plc SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial information Annual Report and Accounts 2006 78 Notes to the accounts continued 32 Risk continued A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the valuations of the 20 largest underlying investee companies, which had an aggregate valuation before providing for carried interest of 836.9 million or 80.2% of the gross private equity portfolio valuation 2005: 550.2 million or 81.5%, the results of which are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical fair value fair value 10% writeFair value 10% uplift down millions millions millions 31 December 2006 Valuation of 20 largest investee companies 836.9 972.6 691.4 Change in valuation 16.2% -17.4% 31 December 2005 Valuation of 20 largest investee companies 550.2 633.4 466.5 Change in valuation 15.5% -15.2% All investments are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular funds.
In a majority of the funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding duciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
Concentration risk The Directors believe that the diversied nature of the underlying investments in the Companys private equity fund portfolio reduces the risks normally associated with making investments in the buy-out and development capital markets.
However, it should be noted that, in accordance with its stated investment objective, the Company intends to focus its investments principally in private equity funds that are managed or advised by Permira.
As outlined in note 8, the future performance of the Company will therefore be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest see notes 19 and 33 for an indication of the Companys exposures.
The Directors believe that this represents an opportunity, but investors should also be aware that greater concentration of the investment portfolio also presents a risk.
