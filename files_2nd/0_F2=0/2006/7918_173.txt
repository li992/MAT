Notes relating to the summary financial statement 1 Basis of presentation of financial information This consolidated summary financial statement has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Accounting Standards IAS and related IFRIC interpretations in issue, that have been endorsed by the European Commission and are effective at 31 December 2006, or which ICI has chosen to adopt early at 31 December 2006 adopted IFRS.
This is the Groups second consolidated summary financial statement in accordance with adopted IFRS.
The Groups transition date to IFRS was 1 January 2004.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease came into effect from 1 January 2006 and provides guidance on whether complex arrangements include a lease.
As a result of this requirement, certain arrangements have required reclassification as leases.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, this has resulted in additional assets of 13m being recognised on the balance sheet at 1 January 2005, offset by the recognition of associated finance lease creditors of 17m, which are included within net debt.
As a consequence, net assets at 1 January 2005 were restated from 310 m to 314 m. Net debt at 1 January 2005 has been restated from 989m to 1,006m.
Equity at 1 January 2005 has been restated from 247 m to 251 m. Operating profit for 2005 has increased slightly but has been offset by a similar increase in the net finance expense, consequently, profit before taxation for 2005 is unchanged.

The National Starch business, previously reported as one segment, is now reported as four segments: Adhesives, Specialty Starches, Specialty Polymers and Electronic Materials.
This change reflects a move to global business units during 2006.
Information is also provided for the entirety of the National Starch business as it is an important part of the organisation.
Current and prior year segment information has been updated for the change.
The other reporting segments within continuing operations are Paints and Regional and Industrial and, within discontinued operations, Uniqema, which was divested in September 2006 and Quest, the disposal of which was announced in November 2006.
Corporate and other represents the shared costs that are not directly attributable to individual segments.
