23 Explanation of the transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements presented under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 March 2005.
As IFRS comparative figures must be prepared for the year ended 31 March 2005, the date of transition to IFRS was 1 April 2004.
Reconciliation of equity at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 and profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 reported under IFRS and UK GAAP were published in the Groups Interim Accounts and are also available on the Groups website, www.
IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards requires an explanation of major adjustments to cash flows under IFRS.
Whilst the format of the cash flow statement is different from UK GAAP, there are no material changes to Group cash flows.

On payment of a ground rent virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged to the income statement.
b A proposed dividend is not accrued, but is accounted for only when approved.
Dividends are not shown on the face of the income statement.
c The net liabilities of the pension fund and their associated deferred tax are brought onto the Group balance sheet, and any movements therein are shown as a cost or income in the income statement, save for actuarial gains or losses, which are taken directly to retained earnings.
d Contingent capital gains tax on investment property, based on the tax which may arise on the sale of the property, is included in the balance sheet as a deferred tax provision, and any movement from year to year is charged to the income statement within the tax charge.
e A convertible bond is partly carried as debt, based on the net present value of future cash flows and prevailing interest rates at the time of issue, and the balance carried as equity within an equity reserve.
Over the term of the loan, the liability is increased to the nominal value of the debt by charges to the income statement.
f The fair value of all derivatives is recorded in the balance sheet.
The movement in the fair value is taken to reserves if the hedge is effective, or otherwise to the income statement.
g Revaluation surpluses or deficits of investment property and investment property under development are taken to the income statement.
Revaluation gains and losses on development properties are taken to the revaluation reserve, unless the valuation falls below cost, in which case they are charged to the income statement: any subsequent reversal of this loss will be credited to the income statement.
h Rent free periods are amortised over the lease term.
The associated debtor is added to the cost of investment property rather than being carried separately, but as it does not add to the value of the property, it reduces the valuation surplus taken through the income statement.
i Under IFRS the estimated fair value of share awards needs to be assessed at grant and charged to the income statement with any associated deferred tax over the performance period, as adjusted by changes in the number of shares expected to vest at the end of the vesting period.
