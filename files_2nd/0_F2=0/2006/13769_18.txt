It will be paid on 9 March 2007 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 9 February 2007.
6 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 22, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
At 30 September 2006, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per-share number of Per-share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 152.5 1,290.8 11.81 132.3 1,283.3 10.31 Effect of dilutive securities Options 8.9 6.4 Diluted EPS 152.5 1,299.7 11.73 132.3 1,289.7 10.26 The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 p66 EPS Non GAAP measure 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per-share number of Per-share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 152.5 1,290.8 11.81 132.3 1,283.3 10.31 Non EBITA items: Intangible asset amortisation and 13.5 2.8 net development expenditure Taxation 4.1 0.5 Net EBITA adjustments 9.4 2.3 EBITA adjusted Basic EPS 161.9 1,290.8 12.54 134.6 1,283.3 10.49 Effect of dilutive securities Options 8.9 6.4 EBITA adjusted Diluted EPS 161.9 1,299.7 12.46 134.6 1,289.7 10.44 7 GOODWILL 2006 2005 Note m m Cost At 1 October 1,076.8 995.8 Additions 26 n 503.4 65.8 Deferred tax on intangible assets 17 25.8 - Disposals 26 j 7.4 - Exchange adjustments 36.7 15.2 At 30 September 1,561.9 1,076.8 Aggregate impairment At 30 September - - Net book amount at 30 September 1,561.9 1,076.8 Details of acquisitions and disposals in the year are shown in note 26.
During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review, goodwill has been valued on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant cash-generating unit.
Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs.
CGUs represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 p67 Notes to the Accounts - Group continued For the year ended 30 September 2006 7 GOODWILL continued The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date by geographic area: 2006 2005 m m UK 152.6 151.9 France 161.2 68.9 Germany 20.4 6.4 Switzerland 22.5 20.1 Poland 6.2 6.0 Spain 91.6 84.5 North America 1,045.5 685.4 South Africa 25.1 26.8 Australia 25.0 26.8 Asia 11.8 - 1,561.9 1,076.8 The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In all cases, the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The approved cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks specific to the CGU.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGU's operations is primarily based on past performance.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs was in the range of 18% 2005: 18% to 54% 2005: 40%.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken and were in the range of 1.0% 2005: 1.0% to 5.0% 2005: 5.0%.
Goodwill impairment tests were conducted separately for each CGU.
Intangible assets apart from internally generated IPR&D and computer software relate to identifiable assets purchased as part of the Groups business combinations.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straightline basis over their expected useful economic life.

Bank loans are denominated in a number of currencies and bear interest based on LIBOR or foreign equivalents appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred.
Included in loans above is 660.9m 2005: 174.6m of unsecured loans after unamortised issue costs taken out in connection with acquisitions.
This is drawn down under 850.0m multi-currency revolving credit facilities, 650.0m expiring on 4 August 2011 and 200.0m expiring on 15 January 2011.
In the table above, loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of 1.7m 2005: 0.6m.
The Group has incurred total issue costs of 7.1m 2005: 4.9m in respect of these facilities.
These costs are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Unsecured borrowings were drawn in the following currencies: US Dollar 549.2m 2005: 122.3m, Euro 106.5m 2005: 43.4m and Swiss Franc 5.5m 2005: 9.2m and bear interest at a rate of 0.45% 2005: 0.5% above LIBOR.
16 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Numerical financial instruments disclosures are set out below.
Additional disclosures are set out in the accounting policies relating to risk management and also in note 25.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has US Dollar, Euro and Swiss Franc denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US, France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland.
The fair value of the US Dollar borrowings at 30 September 2006 was 549.2m 2005: 122.3m, the Euro borrowings 106.3m 2005: 43.0m and Swiss Franc borrowings 5.5m 2005: 9.2m.
The foreign exchange gain of 12.8m 2005: loss of 1.8m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate to book value.
Fair values of financial instruments For the following financial assets and liabilities: long-term borrowings, short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, shortterm deposits and cash at bank and in hand, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the instrument bearing interest at market rates and or the short-term nature of the instrument.

A reconciliation of share movements for options granted after 7 November 2002 to which IFRS 2 is applicable is shown below.
ESOS Under the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, grants are made at an exercise price which approximates to the share price at the date of the grant and are made to senior executives and managers across the Group, as well as to other staff with high potential or to recognise significant achievement or local market practice.
The annual grant is normally made after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
Under the rules of the ESOS, as amended at the Annual General Meeting in 2005, the annual grant of options to an individual is limited to shares worth up to 300% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares under option worth 100% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 p76 The performance targets governing the vesting of options are based on stretching EPS growth measured over a fixed three year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds Retail Prices Index RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options will vest on a straight-line basis.
If those targets are not met at the end of the three year period, then no further retesting of the performance criteria will be undertaken and the options will lapse.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 p77 Notes to the Accounts - Group continued For the year ended 30 September 2006 19 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued The Sage Group PSP The Performance Share Plan the Plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2005.
Annual grants of performance shares will normally be made to executive directors and senior executives across the Group after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
This Plan is operated in conjunction with the ESOS.
Annual awards under the Plan are limited to shares worth up to 150% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares worth 100% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance shares are subject to performance conditions measuring the Groups total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of international software and computer services companies.
TSR has been chosen as the performance condition because it helps to align the interests of award holders with shareholders and complements the focus on Group financial results that arises from using EPS under the ESOS and annual bonus plan.
The comparator group for awards made in 2005 comprised the following companies: Blackbaud Exact Microsoft Oracle Business Objects GEAC Misys Salesforce.
com Cap Gemini Intuit MYOB SAP Cegid iSOFT Northgate Information Systems Systems Union 30% of shares vest for median TSR performance as compared to the comparator group whilst all shares vest for upper quintile top 20% TSR performance.
Between those two points, shares will vest on a straight-line basis.
TSR will be measured over a single three year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made to establish whether the criteria have been met and if these criteria are not met on the third anniversary of grant, the performance shares will lapse.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The fair value per award granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: March May January Grant date 2005 2005 2006 Share price at grant date 2.07 2.07 2.59 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 0.00 Number of employees 21 6 97 Shares under award 1,841,204 242,626 2,469,883 Vesting period years 33 3 Expected volatility 44% 42% 32% Award life years 33 3 Expected life years 33 3 Risk free rate 4.7% 4.3% 4.2% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 0% 0% 0% Expectation of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% Fair value per award 1.385 1.341 1.401 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.

The acquisition of the Shares was funded by the proceeds of a savings account with a bank or building society.
The original scheme adopted in 1996 continued in accordance with its terms for 10 years and expired in February 2006.
A new scheme was approved by the members at the Annual General Meeting held on 2 March 2006.
Eligibility All UK employees, including executive directors, of the Company and its participating subsidiaries who have completed at least one years continuous service and are assessable to employment income tax are eligible to participate in the SAYE Plan.
