The impact of this in 2006 is to reduce profit in UK home credit by 12.0m and reduce the interest cost held centrally by 12.0m.
2005 results have been restated onto a comparable basis resulting in a reduction in UK home credit profit in 2005 of 16.3m and a reduction in the interest cost held centrally of 16.3m.
These changes have no impact on reported group profits in either 2006 or 2005.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations as defined in IFRS 5.
Consistent with the treatment in the 2005 financial statements, the Yes Car Credit operation has been classified as part of continuing operations on the basis that revenue and impairment will continue to be generated from the loan book until it has been fully collected out.
As announced on 17 January 2007, the group is progressing the sale of the motor insurance business.
Discussions with potential acquirers are proceeding satisfactorily and the board expects to complete the sale of the business before the proposed demerger becomes effective.
As at the group balance sheet date, the motor insurance business did not meet the IFRS 5 criteria of an asset held for resale and, therefore, the business has been classified as part of continuing operations.
Revenue between business segments is not considered to be material.
