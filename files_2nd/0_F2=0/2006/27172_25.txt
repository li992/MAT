Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation For the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2006 the Company had the option to prepare its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 'IFRS', as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board 'IASB'.
The Board has elected to continue to adopt UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 'UK GAAP' and therefore with the new Financial Reporting Standards issued as part of the programme to converge UK GAAP with IFRS.
"The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice for ""Financial Statements for Investment Trust Companies"" the SORP issued in December 2005. b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis."
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to their circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged to the income statement.
Expenses are charged against revenue except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are charged to the capital account in the Income Statement: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
The performance fee has been charged 100% to realised capital reserves.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Company's status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Income Statement on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Company's effective rate of tax for the year.
Murray International Trust PLC 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued e Investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchange's electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the unrealised capital reserve.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of the net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Translation of all other foreign currency balances including foreign assets and foreign liabilities is at the middle rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as capital gain or loss to capital or revenue within the Income Statement depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.
h Derivative financial instruments Financial derivatives are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, for the purpose of managing currency and market risks arising from the Company's activities.
The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement, ii interest rate risk, iii liquidity risk, iv foreign currency risk, and v credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Manager's policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude short-term debtors and creditors, other than for currency disclosures.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Company's operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Board's policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 20, both act to reduce market price risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
58 Murray International Trust PLC Interest rate risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise fixed rate, revolving, and uncommitted facilities.
The fixed rate Yen facilities are used to finance opportunities at low rates and, the revolving and uncommitted facilities to provide flexibility in the short-term.
Current guidelines state that the total borrowings will not exceed 30 per cent of the net assets of the Company.
Details of borrowings at the 31 December 2006 are shown in note 13 on page 56.

The weighted average interest rate on bank loans is based on the interest rate payable, weighted by the total value of the loans.
The maturity dates of the Company's loans are shown in note 13 to the financial statements.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Maturity profile The interest rate profile of the Company's financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Within Within Within Within Within More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total At 31 December 2006 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Fixed rate Bonds 5,431 12,040 11,383 10,366 11,401 27,050 77,671 Non-cumulative Preference shares 9,964 9,964 5,431 12,040 11,383 10,366 11,401 37,014 87,635 Within Within Within Within Within More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Floating rate Cash 3,870 3,870 Within Within Within Within Within More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total At 31 December 2005 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 Fixed rate Bonds 9,911 4,971 12,363 9,191 9,576 29,133 75,145 Non-cumulative Preference shares 10,154 10,154 9,911 4,971 12,363 9,191 9,576 39,287 85,299 Floating rate Cash 6,816 6,816 60 Murray International Trust PLC Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The fair value of borrowings has been calculated at 73,720,241 as at 31 December 2006 2005 85,014,000 compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of 72,159,000 2005 82,803,000 note 13.
The fair value of each loan is determined by aggregating the expected future cash flows for that loan discounted at a rate comprising the borrower's margin plus an average of market rates applicable to loans of a similar period of time and currency.
All other assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Liquidity risk The Company's assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities note 13.
Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Company's investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Balance Sheet can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
It is not the Company's policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
A significant proportion of the Company's borrowings, as detailed in note 13 on page 56, are in foreign currency as at 31 December 2006.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to currency movements on borrowings by using forward foreign currency contracts as a hedge against potential foreign currency movements.
At 31 December 2006 the Company had foreign currency contracts, details of which are listed on page 62.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Credit risk The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
The Company expects to place any deposits on a short term basis only.
