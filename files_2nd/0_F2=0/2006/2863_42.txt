17 Business combinations 2006 acquisitions The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2006, which are shown in aggregate below: Fair value Fair value Book values adjustments to Group m m m Intangible assets 8.7 8.7 Property, plant and equipment 3.2 0.9 2.3 Deferred tax 1.2 1.2 Debtors 5.4 0.4 5.0 Cash and short term deposits 1.0 1.0 Creditors 6.5 1.0 7.5 Obligations under finance leases 0.7 0.7 Provisions 0.3 0.3 Long term debt 2.7 2.7 Corporation tax 0.5 0.5 Net assets 0.1 6.4 6.5 Goodwill arising on acquisition 27.6 34.1 Discharged by: Cash 34.1 During the year deferred consideration of 3.5m was paid in respect of acquisitions made in prior years, of which 3.5m had been provided: there was no impact on goodwill.
Deferred consideration which is expected to be paid has been accrued in respect of acquisitions made in the current and prior years amounting to 9.1m.
The impact of this is to increase goodwill by the same amount.
As required by IAS 12 deferred taxation is calculated on intangible assets recognised as a result of an acquisition, the impact of this was to increase goodwill in 2006 by 2.6m and to create a deferred tax liability of the same amount.
As a result of the above, total goodwill of 39.3m was recognised in the year.
Acquisitions in the year included Sinclair Henderson group of companies, Ruddle Wilkinson Limited, Synaptics Services Limited, Webline Limited, Stirling Trustees Limited and Two Ten Communications Limited.
The performance of these acquisitions post their inclusion in the Group cannot be ascertained as they have been fully integrated within existing offerings.
Within goodwill are certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquirees and could not be measured reliably.
These items include customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
In February 2007 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Harry Weeks Travel & Leisure Group Limited for a consideration of 21m, with a further 12m payable over the next 4 years subject to the business achieving certain performance targets.

The book and fair values of the assets acquired are disclosed in the tables below: Fair value Fair value Book values adjustments to Group BDML m m m Intangible assets 12.9 12.9 Property, plant and equipment 0.8 0.1 0.7 Deferred tax 1.0 1.0 Debtors 38.0 38.0 Cash and short term deposits 0.3 0.3 Creditors 40.3 0.3 40.6 Corporation tax 0.3 0.3 Net assets 0.1 12.5 12.6 Goodwill arising on acquisition 13.4 26.0 Discharged by: Cash 25.7 Associated costs settled in cash 0.3 26.0 BDML, includes BDML Connect Limited, an insurance intermediary and agent, that offers instalment debt facilities to its insurance customers and a specialist in pet insurance and policy administration.
The Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of BDML on 25 July 2005.
From the date of acquisition to the comparative year end BDML contributed 1.1m to the net profit after tax of the Group.
Had the combination taken place at the beginning of 2005, the profit after tax of the Group would have been 107.9m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been 1,443.7m in the comparative year.
Included within goodwill on acquisition were certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquiree and could not be measured.
These included customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
The acquisition of BDML included insurance debtors subject to a securitisation agreement.
The purpose of this arrangement is to securitise customer receivables, derived through the provision of instalment credit facilities to insurance customers of the company.
The company sells said receivables, with no immediate effect on the income statement, for cash to a third party Gresham in this case.
Gresham takes on the rights and responsibilities of these receivables such that the terms of this agreement dictate that Gresham has no recourse to BDML beyond 14% of the total receivable securitised.
