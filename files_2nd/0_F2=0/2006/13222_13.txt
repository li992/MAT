The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The revaluation reserve arose on the restatement of the assets and liabilities of the UK associate to fair value at the time of the acquisition of the outstanding 58% interest see note 25.
Other reserves include 29.2 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken in 2003, partly offset by 6.5 million relating to merger reserves and 0.1 million to the redemption of preference shares.
b During the year ended 31 December 2005 the Group acquired the minority interest of subsidiaries in South Africa and Italy.
c On 28 June 2006 the Group executed a court order granting the cancellation of the share premium account under a Scheme of Arrangement.
The effect of this was to increase by the same amount the distributable reserves for the Group.
The cancellation was undertaken in the books of Regus Group plc where the share premium was held.
Details of the Scheme of Arrangement were contained within the notice of the AGM dated 3 April 2006.
