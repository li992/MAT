The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 have an exercise price in the range of 9.1 pence to 130.6 pence and a weighted contractual life of 2.7 years.
All share options are settled in equity.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to those grants in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
On 1 July 2006 options over 6,973,750 ordinary shares of 5p were granted pursuant to the 1998 Pendragon Sharesave Scheme at an exercise price of 130.6p per share.
The grants of share options under the 1989 and 1999 Schemes prescribed an earnings per share performance criterion.
It is a pre-condition to the exercise of grants made under the 1989 and 1999 Schemes that the growth in the company's earnings per share over the prescribed three year period must exceed by at least 3 per cent per annum for 1999 scheme and 2 percent per annum for the 1989 scheme compound the annual rate of inflation as shown by the RPI Index.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in the year was 25.7 pence 2005 : 63.0 pence.
The vesting conditions attaching to the 1998 Pendragon Sharesave schemes are that the option holder must be employed by the group on the date of exercise.
All options are settled by physical delivery of shares.
70 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 27 Employee benefits continued The fair value of services received in return for share options is measured by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received in respect of share option and share save schemes is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The estimate of the fair value of services received in respect of the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP see Directors Renumeration Report is measured using a stochastic model which incorporates the discount factor required for the total shareholder return performance condition.
The weighted average fair value of the options at the date of grant for those that are outstanding at 31 December 2006 is 19.2 pence 2005: 6.0 pence.
There were no executive share options granted during 2006 to any team members.
The average assumptions input into the models for options granted under the share save schemes and LTIP in the year were as follows: Share save scheme Long term incentive plan 2006 2005 2006 2005 Number of share options granted in year 6,973,750 10,345,235 1,502,525 - Weighted average share price pence 130.6 60.4 1.21 - Weighted average exercise price pence 130.6 60.4 - - Expected volatility % 32.8% 31.7% 33.5% - Expected life years 4.4 4.1 3.0 - Risk free rate % 4.7% 4.0% 4.7% - Expected dividend yield % 2.6% 5.1% 2.2% - Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group's share price over the corresponding historical period.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and team member turnover.
The group recognised a total expense of 0.9m 2005 : 0.4m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions, of which 0.3m 2005: nil was in respect of the LTIP.
The note has been restated following the subdivision of the ordinary shares of 25p each into five new ordinary shares of 5p each.
Pension obligations The group operates seven defined benefit pension schemes four of which have defined contribution sections which closed to future benefits from 30 September 2006 and employees were offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The asset values shown do not include those of the defined contribution sections.

The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible acturial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The IAS assumptions have been updated at 31 December 2006 and differ from those used for the earlier independent statutory actuarial valuations explained above.
