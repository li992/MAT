UK GAAP recognises a charge based on the intrinsic value of any such award at the date of issue, where intrinsic value is defined as being the difference between the fair value of an equity share at the date of issue of the award and any exercise price payable in respect of the award.

Any current tax credits that relates to additional Schedule 3 deductions that exceed Software development costs the IFRS charge in the income statement should be recognised directly in equity.
For the year ended 30 November 005 an adjustment of 3. m was booked, of which 3. m was due to the change in the treatment of current tax which has Under UK GAAP, the costs of developing software were written off to the profit and loss account in the year in which they been taken directly to equity.

The following are the most significant consequent of 4,000, offset by 38,000 of amortisation of amounts capitalised.
