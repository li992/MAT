14 Financial instruments Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage foreign currency, liquidity and interest rate risks.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the executive directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and suitable credit rating.
The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Groups policy is to limit the translation exposure and resulting impact on shareholders equity by borrowing and or using forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the translation exposure in those countries in which the Group has significant net assets.
At 31 December 2006 there were no material currency exposures after accounting for the effect of the hedging transactions.
Throughout the year the Groups borrowings were primarily held in sterling and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on consolidation on the translation of the income statement from the respective functional currencies into sterling.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are limited.
However where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on cash and derivative financial instruments is limited because the Group restricts its dealings to counterparties with high credit ratings.
The credit risk policy specifies the maximum permitted exposure to each counterparty.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
The Group is funded by multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups bankers and US dollar bonds.
During the year a US dollar bond of $385.0m was issued in five tranches with maturities ranging from 2009 to 2018.
At 31 December 2006 the total US dollar bonds outstanding were $535.0m with maturities ranging from 2008 to 2018.
The bank facilities have tenures ranging from one to six years and mature between 2007 and 2011.
At 31 December 2006 the available bank facilities totalled 665.0m of which 175.5m was drawn down.
In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
The maturity of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2006 2005 m m Within one year 28.2 69.5 After one year but within two years 67.7 1.0 After two years but within three years 26.9 60.7 After three years but within four years 161.7 After four years but within five years 42.5 246.6 After five years 158.1 31.4 485.1 409.2 Loans are drawn for various periods at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.
At 31 December 2006 and at 31 December 2005 there were no loans secured by either fixed or floating charges on assets of the relevant companies.

The US dollar bonds have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps for which fair value hedge accounting is applied.
Interest rate caps are in place to reduce the Groups floating rate exposure to movements in LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps have a notional principal of 247.4m outstanding at 31 December 2006 2005: 101.7m.
The floating interest rate is based on US dollar LIBOR repricing every three months.
Financial liabilities with a notional principal of 156.5m were capped at 31 December 2006 2005: 211.1m.
The interest rate is based on US dollar and euro LIBOR repricing every three months.
Hedge accounting is not applied to interest rate caps under IAS 39.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has US dollar denominated borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts.
Some of these have been designated as hedges of its net investments in its foreign subsidiaries.
