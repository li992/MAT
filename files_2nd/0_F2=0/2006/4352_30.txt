The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges or cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be designated and documented at its inception and throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period when the net investment is sold or when the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur.
Fair value hedges The Companys policy is to use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the profit and loss account for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item, to the extent the hedge is effective.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The Companys policy with respect to hedging the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment is to designate it as a cash flow hedge.
If a hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged item affects the profit and loss account.
