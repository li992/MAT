Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 1 Accounting policies i Basis of preparation The financial information in this report has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the UK as well as those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Use of adjusted measures To help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance, items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items and excluded from adjusted earnings per share.
Adjusted earnings per share also excludes foreign currency exchange differences on the retranslation of intercompany loans, which are determined by reference to movements in exchange rates.
These amounts are likely to be volatile and are unrelated to underlying performance.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The application of accounting principles requires the Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
On an ongoing basis, estimates are evaluated using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS.
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
Critical accounting policies Certain of the Groups accounting policies have been identified as critical accounting policies, as these policies involve particularly complex or subjective decisions or assessments.
Estimated fixed asset economic lives The reported amounts for amortisation of intangible fixed assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment can be materially affected by the judgements exercised in determining their estimated economic lives.
Intangible asset amortisation and depreciation of property, plant and equipment for continuing operations amounted to 1.9 million and 13.5 million respectively in 2006 and 1.2 million and 14.7 million respectively in 2005.
Provisions Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement.
These include provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liabilities and legal and environmental claims.
Calculations of these provisions are based on estimated cash flows relating to these costs, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material.
The total costs and timing of cash flows relating to legal and environmental claims are based on management estimates supported by the use of external consultants.
At 31 December 2006 provisions amounted to 50.9 million 2005: 40.7 million.
Tax estimates The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect.
The determination of appropriate provisions for taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Groups ability to utilise tax benefits through future earnings and tax planning.
These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events.
Changes to accounting standards Amendments to published standards effective in 2006 The amendment to IAS 19 Employee benefits is mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
This amendment introduces the option of an alternative recognition approach for actuarial gains and losses.
It may impose additional recognition requirements for multi-employer plans where insufficient information is available to apply defined benefit accounting.
It also adds new disclosure requirements.
The Group has not changed its accounting policy adopted for recognition of actuarial gains and losses and in 2006 an additional liability of 0.2 million has been recognised in respect of the Groups multi-employer plans.
The required additional disclosures of information about plan assets and liabilities and the assumptions underlying the components of the defined benefit cost have been included for both 2006 and 2005.
56 Charter plc Annual Report 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2006 but not relevant or have an insignificant impact on the Groups financial statements The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006 but they are not relevant or have an insignificant impact on the Groups financial statements: IAS 21 Amendment, Net investment in a foreign operation: IAS 39 Amendment, Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions: IAS 39 Amendment, The fair value option: IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Amendment, Financial guarantee contracts: IFRS 1, Amendment, First-time adoption of international financial reporting standards and IFRS 6, Amendment, exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources: IFRS 6, Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources: IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease: IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds: and IFRIC 6, Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market Waste electrical and electronic equipment.
Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted: IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
IFRIC 8 requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
The Group will apply IFRIC 8 from 1 January 2007, but it is not expected to have any significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
IFRIC 10 prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date.
The Group will apply IFRIC 10 from 1 January 2007 but it is not expected to have any significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
New accounting standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following new accounting standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted, are as follows: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, introduces new disclosures about financial instruments.
It requires the disclosure of information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk.
It replaces the disclosure requirements in IAS 32.
IAS 1 amendment Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures introduces disclosures about the level of an entitys capital and how it manages capital.
ii Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity.
A shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus the costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired, including all separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible asset since 1 January 1998 see Goodwill below.
Where additional shareholdings in associate entities are acquired any fair value adjustments related to the shareholdings prior to the increase are taken directly to equity.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups share of its associates post acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that took place before 1 January 2004. iii Segmental reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other business segments.
Segmental assets comprise total assets excluding income tax assets.
Segmental liabilities comprise total liabilities excluding income tax liabilities and borrowings other than bank overdrafts.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Charter plc Annual Report 2006 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued iv Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
The results and net assets of all Group companies that have non-sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows: a Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date: b Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period: and c All resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
v Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, are used as hedges in the financing and financial risk management of the Group and are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement together with any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
For net investment hedges gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
vi Property, plant and equipment The Groups policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004.
These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1.
In accordance with the benchmark treatment under IFRS, borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment are not capitalised.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method spreading the difference between cost and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 30-50 years Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years Vehicles 5 years IT equipment 3-5 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
A review of useful lives of plant, machinery and equipment was performed during the year.
This resulted in a reduction of the depreciation charge of 1.6 million for the year, which is expected to recur over the remaining life of the plant, machinery and equipment.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount see viii Impairment of assets below.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
58 Charter plc Annual Report 2006 1 Accounting policies continued vii Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary or associate acquired.
Goodwill represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Groups previous accounting policy together with additional amounts arising since that date is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates in relation to associates.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years or included as part of the carrying value of associates.
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
b Research and development Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible assets, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between three and ten years.
c Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the licence, usually between 3 and 5 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, except costs directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than 3 years.
d Intangibles arising on acquisitions In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how.
All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives, usually between 3 and 10 years.
viii Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
ix Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO basis or the average cost basis.
Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
x Assets held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from the date of classification.
xi Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Amounts due after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified in the balance sheet as non-current.
xii Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
xiii Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
xiv Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Charter plc Annual Report 2006 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued xv Taxation Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred taxation.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity including share-based payments see xvii Share-based payments below, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
xvi Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar post-employment benefits principally healthcare under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
As permitted under IFRS 1 all actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised for each plan.
To the extent that cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 January 2004 exceed 10 per cent of the higher of plan assets or liabilities as at the end of the previous year, this excess is normally amortised in the income statement over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
Otherwise, the accumulated actuarial gains and losses are not recognised.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, interest on plan liabilities, the expected return on plan assets, past service cost, the impact of any settlements or curtailments and actuarial gains or losses to the extent they are recognised.
For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other defined benefit post-employment obligations, principally post-employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting methodology to that for defined benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can benefit in future, for example, by refunds or a reduction in contributions.
xvii Share-based payments The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
Taxation attributable to the fair value of employee service is taken to equity.
The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash-settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date, with changes recognised in the income statement.
For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
xviii Government grants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
xix Provisions Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised.
Incurred but not reported IBNR amounts are included in provisions.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
60 Charter plc Annual Report 2006 1 Accounting policies continued xx Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed during the year in respect of construction contracts.
Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intra-group sales, is recognised as follows: a Sales of goods and services The majority of the Groups revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a Group entity has fulfilled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration.
In respect of the sale of goods this is usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
b Construction contracts Revenue is recognised by a Group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer.
The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable.
Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
xxi Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
xxii Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the period when paid or, if earlier, in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Charter plc Annual Report 2006 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Segment analysis Primary reporting format business segments The Group is organised into two principal businesses, ESAB welding, cutting and automation and Howden air and gas handling.
For the purposes of IAS 14 Segment reporting, ESAB is split into two segments: i welding and ii cutting and automation.
Inter segmental revenue is not significant.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 1,101,560 2005: 2,208,746 dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the potentially issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
To help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans including attributable tax are excluded from the calculations of adjusted earnings per share as set out in the following table.
It should be noted that the term adjusted is not defined under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts.
Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates of up to 5 per cent.
This does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows were 9.2 to 22.0 per cent 2005: 11.6 to 20.5 per cent.
Other intangible assets have finite lives, over which the assets are amortised.
The amortisation periods are set out in the accounting policies on page 59.
Amortisation has been included in the income statement as follows: Computer software Development costs Total 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m m m Cost of sales 0.3 0.5 0.6 0.2 0.9 0.7 Selling and distribution costs 0.1 0.1 Administrative expenses 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.1 0.9 0.5 Total 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.3 1.9 1.2 Development costs are amortised once the asset is brought into use.

This is expected to result in cash expenditure in the next 12 months.
The remaining provisions in this category are expected to be utilised over the next one to two years.
ii Warranty and product liability provisions relate to continuing businesses and are expected to be utilised over a period of one to two years dependent on the warranty period provided but will also be replaced by comparable amounts as they are utilised.
iii Provision has been made for the probable exposure arising from legal and environmental claims and disputes, both existing and threatened, in some cases arising from warranties given on disposal of businesses.
Provisions have been made representing the best estimate of the outcome of the claims including costs before taking account of insurance recoveries.
Where the outcome of a claim is uncertain the legal costs of defence have been provided for to the extent that they are reliably measurable.
Where appropriate insurance recoveries are recognised in receivables.
At 31 December 2006 these amounted to 6.9 million 2005: 1.7 million.
Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely when these provisions will be utilised though most are expected to be utilised over the short to medium-term with utilisation in the next year expected to be in the region of 10 million before taking account of insurance recoveries.

The Group also provides post-employment medical benefits in the United States.
In accordance with the transitional rules in IFRS 1 all cumulative surpluses and deficits were recognised in the balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Subsequent to that date IAS 19 allows a smoothing approach in which some of the movement in surpluses and deficits is deferred and recognised over time commencing in the following accounting period the corridor approach.
Any surplus or deficit arising as a consequence of actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 January 2004 is not fully recognised in the balance sheet.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States post-employment medical benefit liabilities are assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2006 2005 UK Overseas UK Overseas %% %% Discount rate 5.10 5.50 4.70 5.30 Inflation rate 3.10 2.50 2.85 2.50 Expected return on plan assets equities 7.90 8.90 7.50 8.90 bonds 4.70 5.50 4.50 5.30 property 7.40 7.00 other 5.25 5.40 4.50 6.00 total 6.40 7.20 5.90 7.20 Future salary increases 3.50 3.70 3.10 3.60 Future pension increases 3.20 2.10 3.00 2.30 Medical costs inflation ultimate rate 5.00 5.00 The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on the PA92 standard mortality tables after retirement with allowance for future mortality improvements and scheme specific factors.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 25 years 2005: 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 28 years 2005: 27 years after retirement if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States.
The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived from the RP-2000 table.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 22 years 2005: 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years 2005: 24 years after retirement if they are female.
Mortality assumptions for schemes in Sweden and Germany have been derived from the P94 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.
76 Charter plc Annual Report 2006 20 Retirement benefit obligations continued The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term results for the various asset classes.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience.
A 1% increase in the inflation assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by 0.2 million and the liability by 1.9 million.
A 1% decrease in the inflation assumption on medical costs would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by 0.2 million and the liability by 1.8 million.

In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks, liquidity risks and balance sheet foreign exchange translation risks of the Group.
Foreign exchange transaction exposures are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries within strict guidelines and controls established by their divisional management and overseen by Charter treasury.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge profit and loss account translation exposure.
b Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mix of equity and borrowings.
Borrowings are made in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
It is the Groups objective to minimise the cost of borrowings whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities.
When considered appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
c Currency risks The Group has significant investments in overseas operations.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the Groups balance sheet.
In certain circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet exposures.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge currency flows within its operating units.
The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate.
Until the underlying hedged item affects the consolidated income statement, the revaluation gains and losses arising from such hedges are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity to the extent that they are effective.
The ineffective portion of any hedge is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair values of short-term deposits and borrowings approximate to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.

These lawsuits have alleged that the Charter defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter.
Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in Charter's favour either at trial or on appeal.
In subsequent years, Charter and its subsidiaries have continued to be named in asbestos-related lawsuits.
Charter has contested these actions and, in most cases, has obtained dismissals.
Charter has settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against Charter are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs.
The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages, which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charters operating profits in 2006 were negligible.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
ii Air and gas handling Howden Buffalo Inc. an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United States.
On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it.
Over the past few years, Howden Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 7,781 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 228 cases.
These cases were all settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial.
Howden Buffalo has received legal advice indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought.
At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost of the settlements have been covered by applicable insurance.
The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos-related lawsuits against Howden Buffalo, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden Buffalo known as Buffalo Forge Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance.
The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
82 Charter plc Annual Report 2006 26 Contingent liabilities continued iii Welding The ESAB Group Inc. EGI, an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables.
Other current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various trade associations, including the American Welding Society, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Ferroalloys Association, and others.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts.
A multi-district litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and co-ordinate pre-trial proceedings in the federal court cases.
Last year, EGI was a defendant in two trials in the federal court involving three claimants.
The juries found for the defence and against each claimant.
No further trials are currently scheduled in the federal court.
EGI was also a defendant in three state trials, each involving one claimant.
All of these trials resulted in defence verdicts.
Over 15 state court trials, most involving EGI, are scheduled for 2007, but it is not anticipated that they will all begin as scheduled.
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGIs counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously.
The defence costs, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$16 million, which is reflected in EGIs balance sheet at 31 December 2006.
In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charters financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege asbestosinduced personal injuries.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts from EGI, other welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products.
Several cases are listed for trial this year: however, EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant.
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGIs insurers.
