FAIR VALUE NET GAINS The fair value net gain of 2.5m 2005: nil represents the accounting volatility on derivative instruments which are matching risk exposure on an economic basis.
Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The gain is primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.
