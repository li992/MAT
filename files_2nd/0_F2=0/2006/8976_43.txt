F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S K A Z AK HM YS PLC 101 ANNUAL REPORT 2 0 0 6 12. iNcOme tax continued Details of the Groups tax losses are as follows: i Germany MKM has corporate income tax losses at 31 December 2006 that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits, subject to restrictions set out under German tax legislation.
There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses.
Due to the past history of tax losses, there is insufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise against which the losses can be offset.
For these reasons no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Refer to note 33 c for further details.
ii United Kingdom The payment of the dividends from Kazakhmys LLC to the Company has created excess foreign tax credits of $12.4 million 2005: $5.4 million which have arisen due to the higher effective tax rate in Kazakhstan compared to the UK.
These excess foreign tax credits do not expire.
d uNRECoGNISEd dEFERREd TAx LIAbILITy The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of the distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The gross temporary differences in respect of the undistributed reserves of Kazakhmys LLC, as shown in its statutory accounts prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in Kazakhstan, are as follows: $ million 2006 2005 Undistributed reserves of Kazakhmys LLC 1,165.5 1,248.9 13. earNiNgs per share The earnings per share EPS calculation has assumed that the number of ordinary shares issued pursuant to share exchange agreements in relation to the acquisition of Kazakhmys LLC have been in issue from 1 January 2005 consistent with the pooling of interests method used to account for combinations of businesses under common control.
The EPS calculation has also assumed that the share split that occurred on 23 September 2005, in which the Companys share capital was redenominated into ordinary shares of 20 pence each, was in effect for all prior periods.
The Directors believe that this basis for the EPS calculation provides a more relevant performance measure for the Group than using an EPS calculation which reflected shares issued based on the actual date of issue.
a bASIC ANd dILuTEd EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding during the year.
