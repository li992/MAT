For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of dilutive share options.
During the year the Company paid an exceptional dividend of 68.3m and at the same time carried out a consolidation of its share capital.
These transactions were conditional on each other.
They were specifically designed to achieve the same overall effect on the Companys capital structure as a buy back of shares in a way in which all shareholders could participate.
Accordingly, earnings per share is presented on the basis that in substance a share buy back has occurred.

For all other intangible assets an impairment test is performed whenever an indicator of impairment exists.
In the year ended 25 March 2006, no impairment charges were recognised.
The estimates of recoverable amount were based on value-in-use calculations, using a post-tax discount rate of 10.0 per cent.
These calculations use cash flow projections covering a five year period based on the financial budget for 2006 2007.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated assuming a growth rate of 3 per cent.
The growth rate used does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the manufacturing business in which the CGU operates.
The discount rates used are post-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.

Gains and losses on cash management swaps are included in the consolidated income statement.
The net principal amounts outstanding under cash management currency swaps are US Dollars 15.1 m, Euro 23.9 m, Swedish Krona 412.5m, Swiss Francs 3.0 m, Canadian Dollars 0.7 m, Japanese Yen 65 m and South African Rand 13.1 m.

Financial Risk Management Financial Risk Factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and fair value interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
a Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar, Euro, Swedish Krona and the UK Pound.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign currency by using external forward foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
For segment reporting purposes, each subsidiary designates contracts with Group Treasury as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, as appropriate.
External forward foreign exchange contracts are designated at Group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The Groups risk management policy is to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent to 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months.
Forecast transactions must be highly probable for hedge accounting purposes.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
65 fide La Rue Annual Report 2006 15 Derivative Financial Instruments continued b Credit Risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
An analysis of net assets per geographical region is shown in Note 2 to the accounts.
c Liquidity Risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
d Cash Flow and Fair Value Interest Rate Risk fide La Rues interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises principally from cash balances held.
Current low levels of borrowings are all at floating rate.
At higher levels of borrowings the policy is to manage the interest rate exposure through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
e Commodity Price Risk The Groups normal policy is to buy commodities at prevailing market prices under medium term supply contracts.
The Group has limited exposure to commodity price risk through the purchase of energy products.
Fair Value Estimation The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
In estimating fair values the Group makes assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The nominal value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.

This rate is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zerocoupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The rate applied during the year was in the region of 4.3 per cent to 4.6 per cent depending on exact grant date.
Early exercise has been modelled assuming 10 per cent of option holders leave each year after vesting and that 50 per cent of remaining option holders will exercise per year subject to a minimum acceptable gain.
This is consistent with actual exercise patterns.
Reconciliations of option movements over the year to 25 March 2006 for each class of options are shown below.
The weighted average share price during the year was 416.71p.
Executive Share Option Plan The Executive Share Option Plan is open to senior executives around the Group.
Options are granted at a price equal to the average market price of a share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant with a performance condition based on the achievement of an earnings per share growth target.
The performance condition relates to the achievement over three years of at least 3.0 per cent per annum earnings per share growth over the rate of increase in the retail price index.
If this condition is not met at the end of the performance period the options will lapse.
For grants of options before April 2004 retesting of the performance target will be allowed twice, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
A pre vesting forfeiture rate of 5.0 per cent per annum has been assumed.

The performance condition that has been applied to the 1997 grant and to all subsequent grants of options up to and including 2001 is that options can only be exercised if the total return of a share over a consecutive three-year period exceeds the total return of the median ranked company in the FTSE Mid-250 Index over the same period.
Options granted in 1996 are normally exercisable only if the total return of a share over a rolling three-year period exceeds the average total return of the FTSE All Share Index.

Deferred Bonus and Matching Share Plan The plan is open to senior executives around the Group.
The plan is a combination of three elements: deferred allocation, dividend allocation and matching allocation.
The matching allocation is linked to the deferred allocation and is subject to the following performance conditions: up to 50.0 per cent of the award is released subject to an earnings per share test and up to 50.0 per cent of the remaining matching allocation is based on fide La Rues total shareholder return TSR compared against the companies in the FTSE Mid 250 excluding investment trusts.
The performance conditions are described in more detail on page 40.

84 fide La Rue Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Accounts continued 29 Reconciliation of Net Assets and Profit Under UK GAAP to IFRS continued Explanation of Reconciling Items Between UK GAAP and IFRS a The Group has previously accounted for the defined benefit pension schemes in line with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
Full FRS 17 disclosures have been made in the consolidated financial statements.
IAS 19 is broadly similar to FRS 17 in that the standard requires the net valuation of the Groups defined benefit scheme to be reflected on the balance sheet and prescribes certain assumptions as to the valuation of liabilities.
These differ from those used under SSAP 24 and in general represent a significantly more prudent valuation assuming investment returns are restricted to prescribed bond yields.
The charge to the income statement comprises of an operating charge and a finance charge within interest the latter representing the difference between the expected return on assets and the interest on scheme liabilities.
The balance sheet provision is shown gross of the related deferred tax asset.
The operating charge for 2004 2005 has decreased by 0.4m with a beneficial impact of 1.5m to finance costs, giving rise to an overall increase in profit before tax of 1.9m.
b Under IFRS 2 a charge is required for all share-based payments including share options.
The charge in the profit and loss account is based on the fair value of options at grant date.
The Group has not previously recognised any expense under UK GAAP as intrinsic value was immaterial.
In the year ended 26 March 2005, a charge of 1.4m 2.2m after taxation was required under IFRS 2.
There is no impact on net assets.
c Goodwill is no longer subject to annual amortisation under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Instead, goodwill will be subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently where any indication of impairment exists.
Under UK GAAP goodwill was capitalised and amortised over an appropriate period, not exceeding 20 years.
The Group has elected to apply the IFRS 1 optional exemption to not apply IFRS 3 retrospectively.
Consequently the net book value of goodwill as at 27 March 2004 becomes the deemed cost upon transition to IFRS.
Negative goodwill shown within intangible assets of 0.8m in the published March 2004 balance sheet has been credited directly to reserves in the transitional IFRS balance sheet as negative goodwill is not permitted under IFRS 3.
In line with IFRS 3, the UK GAAP amortisation charge has been reversed in the restated financial information, which has resulted in an increase to profits of 1.4m for 2004 2005.
The exceptional charge of 11.5m within the UK GAAP financial statements relates to an impairment charge and is therefore unchanged by the application of IFRS.
d IAS 38 Intangible assets requires that development costs meeting certain criteria are capitalised and amortised over an appropriate period.
Under UK GAAP fide La Rue has historically expensed all research and development expenditure in the year in which it is incurred.
In accordance with IAS 38, at 26 March 2005, development assets with a net book of 6.6m have been capitalised, which has uplifted net assets accordingly.
During 2004 2005 2.6m of costs were capitalised, offset by an amortisation charge for the year of 1.5m.
e Under IFRS, capitalised software costs which are not an integral part of the associated hardware are required to be classified as intangible assets.
The Group has previously capitalised eligible software costs within tangible fixed assets.
The impact is the reclassification of software assets with a net book value of 2.6m from tangible fixed assets to intangible assets as at March 2005.
The amortisation policy in respect of these assets is unchanged.
f Under UK Company law, companies were required to provide for their final dividend in their closing balance sheet and in advance of the dividend being declared and approved at the Annual General Meeting.
IAS 10 Post balance sheet events does not allow dividends declared after the balance sheet date to be recognised as a liability at the period end as they do not meet the definition of a present obligation as set out by IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
The final dividends for the years ended 27 March 2004 and 26 March 2005 have been reversed and recognised as paid during the following period.
The result is an increase in net assets of 17.7m at 27 March 2004 and 19.0m at 26 March 2005. g IFRS 1 First-time adoption on International Financial Reporting Standards permits fair value to be used as deemed cost for any individual item of property, plant or equipment at the date of transition to IFRS.
Following a review of our property portfolio a downward adjustment of 3.3m has been made to the transitional balance sheet at 27 March 2004.
This reflects the fair value of certain properties as valued by an external independent valuer as at that date.
85 fide La Rue Annual Report 2006 29 Reconciliation of Net Assets and Profit Under UK GAAP to IFRS continued Explanation of reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS continued h Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date and which could give rise to a future obligation to pay more or less tax.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their accounting carrying value under IAS 12 Income taxes.
The current tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet are unaffected by IFRS as the tax payable was based on the relevant local GAAP accounts.
With the exception of current tax relief on share based payments, which has been recognised in equity, the current tax charge in the income statement has been unaffected by IFRS.
Various deferred tax adjustments have been made in line with other IFRS adjustments, the most significant being the recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes.
i In accordance with IAS 39, derivatives held by the entity have to be carried at fair value with movements in the fair value being taken to the income statement or currency reserves dependent on instrument classification.
An asset of 2.1m and a liability of 1.1m were recognised at March 2005 in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts held exclusively as cash flow hedges.
The Group also holds some foreign exchange swaps some of which are designated as hedges of net investments and others which are measured at fair value though profit and loss.
A liability of 0.5m was recognised on adoption of IAS 39 at March 2005.
A number of embedded derivatives were identified in respect of contracts not in the functional currency of the Group or the counterparty.
At March 2005 embedded derivative assets and liabilities of 0.5m and 0.2m respectively were recognised in accordance with IAS 39.
In addition, 1.0m of closing exchange rate to forward exchange rate adjustments made under UK GAAP have been reversed to comply with IAS 39. j Under UK GAAP various cash and borrowings were offset for disclosure purposes.
IAS 32 restricts the circumstances in which cash and borrowings can be offset and hence both balances have been grossed up by 237.2m at March 2005. k As a result of showing discontinued operations as required by IFRS 5, revenue in the year ended 26 March 2005 was reduced by 23.1m, operating costs by 24.7m, pre-tax profits by 8.7m and taxation by 1.8m.
Discontinued operations are shown in one line in the Group income statement.
l A change to the way in which the share of associates profits is presented on the face of the income statement is required by IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, the share of associates profits is shown gross of tax, with associates tax disclosed as part of the overall tax charge.
IFRS requires that the share of associates profits is disclosed net of tax within Group operating profit.
This has the impact of reducing profit before tax by 3.0m, with no consequent change to profit after tax or earnings.
m Upon the adoption of IAS 32 0.3m of other investments are reclassified as available for sale financial assets.
