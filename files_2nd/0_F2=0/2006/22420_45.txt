A Brief History The Company was formed as City of London Brewery Company Limited in 1860 to acquire Calverts, a family brewing business at Upper Thames Street in the City of London.

In 1932 the name was changed to The City of London Brewery and Investment Trust Limited, parts of the business having been sold and the proceeds invested in securities according to investment trust principles.
In 1968 the remaining part of the brewery business was sold and the Company concentrated exclusively on investments in securities.
In 1970 the Company appointed Touche, Remnant & Co. as Investment Manager and in 1982 the name was changed to TR City of London Trust PLC.
