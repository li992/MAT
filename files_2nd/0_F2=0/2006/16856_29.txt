VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 VTG011 R&A 2006 p107-IBC 13 6 06 14:27 Page 121 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Presentation of the financial statements Description of business VT Group plc is the parent company of the VT Group which is engaged in Support Services and Shipbuilding.
2 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the companys financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles.
121 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention.
The company is exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1, paragraph 5a, from the requirement to publish its own cash flow statement, as its cashflows are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the group.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption available under FRS 8 not to disclose details of transactions with other group undertakings as the consolidated financial statements are shown on pages 68 to 119.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that in the opinion of the directors, there is a reasonable probability that the asset will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Dividends paid and received Dividends paid and received are included in the accounts in the period in which the related dividends are actually paid or received.
Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less any provisions for impairment in value.
Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight line basis over the expected useful life as follows: Computer software 3 - 5 years Share based payments The Accounting Standards Board ASB issued Financial Reporting Standard FRS 20 Share Based Payments in April 2004.
Although the company does not incur a charge under this standard, the issuance by the company to its subsidiaries of a grant over the companys options, represents additional capital contributions by the company in its subsidiaries.
An additional investment in subsidiaries results with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity.
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the grant issued allocated over the underlying grants vesting period.
Events after the balance sheet date The ASB issued FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date in May 2004.
This standard replaced Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 17 Accounting for post balance sheet events and the main effect of this change is to prohibit the recording of a provision for a proposed dividend where the dividend is declared after the balance sheet date.
FRS 21 is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2005.
Therefore final dividends are now only recognised in the profit and loss account when shareholders have approved such amount and interim dividends are only recognised when paid.
3 Profit and loss account disclosures The company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The company profit on ordinary activities after tax was 15.4m 2005: 16.2m restated.
The company audit fee was 15,000 2005: 14,000. Dividend disclosures are provided in note 13 of the VT Group plc consolidated accounts.
