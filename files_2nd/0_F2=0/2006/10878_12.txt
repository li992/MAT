Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Statements 1.
Adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 and presentation of net debt at 1 April 2005 a Adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 On 1 April 2005 National Grid Gas adopted IAS 39 and IAS 32.
IAS 39 requires certain financial instruments to be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value rather than historical cost.
Note 18 contains the disclosures required by IAS 39, IAS 32 and IFRS 7.
The principal effect of the adoption of these standards at 1 April 2005 is to record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet at their fair value, while deferred gains and losses relating to items qualifying for hedge accounting are derecognised and instead recorded in equity for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or by adjusting the carrying value of the hedged financial instrument for fair value hedges.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 and the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 have not been restated to reflect the adoption of IAS 39 and IAS 32 on 1 April 2005. b Effect of IAS 39 on net debt and net assets The following table shows the impact of adopting IAS 39 and the total net debt and net assets included in these regulatory accounting statements.
The impact on net debt by business is shown in note 26 a and the impact on net assets by business in note 25.

The impact on other assets and liabilities principally relates to the deferred tax effect of these adjustments.
ii Up to 31 March 2005, deferred gains and losses relating to hedged financial instruments were carried forward in the balance sheet and reflected in the income statement in line with those hedged financial instruments.
Under IAS 39, deferred gains and losses relating to qualifying hedge relationships are recorded in equity for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or by adjusting the carrying value of the hedged financial instrument for fair value hedges or in the income statement if hedge accounting is not achieved.
iii Up to 31 March 2005, accrued interest was presented separately within creditors from the financial instruments to which it relates.
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39 the carrying value of borrowings and derivative financial assets and liabilities includes the related accrued interest balance.

Directors emoluments The businesses reported in these regulatory accounting statements are not entities with statutory Directors.
Accordingly, there are no relevant Directors emoluments.
Details of the emoluments of the Directors of National Grid Gas are provided in the Directors report on page 20.
Pensions Substantially all National Grid Gass employees are members of the defined benefit section of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme formerly named the Lattice Group Pension Scheme the scheme.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to National Grid Gas.
Accordingly, National Grid Gas accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Pension scheme The scheme provides final salary defined benefits for employees who joined prior to 31 March 2002 and defined contribution benefits for employees joining from 1 April 2002.
The scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
It is subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contribution, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The latest full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2006 is currently being carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP.
The last completed full actuarial valuation was as at 31 March 2003.
The projected unit method was used and the principal actuarial assumptions adopted were that the annual rate of inflation would be 2.5% and that future real increases in pensionable earnings would be 1.5%.
Investments held in respect of pensions before they become payable would average 5.05% real annual rate of return and investments held in respect of pensions after they become payable would average 2.7% real rate of return and that pensions would increase at a real annual rate of 0.05%.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was 10,141m and the value of the assets represented approximately 92% of the actuarial value of benefits due to members calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2003 on an ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.
The results of the actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2003 showed that based on long-term financial assumptions the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 23.7% of pensionable earnings 20.7% employers and 3% employees.
This contribution rate is currently being reviewed.
The ongoing contribution rate does not include an allowance for administration expenses.
These contributions are renewed annually.
From 1 April 2006 the rate used for the recovery of administration costs was 3% of salary.
Employers are currently, therefore, paying a total contribution rate of 23.7%.
It has been agreed that no funding of the deficit identified in the 2003 actuarial valuation will need to be provided to the scheme until the outcome of an actuarial valuation at 31 March 2007 is known.
At this point, National Grid will pay the gross amount of any deficit up to a maximum amount of 520m 364m net of tax into the scheme.
The Groups share of these payments would be 468m 328m net of tax.
Until the 31 March 2007, actuarial valuation has been completed, National Grid has arranged for banks to provide the trustees of the scheme with letters of credit.
The main conditions under which these letters of credit could be drawn relate to events which would imperil the interests of the scheme, such as National Grid Gas plc becoming insolvent or National Grid failing to make agreed payments into the fund.
The following disclosures relate to the scheme as a whole and include amounts not recognised in these regulatory accounting statements, but which are recognised in the accounts of Lattice Group plc.

ii A promotional age related scale has been used where appropriate.
iii The assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the plan.
The expected real returns on specific asset classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from the schemes actuaries.
The long-term target asset allocation for the scheme is 40% equities, 52% bonds and 8% property and other.

Financial Instruments The following information on financial instruments largely comprises a simple apportionment of such information in respect of National Grid Gas plc and reported in that companys annual report and accounts.
Accordingly, other than the analysis of book and fair values of financial instruments at 31 March, disclosures are only provided in total and not by regulatory business.
National Grid Gass treasury policy, described in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 11 to 13, includes details of the objectives, policies and strategies of the Group associated with financial instruments.
National Grid Gass counterparty exposure under derivative financial contracts at 31 March 2006 and attributed to the businesses reported in these regulatory accounting statements was 102m 2005: 54m.
National Grid Gas had no significant exposure to either individual counterparties or geographical groups of counterparties at 31 March 2006.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Due to their short maturities, the fair value of short-term receivables and payables approximates to their book value.

Financial Instruments continued Sensitivity analysis at 31 March 2006 Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2006.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 March 2006 and is not representative of the year then ended as all of these varied during the course of 2005 06.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments, as debt and deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt: changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Using the above assumptions, a - 0.10% movement in UK interest rates would affect the income statement by 6m, but would not impact on equity.
Derivative financial instruments National Grid Gass hedging policies are set out on pages 12 and 13.
National Grid Gas has entered into a number of derivative financial instruments as detailed below, which are designated as follows: Fair value hedges National Grid Gas maintains interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by National Grid Gas.
Change in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the income statement within interest expense and other finance costs.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within net losses gains on derivative financial instruments.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement within interest expense and other finance costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount is amortised to the income statement under the effective interest rate method.
Cash flow hedges National Grid Gas maintains interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps that qualify for hedge accounting as designated cash flow hedges relating to future interest payments on debt.
The revaluation of these swaps is included in the cash flow hedge reserve and is recycled to the income statement as the interest charge relating to the debt is recorded.
National Grid Gas uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated and committed future purchases.
Where designated, these contracts qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges.
When the underlying purchase is recorded, the associated gains and losses deferred in equity are removed and included in the initial cost of the asset.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship National Grid Gass policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39 some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is appropriate.
56 National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory Accounting Statements 2005 06 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Statements Continued 17.
Financial Instruments continued Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement within net losses gains on derivative financial instruments.

Provisions continued Provisions are analysed between current and non-current as follows: North East of West North West England Midlands London Meter fide-minimis Other DN DN DN DN Metering Reading activities activities Total m m m m m m m m m At 31 March 2006 Current 7 8 5 6 -- -- 26 Non-current 19 12 4 13 - - - - 48 26 20 9 19 - - - - 74 At 31 March 2005 Current 25 18 18 20 - - - - 81 Non-current 8 6 5 5 -- -- 24 33 24 23 25 - - - - 105 Environmental provision The environmental provision represents the net present value of the estimated statutory decontamination costs of old gas manufacturing sites owned and managed by National Grid Gas discounted using a nominal rate of 5.25%.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but it is expected to be incurred over the period 2007 to 2057 with some 33% of the spend projected to be spent over the next five years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
National Grid Gas has made its best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2006 relating to gas site decontamination was 72m 2005: 59m, being the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2006, 10m of the total restructuring provision 2005: 16m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, largely to be paid within the next financial year.
