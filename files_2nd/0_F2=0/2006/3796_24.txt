83 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Parent Company financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2006 1 Accounting policies The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below: A Accounting convention and basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP and the Companies Act 1985 using the historical cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
B Exemptions The Companys financial statements are included in the Compass Group PLC consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2006.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from presenting a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing transactions with other members of Compass Group.
The Compass Group PLC consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2006 contain financial instrument disclosures which comply with FRS 25 Financial Instrument: Disclosure and Presentation.
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 not to present separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company.
C Change in accounting policies The Company has applied the following standards for the first time for the year ended 30 September 2006: FRS 17 Retirement benefits FRS 20 Share-based payment FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS 25 Financial instruments Disclosure and presentation FRS 26 Financial instruments Measurement FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
The adoption of each of these standards represents changes in several accounting policies and the comparative amounts have been restated accordingly.
The adoption of FRS 17, FRS 23 and FRS 28 had no effect on the Companys profit or net assets.
Details of the effect of the prior year adjustments are given in note 9.
FRS 20 requires that the fair value of options and shares awarded to employees is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period.
The Company does not incur a charge under this standard.
However, where the Company has granted rights over the Companys shares or share options to the employees of its subsidiary undertakings, an additional capital contribution based on the fair value of the grant spread over the vesting period has been deemed to have been made by the Company to its subsidiary undertakings.
This results in an increase in investment in subsidiaries and a corresponding increase in shareholders equity.
FRS 21 requires that dividends are only recognised at the balance sheet date if they are declared before that date.
Therefore, the final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2004 which was declared in February 2005 is not recognised in the balance sheet at 30 September 2004 resulting in an increase in reserves of 134 million at 30 September 2004.
Similar treatment of the final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2005 has increased reserves at 30 September 2005 by 140 million.
The Company has adopted the presentation requirements of FRS 25.
This deals with the classification of capital instruments issued between debt and equity.
FRS 26 prescribes new accounting rules relating to financial instruments and hedge accounting.
This standard has been adopted in full in these financial statements.
D Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
In the opinion of the directors the value of such investments is not less than shown at the balance sheet date.
E Foreign currency Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
F Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost unless they are part of a fair value hedge accounting relationship.
Borrowings that are part of a fair value hedge accounting relationship are measured at amortised cost plus or minus the fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
G Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative instruments utilised include interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Company and Group policy is disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
H Dividends Dividends are recognised in the Companys financial statements in the year in which they are approved in general meeting by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
84 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued I Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided at the anticipated rates on timing differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
J Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using either the binomial distribution or Black-Scholes pricing models as is most appropriate for each scheme.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.
The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions.
An addition to the Companys investment in Group undertakings is reported with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds.
For details of the charge see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
