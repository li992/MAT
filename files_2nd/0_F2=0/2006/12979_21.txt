its transformation into a The $965m 502m sale of Hard Rock, which completed on focused gaming business.
5 March 2007, allows Rank to concentrate its resources fully on the gaming market, where we have an established position.
As a focused gaming business, we expect to play a leading role in the development of the sector, ensuring our products and services respond fully to the opportunities offered by the changing environment.
Deregulation The process of deregulation, engendered by the 2005 Act, brings opportunities for the gaming industry.
At the same time there will be increased responsibility for operators to respect the guiding principles of the new Act to ensure fairness and to protect the young and the vulnerable.
As an established British gaming company, Rank has a track record of responsible operation in bingo, casinos and bookmaking.
In a market evolving in response to societal and regulatory pressures we will do all that we can to maintain our high standards.
The British Government too has a responsibility to ensure fairness in gaming.
We will continue to press both for an equitable tax regime for bingo and for a level playing field in casinos to ensure that existing casinos are not competitively disadvantaged in relation to the 17 new casinos granted under the 2005 Act.
Peter Johnson Chairman There is also a need for fairness and responsibility in the way that deregulation is communicated to the British public by the industry, parliament and the press.
Only through an accurate portrayal of the facts can we form a clear view on the evolution of gaming and the nature of its effects on society.
Board changes On behalf of the Board of Rank I should like to thank Alun Cathcart, who stepped down as Chairman and resigned from Rank on 28 February 2007.
For almost six years, Alun has been one of the principal driving forces behind the Companys transformation from a broad leisure conglomerate to a focused gaming business.
I am sure you will join me in wishing Alun well for the future.

A review of operations A We see exciting long term growth prospects in the UK gaming with Ian Burke market and believe that, with our integrated model of bingo, casino and betting with both retail and on-line distribution, Our focus on mainstream leisure we are well placed to benefit from the predicted increases in consumer spending on mainstream gaming.
gaming is underpinned by a In the short term we recognise that our businesses face a number depth of operating experience of challenges, most notably the smoking ban which will be effective and a portfolio of strategically across the whole of Britain from July this year.
Our strategy is to take vigorous action to meet these challenges while retaining our important assets.
long term focus on the growth opportunities for Rank.
Q During 2006, the Group grew revenue by 3.7% but operating profit was lower than in 2005.
A The reduction in operating profit was due in part to a 4.5m increase in rental costs arising from the 211m sale and leaseback transaction which completed in August 2006.
Adjusting for the increased lease costs and a number of one-time restructuring costs, operating profit for the continuing Group was in line with our performance in 2005.
Q What progress have your businesses made this year?
A The outstanding performance came from our interactive business, Blue Square, which increased operating profit by 680% to 7.8m through tighter margin control and strong revenue growth in its games and poker products.
In Mecca Bingo we have made significant progress in improving the quality of our product, giving our members greater value for their money.
During 2006 we paid out more than 205m in main stage bingo prizes, compared with 187m in 2005.
This approach has been rewarded with an increase in market share Ian Burke Chief Executive and a stemming of admissions decline.
However the impact of the smoking ban in Scotland, in addition to rises in business costs and operating lease payments, has resulted in lower operating profit.
In Grosvenor Casinos we delivered good growth in revenue and a 12.9% rise in operating profit.
This performance was driven by a 3.7% year-on-year increase in admissions and a 1.2% increase in spend per head.
Q What progress have you made in achieving the cost savings that you outlined at the time of your interim results in September?
A During 2006 we undertook a major programme of cost saving initiatives, designed to generate 16m of annual cost savings.
We developed improved club operational models in Mecca Bingo and Grosvenor Casinos, we closed our London head ofce and merged our corporate and Gaming shared service functions, we streamlined our senior management structure and we took steps to improve procurement efficiency.
As a result we expect to achieve 10m of operational cost During 2006 we agreed or completed asset savings in 2007 mainly in Mecca Bingo and to cut 6m from our combined Group and Gaming division costs, on an underlying disposals totalling more than 1.1bn, including basis.
The implementation of these initiatives during 2006 resulted the sales of Deluxe Film, Hard Rock and US in one-off costs of 4.4m in Group overhead and 4.5m in Gaming Holidays.
By the time that the 350m special shared services.

The major negative aspect of the 2005 Act for Rank is the loss We have implemented a broad strategy to counter the negative of Section 21 gaming terminals as a result of the reclassication effects of the smoking ban, including improving facilities for of gaming machines.

Ian Burke Chief Executive A During the year we anticipate spending between 50m and 60m on maintaining and developing our businesses.
The majority of this will be focused on Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca Bingo.
Q What progress have you made in exiting Deluxe Media and US Holidays?
A During 2006 we exited, via a series of disposals, all Deluxe Media Services operations in Europe including the UK.
In addition we reached agreements with our customers to terminate our media replication and distribution services in the USA.
Although there are ongoing lease commitments on a small number of properties in the USA, we anticipate exiting the business within the 56.6m provision established at 31 December 2005.
On 15 December 2006 we completed the sale of US Holidays for $32.6m approximately 16.8m.
