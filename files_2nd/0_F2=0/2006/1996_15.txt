Statement of Directors responsibilities in relation to the financial statements of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc the Company Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985, and for preparing the Remuneration Committee report.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Going concern basis After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Combined Code The Directors consider that the Company applies the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance of the Financial Reporting Council, as described in the Corporate Governance section on pages 42 to 46.
As required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the auditors have considered the Directors statement of compliance in relation to those points of the Combined Code which are specified for their review.
