Notes to the accounts 79 1 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS The impact of new accounting standards and interpretations on BG Groups Financial Statements for 2006 is set out below.
IFRIC Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 4 requires companies to determine whether they have any arrangements which are or contain leases based on an assessment of whether specific assets are required to fulfil each arrangement or whether each arrangement conveys a right of use of the asset.
If an arrangement contains a lease, the requirements of IAS 17, Leases should be applied to the lease element of the arrangement.
BG Group has applied IFRIC 4 from 1 January 2006 and has concluded that the contract for the provision of capacity at Lake Charles contains a finance lease.
Comparative information has been amended to reflect this arrangement.
As at 1 January 2006, borrowings have increased by 283m, property, plant and equipment has increased by 263m, deferred tax assets have increased by 7m and retained earnings have decreased by 13m to reflect this arrangement: comparative information has also been restated.
The effect of this interpretation on operating profit was a 12m increase in 2006 2005 9m: 2004 7m and the effect on finance costs was a 17m increase in 2006 2005 14m: 2004 12m.
The tax effect was a 2m decrease in the tax charge for 2006 2005 2m: 2004 2m resulting in a reduction in the profit for the year of 3m 2005 3m: 2004 3m.
Basic and diluted earnings per share have decreased by 0.1 pence 2005 0.1 pence: 2004 0.1 pence.
IAS 39 Financial Guarantee Contracts and Credit Insurance In August 2005, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 39 which covers the accounting required for financial guarantee contracts that provide payment to be made if a debtor fails to make a payment when due.
These contracts should be initially measured at fair value and subsequently re-measured using the higher of the provision set out in IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or the initial amount less cumulative amortisation in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue.
This amendment is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006 and BG Group has adopted it from that date.
As at 1 January 2006, investments have increased by 5m and provisions for other liabilities and charges have been increased by 5m: comparative information for 2005 has been restated.
Comparative information for 2004 has not been restated as the Group adopted IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 with no retrospective application.
The effect of this amendment on operating profit is nil in 2006 2005 nil.
Finance costs in 2006 have decreased by 1m 2005 2m and share of post tax results from joint ventures and associates has decreased by 1m in 2006 2005 2m.
There was no impact on profit for the year or earnings per share.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The Group will adopt the disclosure requirements in respect of financial instruments set out in IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures in its Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
During 2006 the IASB and IFRIC issued the following standards and interpretations which will be applicable in future years.
In addition, there have been a number of interpretations issued by IFRIC during 2006 which are unlikely to have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments The IASB issued IFRS 8 in November 2006.
It sets out the requirements for disclosure of information about an entitys operating segments and also about the entitys products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates and its major customers.
IFRS 8 achieves convergence with the US accounting standard, FAS 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information with minor differences, and is mandatory in financial statements beginning on or after 1 January 2009 although earlier application is permitted.
This standard has yet to be adopted by the EU and, accordingly, BG Group has continued to apply IAS 14 Segment Reporting in its 2006 Financial Statements.
The application of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the way in which the Group presents its segmental information.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 12 provides guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service concession arrangements.
It is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 although earlier application is permitted.
BG Group is currently reviewing the standard to determine the likely impact on the Group.
This interpretation has yet to be adopted by the EU.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 18 January 2007, BG Group completed the sale of Mauritania Holdings B. V. for a total consideration of 65m see note 6, page 91.
On 2 April 2007, BG Group completed the disposal of some of its Canadian assets for a total consideration of 228m.
Details of business combinations occurring after the balance sheet date are included in note 15, page 98.
In February 2007, the Brindisi LNG site was seized in connection with a criminal investigation by Italian authorities into allegations of improper conduct related to the authorisations process.
Further details of this matter are contained in the Directors report Significant events subsequent to 31 December 2006 page 56.
BG Group has not abandoned the Brindisi project, is actively pursuing the release of the site and continues to target first LNG deliveries to the terminal during 2010.
However, it is unclear at this stage how this investigation and other matters described in the Directors report may affect the project.
Accordingly, in preparing BG Groups 2006 Financial Statements, an impairment provision of 104 million has been established against the cumulative capitalised construction costs of the project.
See notes 6 Disposals, re-measurements and impairments page 91 and 27 Commitments and contingences page 108.
80 Notes to the accounts continued 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION The primary reporting segments for BG Groups operations in 2006 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG, Transmission and Distribution T&D, Power Generation Power and Other activities.
E&P comprises exploration, development, production and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on natural gas.
LNG combines the development and use of LNG import and export facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
T&D develops, owns and operates major pipelines and distribution networks, and supplies natural gas through these to the end customer.
Power develops, owns and operates natural gas-fired power generation plants around the world.
Other activities primarily comprise business development expenditure and corporate costs.
The Group manages its business segments on a global basis.
With effect from March 2006, the Groups Kazakhstan assets were incorporated into the newly created Europe and Central Asia Region, with the remaining assets in the Asia and Middle East region being incorporated into the newly created Asia Pacific region.
Accordingly, most of the operations were managed in five main geographical areas: Europe and Central Asia, South America, Asia Pacific, North America and the Caribbean, and Mediterranean Basin and Africa.
The segmental analysis and results presentation on page 81 including comparative information is aligned with the way the business was managed in 2006.
Intra-group and inter-segment sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties arms length principle.
Group revenue, profit for the year, net assets, gross assets and gross liabilities, depreciation and amortisation and capital investment attributable to BG Group activities are shown on page 81, analysed by business segment and geographical segment.
The presentation of BG Groups results under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS separately identifies the effect of the re-measurement of certain financial instruments and profits and losses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and businesses.
Results excluding disposals, certain re-measurements and impairments Business Performance are presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business Performance is given on page 152.
Disposals, re-measurements and impairments include unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain long-term UK gas sales contracts classified as derivatives under IAS 39, derivatives associated with gas in UK storage and pipeline facilities and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
The separate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance of the business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of the income statement.
It is also relevant to present the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest and tax.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business Performance and operating profit including and excluding the results of joint ventures and associates.
Details of earnings per share including disposals, re-measurements and impairments are given in note 10, page 94.
b Operating profit loss before share of results from joint ventures and associates includes disposals and provisions for impairment of 153 m 2005 446m: 2004 87m, attributable to segments as follows: E&P 67 m 2005 417m: 2004 46m, LNG 69 m 2005 nil: 2004 19m, T&D 1m 2005 61m: 2004 nil, Power nil 2005 nil: 2004 nil and Other activities 18 m 2005 32 m: 2004 22m.
Also included are: i non-cash re-measurements of 404m 2005 240 m: 2004 nil, attributable to segments as follows: E&P 404m 2005 239 m: 2004 nil, LNG nil 2005 1 m: 2004 nil : and ii 113m 2005 70m: 2004 52m of unsuccessful exploration expenditure written off and charged to the E&P segment.

E SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS BG Group has recognised the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees based on grants of options allocated under the Company Share Option Scheme and Sharesave Scheme and shares allocated under the Long Term Incentive Scheme and Free Shares Scheme made since 7 November 2002 the effective date of IFRS 2, Share-based Payment.
BG Group has recognised the fair value of cash-settled share-based payments to employees based on grants of options and shares made both before and after 7 November 2002.
Company Share Option Scheme Details of the Company Share Option Scheme CSOS are given on page 62.
Details of share options held by Executive Directors and the aggregate number of options held by executive officers under the CSOS are given on pages 67 and 57 respectively.
The first grants under the CSOS were made in November 2000.
Further grants have been made in all subsequent years up to and including 2006.
In 2006, grants of 14.8m 2005 16.0m: 2004 16.0m share options were made under the CSOS.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the share options at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the CSOS is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 6.84 2005 5.11: 2004 3.48, exercise price of 6.90 2005 4.99: 2004 3.47, dividend yield of 1.0% 2005 1.0%: 2004 1.0%, volatility of 21% 2005 19%: 2004 22%, a risk-free rate of 4.70% 2005 4.08%: 2004 4.96% and an expected life of five years 2005 five years: 2004 five years.
The average value of share options granted during the year was 1.70 per share 2005 1.21 per share: 2004 0.95 per share.
Expected volatility for the 2006 award was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous five year period.
For awards in prior years, a three year period was used in the absence of data in respect of BG Groups share volatility over a five year period.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Long Term Incentive Scheme Details of the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS are given on page 62.
Details of notional allocations to Executive Directors and the aggregate of the notional allocations to executive officers under the LTIS are given on pages 66 and 57 respectively.
In 2006, notional allocations of 3.6m ordinary shares 2005 6.5m ordinary shares: 2004 5.2m ordinary shares were made under the LTIS.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the shares at the award date, adjusted for the probability of market-related performance conditions being achieved.
In 2006, the charge in respect of the LTIS was 10m 2005 6m: 2004 3m.
88 Notes to the accounts continued 5 DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES continued The fair value of shares allocated during the year in respect of the LTIS is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 6.84 2005 5.11: 2004 3.50, exercise price of nil 2005 nil: 2004 nil, dividend yield of 1.0% 2005 0.8%: 2004 0.9%, a risk-free rate of 5.2% 2005 3.8%: 2004 2.9%, a vesting period of three years 2005 three years: 2004 three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member of the LTIS comparator group as set out on page 62 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
The fair value reflects the probability of market performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year was 4.13 per share 2005 2.20 per share: 2004 1.70 per share.
The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of shares for the LTIS are based on US data because most of the companies in the LTIS comparator group are US based.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth over the previous year.
Sharesave Scheme Details of the Sharesave Scheme are given on page 63.
Details of share options held by Executive Directors and the aggregate number of options held by executive officers under the scheme are given on pages 67 and 57 respectively.
In 2006, grants of 0.7m 2005 0.5m: 2004 1.5m share options were made under the Sharesave Scheme.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the share option at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2006, the charge in respect of the Sharesave Scheme was 1m 2005 0.6m: 2004 0.2m.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the Sharesave Scheme is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 6.84 2005 5.11: 2004 3.49, exercise price of 5.82 2005 3.95: 2004 2.74, dividend yield of 1.0% 2005 1.0%: 2004 1.0%, volatility of 22% 2005 19%: 2004 22%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 4.74% 2005 4.08%: 2004 4.84% and a weighted average expected life of 4.1 years 2005 3.7 years: 2004 3.6 years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 2.11 per share 2005 1.64 per share: 2004 1.17 per share.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three year period.
The expected life used in the model is based on the contractual terms in the Sharesave Schemes.
Share Incentive Plan Details of the BG Group Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 63.
During the year, 0.5m ordinary shares were awarded as Free Shares under the plan 2005 0.8m ordinary shares: 2004 1.0m ordinary shares.
Under IFRS 2 the charge to the income statement in respect of the award is based on the market value of the shares at the grant date.
The fair value of the shares awarded during the year was 7.73 per share 2005 4.19 per share: 2004 3.32 per share.
In 2006, the charge in respect of the SIP was 4m 2005 3m: 2004 3m.
Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments Cash-settled share-based payments arise when the Group incurs a liability to employees to transfer cash amounts that are based on the price or value of the Companys shares.
A charge of 3m has been made in respect of cash-settled CSOS awards 2005 2m: 2004 0.3m the terms of which are the same as the equitysettled CSOS awards and a charge of 10m 2005 12m: 2004 3m has been made in respect of social security costs on employee share option and share schemes.
The charge for cash-settled CSOS awards and social security costs on employee share option and share schemes covers awards made before and after 7 November 2002.
During the vesting period the costs of the cash-settled CSOS awards are charged to the income statement based on the fair value of the share option at the balance sheet date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The fair value of the non-vested cash-settled options at the balance sheet date has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price of 7.03 2005 5.55: 2004 3.54, weighted average exercise price of 4.72 2005 2.87: 2004 2.75, dividend yield of 1.0% 2005 1.0%: 2004 1.0%, volatility of 20.80% 2005 20.00%: 2004 21.63%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 5.09% 2005 4.39%: 2004 4.48% and a weighted average expected life of three years 2005 three years: 2004 four years.
The average fair value of non-vested cash-settled CSOS awards at the balance sheet date was 3.02 2005 2.76: 2004 1.20.
For awards that had vested, but not been exercised at the balance sheet date, the fair value was the intrinsic value of the award at the balance sheet date.
The charge to the income statement in respect of social security costs has been calculated based on the fair value of the awards at the balance sheet date multiplied by the current employers National Insurance rate.
The fair value of the awards that had not vested at the balance sheet date has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo projection model where appropriate.
For CSOS awards the following assumptions were used: share price of 7.03 2005 5.55: 2004 3.54, weighted average exercise price of 5.10 2005 2.87: 2004 2.75, dividend yield of 1.0% 2005 1.0%: 2004 1.0%, volatility of 20.80% 2005 20.00%: 2004 21.63%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 5.08% 2005 4.39%: 2004 4.48% and a weighted average expected life of four years 2005 three years: 2004 four years.
The average fair value of non-vested CSOS awards at the balance sheet date was 2.81 2005 2.76: 2004 1.20.
For the LTIS awards the following assumptions were used: share price of 7.03 2005 5.55: 2004 3.54, volatility of 22.34% 2005 20.00%: 2004 21.63%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 5.20% 2005 4.38%: 2004 4.48%, and a weighted average expected life of two years 2005 two years: 2004 two years.
The average fair value of LTIS awards at the balance sheet date was 3.40 2005 2.47: 2004 1.60.
This is the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
Options can be exercised subject to performance conditions, from the third anniversary of the grant date.

A reconciliation of results before and after disposals, re-measurements and impairments is given in note 2, page 80.

OTHER OPERATING INCOME Re-measurements included within Other operating income amount to a credit of 404m 2005 charge of 240m, 366m of this credit 2005 224m of this charge represents unrealised mark-to-market movements on certain long-term UK gas sales contracts.
Whilst the activity surrounding these contracts involves the physical delivery of gas, the contracts fall within the scope of IAS 39 and meet the definition of a derivative instrument.
The credit in 2006 arose as a result of falling UK gas prices, compared to 2005.
A tax charge of 201m 2005 credit of 96m arose on these re-measurements.
In addition, there is a 61m tax credit relating to the impact of the increase in North Sea taxation on certain re-measurement balances.
Further information on commodity instruments is given in note 21, page 102.
OPERATING COSTS 2006 In February 2007, the Brindisi LNG site was seized in connection with a criminal investigation by Italian authorities into allegations of improper conduct related to the authorisation process.
BG Group has not abandoned the project, is actively pursuing the release of the site and continues to target first LNG deliveries to the terminal during 2010.
Accordingly, the Brindisi asset was subject to an impairment review as a result of the current uncertainties surrounding the project.
The impairment review of the Brindisi regasification plant compared the value in use using a discount rate of 8% with the carrying value of this asset, resulting in an impairment charge of 104 million to operating costs post tax 97 million.
DISPOSAL OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS 2006 In June 2006, BG Group disposed of its interest in Iqara Telecoms India Private Limited, BG Broadband Networks India Private Limited, BG India Telecom Mauritius Limited and Iqara HITS Conditional Access Services India Private Limited.
This resulted in a loss on disposal of 8m.
No tax arose on the disposal.
In November 2006, the Group disposed of its 37.5% interest in Nile Valley Gas Company which resulted in a 1m profit on disposal, and sold two LNG ships, which resulted in a 35m profit on disposal.
No tax arose on these disposals.
In December 2006, the Group committed to a plan to dispose of its interests in its Mauritania Holdings B. V. and Microgen businesses and accordingly reclassified these businesses as held for sale.
As a result, they were revalued to fair value less disposal costs.
Fair value was based on estimated disposal proceeds.
This resulted in a pre-tax charge to the income statement of 77m post-tax charge of 56m, including provision for impairment of 67m.
Mauritania Holdings B. V. was sold in January 2007.
2005 During 2005, BG Group disposed of its 16.67% interest in the North Caspian Sea PSA and received net pre-tax proceeds of 936m, realising a 416m pre-tax and 279m post-tax profit on the disposal.
In addition, the Group disposed of its 50% interest in Premier Transmission Limited to Premier Transmission Financing plc for cash proceeds of 26m, realising a 13m profit on disposal.
92 Notes to the accounts continued 6 DISPOSALS, RE-MEASUREMENTS AND IMPAIRMENTS continued In December 2005, BG Group signed a Master Restructuring Agreement with the other shareholder and creditors of Gas Argentino S. A. GASA, the parent company of MetroGAS S. A. MetroGAS.
This agreement sets out the way in which the debt and equity of the company will be restructured, resulting in a reduction in BG Groups control over GASA and therefore MetroGAS.
Having assessed the status of the transaction and the requirements of IAS 27, BG Group concluded it had lost control of GASA and therefore MetroGAS on signing the agreement and deconsolidated GASA and MetroGAS from that date.
This deconsolidation and reduction in economic interest has resulted in a gain of 56m representing the Groups share of net liabilities deconsolidated and including 6m of translation gains transferred from the translation reserve.
No tax arose on the deconsolidation.
From 31 December 2005 these companies are accounted for under the equity method and recognised at nil value in the Groups Financial Statements.
In December 2005, as a result of the MetroGAS restructuring, BG Group reviewed its planning assumptions associated with its investment in Gasoducto Cruz Del Sur S. A. the Uruguayan pipeline business.
Gas supply and demand uncertainties in Argentina and Uruguay, combined with the reduced presence of BG Group in Argentina and the reduced control of GASA have meant that the value in use of this investment was lower than the carrying amount.
The impairment was calculated by comparing the value in use of the cash-generating unit using a pre-tax discount rate of 8% with the carrying value of the investment.
It resulted in a charge of 8m to the T&D segment and is recognised within the consolidated income statement as part of the profit on disposal of non-current assets and impairments.
The Group also disposed of its 100% interest in BG Telecom Holdings Limitada, Iqara Telecom Limitada, DirectNet Participaes Limitada and DirectNet Prestao fide Servios Limitada for sale proceeds of 11m, realising a loss on disposal of 18m.
No tax arose on the disposals.
In addition, in December 2005, the Groups Indian telecoms businesses were subject to an impairment review as a result of managements decision to make a strategic withdrawal from all of the Groups telecoms businesses.
The assets and liabilities of these businesses were presented as held for sale in the Groups balance sheet and valued at fair value net of disposal costs.
Fair value was based on an indicative offer from a third-party, subject to due diligence, to purchase these businesses.
Accordingly, an impairment charge of 14m was recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the profit on disposal of non-current assets and impairments and recorded against the assets of the telecoms businesses in the Other activities segment.
The sale of these businesses was completed in 2006.
1m profit was recognised following the disposal of BG Groups interest in a North Sea asset.
2004 During 2004, BG Group disposed of its interest in the Muturi Production Sharing Contract and related Tangguh LNG project in Indonesia.
The sale realised proceeds of 142m, resulting in a 66m pre-tax and 38m post-tax profit on the disposal.
In addition, BG Group disposed of its 1.21% holding of shares in a listed company, GAIL India Limited formerly Gas Authority of India Limited.
The sale realised proceeds of 32m resulting in a pre-tax profit on disposal of 22m.
Tax of 2m arose on the profit on disposal, based on the effective rate of capital gains tax in India for long-term investments.
1m of expenditure was incurred relating to a prior year disposal.
FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS Re-measurements presented in finance income and costs relate primarily to certain derivatives used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk, partly offset by foreign exchange movements on certain borrowings in subsidiaries.
In 2005, re-measurements included the retranslation of MetroGAS US Dollar and Euro borrowings which could not be designated as hedges under IAS 39.

Net exchange differences include the retranslation of certain borrowings in subsidiaries.
Certain exposures relating to these borrowings are hedged using interest rate and currency derivative instruments: the net fair value gains and losses on such derivatives are reported separately.
b Other interest income includes interest receivable of 28m in relation to tax settlements.
c Finance costs associated with general borrowings used to finance major capital projects are capitalised up to the point that the project is ready for its intended use.
The weighted average interest cost applicable to these borrowings is 6.5% per annum 2005 5.4%: 2004 2.3%.
d Amount in respect of pension obligation represents the unwinding of discount on the plans liabilities offset by the expected return on the plans assets see note 29, page 111. e Excludes the Groups share of net finance costs from joint ventures and associates of 67m 2005 43m: 2004 34m.

This consists of a tax charge on unrealised re-measurements of 141m 2005 tax credit 96m: 2004 nil and a tax credit on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets of 28m 2005 tax charge 137m: 2004 tax charge 30m.
a The 2006 tax charge incorporates the effect of an increase in supplementary charge on UK North Sea profits from 10% to 20%.
This resulted in a deferred tax charge of 38m to reflect the increased tax rate on accelerated capital allowances and other temporary differences at 1 January 2006 and a deferred tax credit of 61m to reflect the increased tax rate on re-measurement balances at 1 January 2006.
This tax rate increase also led to a 83m increase in the deferred tax charge for the year.
The total tax charge reconciles with the charge calculated using the statutory rates of UK corporation tax as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Restated Restated m m m Profit before taxation UK 1 419 670 605 Overseas 1 866 1 834 889 3 285 2 504 1 494 Tax at UK statutory rates on profit 1 151 735 455 Effect on tax charge of: Non tax-deductible or non-taxable items 78 11 14 Overseas or petroleum revenue taxes at different rates to statutory rates 233 195 66 Effect of increased tax rate on opening balances 23 Prior year and other adjustments including unrelieved overseas tax losses 22 20 48 Tax charge 1 461 939 583 94 Notes to the accounts continued 9 DIVIDENDS 2006 2005 2004 Pence per Pence per Pence per ordinary ordinary ordinary m share m share m share Prior year final dividend, paid in the year 144 4.09 74 2.08 66 1.86 Interim dividend, paid in the year 103 3.00 68 1.91 61 1.73 Total dividend paid in the year 247 7.09 142 3.99 127 3.59 Proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 143 4.20 The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 4.20p takes the 2006 full year dividend to 7.20p per ordinary share.

As at 31 December 2006, the majority of the goodwill recognised related to Comgas, which is classified within the Transmission and Distribution T&D segment and was defined as a cash generating unit CGU for impairment testing purposes.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
No goodwill impairment has been recognised.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from the value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on approved financial plans covering a five year period.
The growth rate assumptions used in the plans were based on past performance and managements expectations of market development.
The annual growth rates in the business plan used to determine cash flows beyond the five year period are between 4% and 12% and do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The projected cash flows were discounted using a nominal rate of 8% to arrive at value in use.
The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects risks relating to the T&D segment.

Details of the assets acquired are as follows: Book value Fair value Fair value at acquisition adjustments at acquisition m m m Assets Non-current: Land and buildings 4 1 5 Plant and machinery 35 4 39 Current: Inventories 1 1 Trade and other receivables 2 2 Net assets 42 5 47 Cash consideration 47 The adjustments relate primarily to, but not limited to, the revaluation of plant and machinery.
The cash consideration of 47m included 1m of costs directly attributable to the combination.
No significant gain or loss has been recognised in the current year in respect of the Dighton acquisition.
Had the acquisition date for this combination been at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that BG Groups consolidated revenue and profit on ordinary activities before taxation would not have been materially different.
On 14 February 2007, the Group acquired the remaining equity 66.3% of Serene S. p. A.
Previously, the Group owned 33.7% of the equity and the company was treated as an investment accounted for under the equity method.
The consideration paid was 80m in cash.
In addition, a further 9m of the consideration payable has been deferred and is subject to regulatory developments in respect of emission allowances.
On 13 March 2007, the Group acquired the Lake Road power plant for 351m in cash.

The disclosure above is presented after the effect of these interest rate swaps.
Further information on the fair value of the interest rate swaps is included in note 21, page 102.
The effective post-swap interest rates as at 31 December 2006 were between 3% and 19% 2005 2% and 19%.
For amounts falling due within one year the effective post-swap interest rates were between 3% and 19% 2005 4% and 19%.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposures of this type in accordance with Treasury policies.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the composition of floating and fixed rate debt.
The Group also manages currency and interest rate exposures by entering into contracts to swap currency principal amounts together with periodic exchanges of interest, which may be on a fixed or floating basis.
Such contracts are referred to as cross-currency interest rate derivatives.
The Groups policy is not to use interest rate, currency exchange rate or cross-currency interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Risk Factors section of the Business Review under Exchange Rate and Financing on pages 42 and 43.
COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain long-term gas sales contracts in the UK have terms within the contract that constitute written options and accordingly they fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts also include pricing terms which are based on a variety of commodities and indices, including oil, electricity and the Retail Prices Index RPI.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
These have all been included within other commodity derivatives in the following tables.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Risk Factors section of the Business Review under Commodity Prices on page 42.
VALUATION The Group calculates the fair value of interest rate and currency exchange rate derivative instruments by using market valuations where available or, where not available, by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The amount for commodity contracts and commodity related derivatives is based on forward price curves, where available.
Where market quoted forward price curves are unavailable the fair value has been determined using quotes from third-parties or the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
One of the assumptions underlying the fair value of long-term commodity contracts is that the gas market in the UK is liquid for two years.
As at 31 December 2006, the average two year forward price for UK gas was 36p per therm 2005 61p per therm.
Beyond this period a seasonally adjusted UK gas price of 31p per therm 2005 31p per therm has been used along with a US$40 per barrel 2005 US$40 per barrel Brent oil price and an electricity price of 28 per megawatt hour 2005 28 per megawatt hour.
The fair values of the long-term commodity contracts are then discounted using a risk-free interest rate of 5% 2005 5%.
Under these assumptions, the change in fair value of commodity contracts credited to the income statement in the year is 366m 2005 224m charge.
As at 31 December 2006, the potential change in the fair value of long-term commodity contracts, assuming a 10% change in the price assumptions, was 30m 2005 90m.

The amounts in respect of other commodity derivatives represent the gross combination of notional principals relating to all purchase and sale contracts.
These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risk that the Group is exposed to from their use.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING In line with the Groups risk management policies, certain derivative and non-derivative instruments are designated as hedges of currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures in accordance with IAS 39.
Further information can be found in the Financial Instruments and Commodity Instruments sections of the Financial Review on pages 35 and 36.
Fair Value Hedges As at 31 December 2006, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The fixed rate loans and the related swaps have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2006 is 3m 2005 20m.
During 2006, adjustments of 16m 2005 2 m have been made to borrowings in respect of highly effective fair value hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts and currency exchange rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales.
The cash flow hedges were assessed as highly effective and an unrealised pre-tax gain of 73m 2005 29m loss was deferred in equity as at 31 December 2006.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within five years 2005 one year following the year end and the associated gains and losses deferred in equity will be released to the income statement as the underlying transaction occurs.
As at 31 December 2006, deferred pre-tax gains of 1m 2005 29m loss are expected to be released to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2006 is 75m 2005 27 m. Note 26, page 107 identifies the amounts that have been transferred from equity to the income statement in respect of transactions completed during the year.
These items are reported within the income statement to match against the underlying transaction.
104 Notes to the accounts continued 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued HEDGE ACCOUNTING continued Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31 December 2006, certain currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of net investments in the Groups foreign operations, and are being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Fair value movements in the designated currency derivatives are transferred to equity to offset the gains and losses arising on the retranslation of the net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax loss on highly effective designated currency derivatives deferred within equity as at 31 December 2006 is 15m 2005 95m.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31 December 2006 is 117m 2005 62m.
FINANCIAL ASSETS EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM DEBTORS The Groups financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents of 1 463m 2005 1 516m, loans made to joint ventures and associates of 591m 2005 550m, other long-term investments of 1m 2005 1m and debtors due after more than one year of 49m 2005 52m.
The currency and interest rate profile of financial assets is as follows: Fixed rate Floating rate Non interest 2006 2005 financial financial bearing Restated assets assets assets Total Total m m m m m Currency: Sterling 95 1 106 88 1 289 1 395 US Dollars 44 638 83 765 626 Other 33 17 50 98 139 1 777 188 2 104 2 119 The effective interest rates on the loans to joint ventures and associates as at 31 December 2006 were between 0% and 9.95% 2005 0% and 9.95%.
Within floating rate financial assets, cash and cash equivalents earn interest at the relevant market rates or, where invested in money market liquidity funds, as determined by the investment returns of the relevant fund.
In each case, investment performance is measured against the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR for the relevant currency and maturity.
Periodic interest rate determinations in respect of other floating rate financial assets generally comprise LIBOR plus or minus an agreed margin.
As at 31 December 2006, 95m 2005 107m of fixed rate loans to joint ventures and associates expire in 2016 2005 expire in 2016 and have effective interest rates of between 7.25% and 9.95% 2005 between 7.25% and 9.95%.
The maturity profile of the remaining loans to joint ventures and associates cannot be practicably estimated as repayments are based on the performance of the individual joint venture or associate.
As at 31 December 2006, 44m 2005 52m of fixed rate debtors due after more than one year expire between 2011 and 2015 2005 expire between 2011 and 2015 and have effective interest rates of between 10.95% and 12.66% 2005 10.95% and 12.66%.

The fair values of the fixed rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans have been estimated based on quoted market prices where available, or discounting by the market curve.
The fair values of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans approximate book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates as repayment of these loans are linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associate and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.
CREDIT RISK As at 31 December 2006, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was 5m 2005 15m, currency derivatives 122m 2005 66m and commodity related derivatives 387m 2005 22m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under short-term debtors and other financial assets are represented by the book values in the above table.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
LIQUIDITY RISK As described in Financing section of the Risk Factors, page 43, the Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures keep liquidity risk low.

The deferred tax liability of 1 146m 2005 733m is shown after the offset of certain deferred tax assets relating to the same fiscal authority: the liability prior to such offset is 1 424m 2005 1 138m.
The net amount expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 1 134m 2005 735m.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1 395m 2005 1 032m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Company had no deferred tax assets or liabilities as at 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2006 1 January 2005 nil.
There were no movements in respect of deferred taxes for the Company during 2005 and 2006.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable income is probable.
The Group has unrecognised deductible temporary differences of 219m 2005 62m and unrecognised tax losses of 210m 2005 116m to carry forward against future taxable income.
To the extent unutilised, 50m of these losses will expire between 2007 and 2011.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 252m 2005 252m : these tax losses can only be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
The Group also has unrecognised overseas tax credits of 159m 2005 137m.

F LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The arbitration of a dispute between First Gas Power Corporation FGPC, in which the Group has a 40% shareholding and Siemens AG, Siemens Power Generation Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd and Siemens Inc. collectively Siemens has been concluded.
The dispute related to Siemens construction for FGPC of the Santa Rita power station.
The dispute arose from delays in project completion for which FGPC claimed liquidated damages of approximately 62m from Siemens, withheld approximately 59m in payments and additionally claimed approximately 47m for defects in the work.
Siemens claimed that FGPC was not entitled to any remedy for the delay in completion of the project and sought payment of the amounts withheld by FGPC and an additional 34m for costs, loss of profit and finance charges arising from the delay.
Following arbitral decisions which were largely favourable to FGPC all outstanding issues between FGPC and Siemens relating to Santa Rita have been finally resolved by a settlement agreement adopted by the tribunal which concluded the arbitration process.
US$94m of liquidated damages were retained by FGPC and Siemens agreed to pay FGPC approximately 5m to settle other cross claims, claims for interest and FGPCs legal costs.
On 12 February 2007, the Court of Brindisi, Italy, announced that it was pursuing a criminal investigation against certain current and former employees and consultants of BG Group and BG Italia S. p. A BG Italia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Group, as well as against BG Italia itself, into allegations of improper conduct related to the authorisation process.
There are various unrelated legal proceedings ongoing relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal, the impact of which cannot yet be quantified.
For further details see Directors report Significant events subsequent to 31 December 2006 page 56 and Risk Factors Brindisi LNG Terminal Investigations page 44.
In addition, various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot readily be foreseen, it is considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as shown in these Financial Statements.

111 29 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme is of the defined benefit type.
It is a registered formerly approved pension scheme established under Trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The Scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the Schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the Scheme.
Employees contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 3% of pensionable pay.
Participating employers contributions, including Scheme expenses, are certified by the Schemes independent qualified actuary.
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the employers contribution rate in respect of most Scheme members was effectively 25.2% of pensionable pay.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2005.
The actuarial valuation showed that the aggregate market value of the Schemes assets at 31 March 2005 was 318m, representing some 91% of the accrued liabilities.
The Group made one payment of 11m in 2006 and intends to make two further payments of 11m in 2007 and 2008 in order to reduce the Schemes deficit.
A new pensions tax regime came into effect in April 2006.
A past service cost of 13m was recognised in the income statement in 2006, reflecting the removal for funding purposes of the earnings cap a legislative cap on the amount of salary that could be used to calculate pensions from a tax approved scheme on members whose salary was expected to exceed it.
In addition, a prior service credit of 6m was recognised in the income statement, reflecting the impact of the changes to the Scheme to allow members to take more of their benefit in the form of a cash lump sum post April 2006.
During the year an initial payment of 4m was made to the Scheme in respect of tax regime changes.
As a result of the new pensions tax regime, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme is available to provide benefits in excess of the new lifetime allowance.
This scheme is an unfunded, unregistered formerly unapproved arrangement.
A subsidiary undertaking operates a defined benefit pension scheme the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme which is closed to new entrants.
The scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
There is an unfunded post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect of employees of Comgas.
Provision has been made in respect of these post-retirement benefits.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes and smaller defined benefit schemes for its local employees in overseas businesses.
These are not material in Group terms.
IFRS The following information in respect of the Scheme, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme, the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme and the Comgas post-retirement healthcare plan described hereafter as the plans has been provided in accordance with IAS 19.
Valuations of all of the plans assets and expected liabilities as at 31 December 2006 were carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19.
In calculating the charge to the income statement including any recognised actuarial gains and losses, a 10% corridor was applied.
This means that a portion of actuarial gains and losses is recognised as income or expense only if it exceeds the greater of: a 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at that date before deducting plan assets : and b 10% of the fair value of any plan assets at that date.
These limits are calculated and applied separately for each defined benefit plan at each balance sheet date and the portion of actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in future years for each plan is the excess of actuarial gains and losses over and above the 10% limits divided by the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in that plan.
The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following assumptions: 2006 2005 2004 Comgas Comgas Comgas healthcare healthcare healthcare BG plans plan BG plans plan BG plans plan % % % % % % a Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.1 5.0 2.9 5.0 2.8 5.0 Future increases in earnings 5.1 n a 4.9 n a 4.8 n a Discount rate 4.9 11.3 4.8 11.3 5.3 11.3 b Healthcare cost trend rate n a 9.2 n a 9.2 n a 9.4 a Rate of increase of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
b The rate for the Comgas healthcare plan is initially at 9.2% trending to 6.8% over 45 years 2005 9.2% trending to 6.8%: 2004 9.4% trending to 6.8%.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BG plans was reduced by 0.1% to 4.8%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 16m and the service cost for 2007 would increase by 2m.
112 Notes to the accounts continued 29 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued In determining the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2006 for the BG plans, mortality assumptions are based on the 1992 mortality series issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to the members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMI Bureaus medium cohort tables.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in 10 years time are as follows: Life expectancy of pensioners years 31 Dec 2006 31 Dec 2016 Male age 60 26.6 27.3 Male age 65 21.8 22.5 Female age 60 29.5 30.2 Female age 65 24.7 25.3 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the defined benefit obligation in respect of the BG plans would increase by 16m and the service cost for 2007 would increase by 1m.
As at 31 December 2006, the value of the plans assets and expected rates of return, together with the liabilities in the plans, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Expected Percentage Expected Percentage Expected Percentage rate of of plans rate of of plans rate of of plans return a assets Value return a assets Value return a assets Value % % m % % m % % m Equities 7.7 64 306 8.0 84 336 8.2 83 258 Absolute return strategies 7.2 20 97 Index-linked gilts 4.3 5 23 4.0 5 19 4.5 5 15 Corporate bonds 5.5 10 49 4.8 10 41 5.2 11 33 Cash 4.1 1 7 3.9 1 4 3.8 1 3 Total market value of assets 482 400 309 Present value of liabilities 727 647 479 Deficit in plans 245 247 170 Unrecognised net loss 78 93 35 Net benefit liability 167 154 135 a Long-term expected rate of return.
The expected rate of return on assets has been determined following advice from the funded plans independent actuary and is based on the expected return on each asset class together with consideration of the long-term asset strategy.
A real return relative to price inflation of 4.6% a premium of 3.4% over the yield on index-linked gilts is expected on equities.
The expected return on absolute return strategies is 0.5% below the equities return.
The overall expected rate of return as at 31 December 2006 was 7.2%.
The actual return on the plans assets was 50m 2005 75m.

The next independent actuarial valuation for the BG Pension Scheme is expected to be undertaken as at 31 March 2008.
Following this valuation, the rate of the employers contributions will be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.
The projected benefit obligation for the Comgas post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare was 33m 2005 35m.
The effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates with all other assumptions remaining constant on the aggregate service and interest costs for the Comgas plan would be an increase of 0.5m or a decrease of 0.4m 2005 0.4m increase or decrease and on the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation would be an increase of 4m 2005 4m or a decrease of 3m 2005 3m.

In determining the projected benefit obligation as at 31 December 2006 for the BG plans, mortality assumptions are based on the 1992 mortality series, issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to the members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMI Bureaus medium cohort tables.
The discount rate is based on the rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent currency and term to the projected benefit obligation.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been determined following advice from the plans independent actuary and is based on the expected return on each asset class together with consideration of the long-term asset strategy.
The percentage of fair value of total assets in the plan for each major category of assets for the BG plans is set out in the IAS 19 disclosure on page 112.
The Trustees of the BG plans are responsible for setting the investment strategy after consultation with the sponsoring company and professional advisers.
The Trustees overall investment objectives are: the acquisition of suitable, appropriately liquid and diversified assets, which together with new contributions from the employers and members will generate returns to meet the cost of current and future benefits provided by the BG plans: to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities over the long-term and to avoid causing excessive volatility in the employers financial position: and to minimise the long-term costs to the BG plans by maximising the return on the assets whilst having regard to the risks identified above.
The following strategic asset allocation has been set by the Trustees of the BG Pension Scheme in order to achieve their objective: UK equities 14%: overseas equities 51%: absolute return strategies 20%: UK index-linked gilts 4.5%: and UK corporate bonds 10.5%.
Assets of the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme are invested in index-linked gilts.

Under IFRS, it is treated as a component of equity.
Accordingly, it constitutes a reconciling item between equity under IFRS and shareholders funds under US GAAP.
b As allowed by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, BG Group has recognised cumulative actuarial gains and losses in respect of the Groups pension and post-retirement benefit plans in full on transition to IFRS.
From 1 January 2003, actuarial gains and losses which exceed the greater of 10% of the plan assets or obligations at the beginning of the financial year are spread over the average remaining service lives of the employees participating in the plan and are reflected in operating profit.
US GAAP has no equivalent to the transition arrangements of IFRS 1.
BG Group has adopted the prospective transition requirements of FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans as at 31 December 2006.
Accordingly, gains and losses that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost have been recognised as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.
The incremental effect of applying FAS 158 has been an increase in the liability for pension benefits of 142m net of minority interest of 4m : an increase in deferred tax assets of 43m net of minority interest of 1m : and a reduction in shareholders funds of 99m net of minority interest of 3m.
The supplementary disclosures required by FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, FAS 132 R, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and FAS 158 are given in note 29, page 114.
The US GAAP pension costs and disclosures incorporate the requirements of FAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits.
c Under US GAAP, in accordance with FAS 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, Comgas BG Groups regulated Brazilian distribution business recognises balances in respect of the pass-through of gas costs in future tariff reviews.
Under IFRS, the retrospective benefits and obligations do not meet the criteria for assets or liabilities.
Accordingly, the movement in the balance and the liability at year end is recognised as a reconciling difference.
120 Notes to the accounts continued 31 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued d In 2000, BG Group received proceeds of 168m in connection with the securitisation of receivables under the Premier Power CCGT transaction.
Under IFRS, this amount was recognised as revenue in the year of receipt, along with the impairment of the property, plant and equipment associated with the original power plants.
US GAAP treats these proceeds as debt, with no impairment of property, plant and equipment.
Under US GAAP, the outstanding debt, as at 31 December 2006, would be 96m, bearing interest at a rate of 7.62% and maturing in March 2012.
The increase in the US GAAP net interest expense and the increase in depreciation from the property, plant and equipment not impaired would be more than offset by increased revenue as the debt is unwound, resulting in the increase to net income.
e BG Group adopted FAS 123 R, Share-Based Payments, on 1 January 2006, with modified prospective application.
Under US GAAP, the cost of awards granted or modified after 1 January 2006 and the unvested portion of awards granted before 1 January 2006 is charged to the income statement over the service period, based on the fair value of the instrument and the likelihood of vesting under the rules of the applicable scheme.
Prior to 1 January 2006, as permitted under FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, BG Group accounted for stock options using the intrinsic accounting method under Accounting Principles Board opinion APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees as clarified by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No.
44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation FIN 44 and FIN 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.
In any ten year period, not more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or issuable under all schemes.
BG Group has elected to use the short cut method under FAS 123 R to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits as of adoption of FAS 123 R. The cumulative impact of the transition from the provisions of FAS 123 in 2006 on income before income taxes and net income are shown on page 118.
Income from continuing operations increased by 1m, basic and diluted EPS did not change.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income under US GAAP in 2006 was 97m 2005 86m: 2004 26m.
The aggregate fair value of shares that vested during the year was 8m 2005 12m: 2004 5m.
Compensation cost capitalised as part of fixed assets was 5m 2005 4m: 2004 2m.
At 31 December 2006, the total compensation cost not yet recognised in respect of non-vested awards was 92m: this is expected to be recognised over a weighted average period of 20 months.
The total income tax benefit recognised in the income statement for share-based compensation arrangements was 20m 2005 26m: 2004 7m.
The tax benefit realised from stock options exercised and shares awarded in the year was 19m.
The total payment made in respect of cash settled share-based awards was 2m 2005 1m: 2004 nil.
In addition, payments have been made of 5m 2005 3m: 2004 nil in respect of social security costs on employee share option and share schemes.
The following table illustrates the effect of the application of FAS 123 R on net income and shareholders funds: Net income Shareholders funds m m US GAAP adjustment at 1 January 2006 prior to FAS 123 R restatement 10 Cumulative effect of the adoption of FAS 123 R 1 45 Social security payments reversal of accrual under IFRS 5 5 Company Share Option Scheme CSOS treated as liability awards under FAS123 R 60 55 a US GAAP adjustment as at 31 December 2006 54 85 a The net income charge of 54m represents an additional 55m charge in the year offset by a 1m credit on transition under FAS 123 R. Details of the BG Group Company Share Option Scheme CSOS are given on page 62.
In any ten year period, not more than 5% of the issued share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under discretionary share option schemes, including the CSOS.
Under IFRS 2, costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the share option at the grant date and the likelihood of options vesting under the scheme: the awards are classified as equity awards.
Under US GAAP from 1 January 2006, CSOS awards are classified as liability awards because the performance condition includes a factor related to the UK Retail Prices Index, which is not considered a market variable.
Costs of the scheme are therefore charged to the income statement based upon the fair value at the balance sheet date, rather than at the grant date.
The fair value of the awards at the balance sheet date was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the same assumptions as those for cash-settled CSOS awards as shown on page 87.
The average fair value of outstanding CSOS share options at the balance sheet date was 3.07 per option.
No fair value has been calculated at the balance sheet date in respect of prior years as these awards were treated as equity under APB 25 and accounted for using grant date intrinsic values.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year under the CSOS was 34m 2005 28m: 2004 3m.
The total intrinsic value of options vested and exercisable as at 31 December 2006 was 79m and the total intrinsic value of options outstanding at 31 December 2006 was 149m.
The weighted average contractual life of exercisable and outstanding options at 31 December 2006 was 5 years and 7 years 8 months respectively.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2006, variable accounting was applied to this scheme and compensation expense, charged to the income statement over the vesting period, was equal to the difference between the market value of the underlying share relating to the option and the exercise price.
At each reporting period, compensation expense was adjusted for changes in the market value of the shares since the grant date.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the CSOS under IFRS 2 is set out on page 87.
The fair value at grant date under FAS 123 R was the same as that under IFRS 2.
Under IFRS 2, BG Group accrues for social security payments on shares and share options over the vesting period and until they are exercised.
US GAAP requires these amounts to be accounted for when paid: therefore, there is a reconciling item within shareholders funds to reverse the IFRS accrual.
121 31 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued Details of the BG Group Sharesave Scheme are given on page 63.
In any five year period, not more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under all-employee share schemes.
Under IFRS 2, costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the share option at the grant date and the likelihood of options vesting under the scheme.
Under US GAAP subsequent to 1 January 2006 a similar treatment is applied.
Prior to 1 January 2006, under APB 25, the 20% discount on the option price compared with the market price on the date of grant was recognised as compensation expense over the saving period, except in certain specified situations where variable accounting was applied under FIN 44.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the Sharesave Scheme under IFRS 2 is set out on page 88.
The fair value under FAS 123 R is the same as that under IFRS 2.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year under the Sharesave Scheme was 6m 2005 1m: 2004 2m.
The total intrinsic value of options vested and exercisable at 31 December 2006 was nil and the total intrinsic value of options outstanding at 31 December was 10m.
The weighted average contractual life of exercisable and outstanding options at 31 December 2006 was 6 months and 2 years 8 months respectively.
Details of the BG Group Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS are given on page 62.
Notional allocations of shares under the LTIS scheme are made each year to eligible employees.
Under IFRS 2, costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the shares at the grant date, which is adjusted for the probability of performance indicators being achieved.
Prior to 1 January 2006, the income statement charge was based upon the likelihood of the shares vesting under the scheme and the current market value of the shares required to fulfil the allocation.
The fair value of shares granted during the year in respect of the LTIS under IFRS 2 is set out on page 88.
The total fair value of shares vested during the year under the LTIS was 4m 2005 9m: 2004 2m.
Details of the BG Group Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 63.
Free Shares awards were made under the SIP in 2006, 2005 and 2004.
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the charge to the income statement in respect of the award is based on the market value of the shares at the grant date.
The fair value of the shares awarded during the year is set out on page 88.
The total fair value of shares awarded and vested during the year under the SIP was 4m 2005 3m: 2004 3m.
BG Group issues shares to satisfy its obligations in respect of options granted under the CSOS and Sharesave Schemes.
BG Group grants shares vesting under the LTIS and SIP schemes out of Treasury shares.
During 2007, BG Group does not expect to repurchase shares in order to satisfy the requirements of the LTIS and SIP schemes.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Group had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation in 2004 and 2005: 2005 2004 m m for the year ended 31 December Net income as reported 1 138 731 Add: charges to net income under APB 25 net of tax 60 19 Deduct: charges determined under the fair value basis of FAS 123 net of tax 21 12 Net income 1 177 738 Earnings per ADS as reported: Basic 1.61 1.03 Diluted 1.60 1.03 Earnings per ADS: Basic 1.66 1.05 Diluted 1.65 1.05 f FAS 143 requires entities to use a credit-adjusted discount rate, and to use the current discount rate each time a new provision is added or an existing provision increased, but not to reassess the discount rate on previously recognised provisions.
By contrast, IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, does not require the discount rate to be credit adjusted.
It also requires entities to recalculate all their provisions based on the current discount rate at each year end should the discount rate change.
The reduction in shareholders funds under US GAAP of 5m 2005 10m represents a reduction of 30m 2005 27m in non-current assets, partly offset by a reduction of 25m 2005 17m in provisions.
The reduction in non-current assets includes an increase of 15m 2005 19m in accumulated depreciation.
Further details on decommissioning are given in note 23, page 105.
IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, requires that where the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision shall be discounted.
Under US GAAP, where future payments are not fixed and determinable, the provision should not be discounted.
This results in a 5m 2005 nil increase in provisions and an additional 5m 2005 nil charge to operating costs.
g Under IFRS, where the Group has contractual rights to liquidated damages to reimburse income lost as a result of delays to commissioning of assets under construction, the liquidated damages are accounted for as income.
Liquidated damages recognised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 have been accounted for under US GAAP as a reduction in the value of the asset constructed.
The cumulative reduction in non-current assets of 19m 2005 22m is stated net of a reduction in accumulated depreciation of 8m 2005 5m.
h FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by FAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, and FAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and clarified by the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF consensus on Issue 02-03, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading or Risk Management Activities, establishes accounting and reporting 122 Notes to the accounts continued 31 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
In general, FAS 133 requires that companies recognise all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
BG Group adopted IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on 1 January 2005, with no retrospective application.
BG Group uses derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies.
The maturity of the instruments is up to 30 years.
Commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives under IAS 39 and FAS 133 are calculated based on forward price curves where available.
The Group calculates the fair value of interest rate and currency exchange rate derivative instruments by using market valuations where available or, where not available, by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Certain derivatives have been designated under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, with gains and losses attributable to these instruments deferred in equity and recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedge transaction occurs.
The Group applies hedge accounting to commodity instruments under FAS 133 when the documentation and effectiveness testing performed under IAS 39 also satisfies the requirements of FAS 133.
When additional documentation or testing is required, the Group does not apply hedge accounting under US GAAP and recognises all movements in the fair value of the respective commodity instruments in the income statement.
Certain long-term gas contracts operating in the UK gas market have terms within the contract that constitute written options and accordingly they fall within the scope of IAS 39.
They are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
These contracts are also considered derivatives under FAS 133, along with certain other contracts that do not qualify for the normal sale exception under US GAAP as their terms were assessed at the date of adoption of FAS 133 rather than the date of inception of the contract.
A reconciliation of the opening and closing differences in respect of the liability for commodity instruments is as follows: 2006 2005 m m As at 1 January 547 547 Impact of adoption of IAS 39 380 Fair value movements in the income statement 594 380 Fair value movements derecognised from equity under US GAAP 89 As at 31 December 42 547 Under IAS 39, BG Group applies hedge accounting for certain currency and interest rate derivatives.
The hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and FAS 133 are not identical.
Certain hedges utilised by the Groups treasury operations would not qualify as effective hedges under FAS 133, without additional designations and documentation.
Accordingly, under US GAAP the Group does not apply hedge accounting for any treasury hedging relationships existing under IAS 39, and all movements in fair value on the associated derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
Basis adjustments to non-current borrowings required by IAS 39 in respect of highly effective fair value adjustments have not been recognised under US GAAP.
In addition, amounts recognised in respect of derivative financial instruments classified within non-current assets of 273m 2005 84m or non-current liabilities of 90m 2005 2m under IFRS would be shown within current assets or current liabilities respectively under US GAAP.
During 2006 and 2005, energy trading activities within the scope of EITF 02-03, comprised forward based physicaland cash-settled commodity contracts consisting of forwards, futures and options.
The activity surrounding certain contracts which are distinct from BG Groups ordinary commercial marketing arrangements involves the frequent buying and selling of commodities with the objective of generating profit on the short-term differences in price.
The fair value, based on external market quotes, of such commodity contracts included within net assets under both IFRS and US GAAP includes an asset of 7m 2005 9m liability relating to energy trading contracts.
Movements in fair value are shown within revenue and other operating income in the income statement.
The table below shows the reconciliation between the opening and closing values of BG Groups energy trading contracts: 2006 2005 m m Value of energy trading contracts as at 1 January 9 1 Realised gains losses 4 1 Unrealised gains losses arising in year 12 9 Value of energy trading contracts as at 31 December 7 9 The 2006 closing balance includes assets of 8m attributable to energy trading contracts maturing in 2007.
Gross transaction volumes of 3 727 mmbtu have been physically settled in the year.
i Under IFRS, as set out in note 6, page 91, BG Group concluded it no longer had control of GASA and therefore MetroGAS on signing of the Master Restructuring Agreement with the other shareholder and creditors of GASA, the parent company of MetroGAS, in December 2005.
In light of the requirements of IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, BG Group has deconsolidated GASA and MetroGAS.
As at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006 these companies are accounted for under the equity method and recognised at nil value in the Financial Statements.
IAS 28, Investments in Associates, sets an explicit requirement that credit balances in an associate are not recognised if the investor has no obligation to make payments on behalf of the associate.
123 31 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued Under US GAAP, an entity should not be consolidated where control does not rest with the majority owners, either because the subsidiary is in legal reorganisation or bankruptcy, or in other circumstances where control does not exist, such as where the rights of minority interest holders effectively allow the minority the ability to participate in significant decisions concerning the entity in the ordinary course of business also referred to as substantive participating rights.
Accordingly, under US GAAP, BG Group considered that having entered into the Master Restructuring Agreement in December 2005, it no longer controlled GASA and MetroGAS.
A reconciling difference exists in respect of the timing of the gain on disposal.
Under IFRS, the gain is recognised on the date that control is lost.
US GAAP requires the entity to be deconsolidated, but also requires a parent to carry a negative net investment as a liability until all precedent conditions to a restructuring plan are resolved.
The Master Restructuring Agreement is subject to regulatory approval.
The gain on disposal 56m was therefore recognised as a difference in net income under US GAAP in 2005, 6m of the gain under IFRS related to transfer of currency translation differences previously recognised in equity and these were transferred back to equity in 2005 under US GAAP.
The remaining 50m was recognised as an additional current liability under US GAAP and constituted the difference in shareholders funds.
Immediately prior to deconsolidation, the Groups balance sheet contained the following balances in respect of GASA and MetroGAS: goodwill 3m: other non-current assets 139m: current assets 127m: current liabilities 373 m: non-current liabilities 1 m: minority interest 55m.
The current liability as at 31 December 2006 was 43m 2005 50m.
The movement in the current liability of 7m relates to foreign exchange movements and has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
j Under IFRS prior to the adoption of IAS 39, certain currency translation adjustments on borrowings were taken to reserves to offset the foreign exchange exposure on foreign investments.
Under US GAAP, the currency translation adjustment on those borrowings would be expensed through the income statement.
In 2006 and 2005 there is no adjustment as the treatment under IAS 39 is similar to that under US GAAP.
k BG Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to restate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
This has resulted in a difference with the amount recognised under US GAAP in respect of a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of the Groups interest in the Panna Mukta and Tapti fields, offshore India, in 2002.
Under US GAAP, there is an increase in non-current assets of 19m 2005 24m, stated net of accumulated depreciation of 8m 2005 7m.
The adjustment is released to the income statement in line with the depreciation of the related assets.
No reconciling difference between IFRS and US GAAP arises in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions which have occurred subsequent to the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2003. l Under IFRS, provision for deferred income tax is required on a full provision basis in accordance with IAS 12, Income Taxes.
Under US GAAP, FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, similarly requires deferred tax to be provided on a full liability basis.
The balance sheet adjustment calculated under FAS 109 and the deferred tax balances carried forward under US GAAP are shown below: as at 31 December 2006 2005 Net Net Deferred Deferred Assets Liabilities Tax Assets Liabilities Tax m m m m m m a Net deferred tax recognised under IFRS restated 74 1 146 1 072 91 733 642 Temporary differences in respect of US GAAP adjustments, b excluding tax 14 62 76 27 256 229 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP in respect of tax c d treatments 23 15 8 10 43 33 Total US GAAP adjustment in respect of tax 9 77 68 37 299 262 Net deferred tax under US GAAP 65 1 069 1 004 54 434 380 a Further details are set out in note 24 on page 106. b Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to adjustments in the reconciliation between shareholders equity under IFRS and shareholders funds under US GAAP.
c IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be provided for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates except where the parent is able to control the timing of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
US GAAP also requires deferred tax to be provided for such taxable temporary differences but makes an exception for temporary differences associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which are essentially permanent in duration.
Accordingly, under US GAAP, no deferred tax has been provided in respect of the Groups investments in foreign corporate joint ventures, resulting in an increase to shareholders funds of 14m 2005 43m.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1 461m 2005 1 193m.
d Deferred tax is recognised under both IFRS and US GAAP in respect of share-based payments.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is recognised in respect of the estimated future tax deduction based on the intrinsic value at the balance sheet date.
To the extent that the estimated future tax deduction exceeds the related compensation cost, the excess deferred tax is recognised in equity.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax is only recognised on compensation cost charged to the income statement.
This has resulted in a reduction to shareholders funds under US GAAP of 22m 2005 10m.
124 Notes to the accounts continued 31 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued The deferred tax asset of 65m 2005 54m is expected to be recovered after more than 12 months.
Details of deductible temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unutilised tax credits which have not been recognised as deferred tax assets under IFRS are set out in note 24, page 106.
Under US GAAP, these would be presented as assets, fully offset by an equivalent valuation allowance.
There were no other valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in 2006 or 2005.
The deferred tax liability of 1 069m 2005 434m is shown after the offset of certain deferred tax assets relating to the same fiscal authority: the liability prior to such offset is 1 428m 2005 1 138m.
The net amount expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 1 063m 2005 445m.
m BG Group adopted IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease on 1 January 2006 which provides guidance for determining whether an arrangement for the right of use of property, plant and equipment contains a lease.
BG Group has concluded that the contract for the provision of capacity at Lake Charles contains a finance lease and comparative information has been amended to reflect this arrangement.
In addition, BG Group identified an operating lease within one of its power purchase agreements, where BG Group is the lessor.
This guidance is similar to the guidance under EITF 01-8 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease but EITF 01-8 was effective for all arrangements from 1 January 2004.
Therefore there is a difference in the treatment of arrangements initiated, modified or acquired in reporting periods beginning before 1 January 2004.
This results in an increase in non-current assets, deferred tax assets, short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings of 257m 2005 263m, 8m 2005 7m, 10m 2005 10m and 270m 2005 273m respectively, compared to the balance sheet under US GAAP.
The increase in non-current assets is net of accumulated depreciation of 52m 2005 43m.
n In accordance with FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, BG Groups listed investments are revalued at each period end, with differences charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income.
Similar treatment is required under IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which BG Group adopted with effect from 1 January 2005.
Prior to the adoption of IAS 39, investments were held at cost less any provision for impairment.
o IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, requires that the results and the profits or losses on disposal of operations which represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, and which meet other specific criteria, be reported as discontinued operations.
Operations not satisfying all these conditions are classified as continuing.
Under US GAAP, FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, requires a different set of conditions to be fulfilled, and classifies as discontinuing smaller components of a group than would constitute a separate major line of business under IFRS.
In 2006, BG Group committed to a plan to dispose of its interests in Mauritania Holdings B. V. an operation classified within the E&P segment and Microgen Energy, a business classified within the Other activities segment.
In 2005, BG Group disposed of its telecoms businesses in Brazil.
In addition, management committed to a plan to dispose of the Groups telecoms businesses in India.
The disposal was completed in 2006.
These businesses were classified within the Other activities segment.
In 2004, BG Group disposed of its interests in the Muturi Production Sharing Contract within the E&P segment and Tangguh LNG project within the LNG segment.
In addition, management committed to a plan to dispose of Premier Transmission Limited, a UK joint venture within the T&D segment.
The disposal was completed in 2005.
These are all classified as discontinued operations under US GAAP and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly: IFRS treats them as continuing operations as they do not represent a major line of business or geographical operation.
Further details on disposals are given in note 6, page 91.
There is no material difference between the total net income analysed as discontinued operations under US GAAP and gains and losses on disposal of the assets listed above.
Aggregate assets and liabilities disposed during the year were as follows: during the year ended 31 December 2006 2005 m m Non-current assets 7 598 Current assets 1 16 Current liabilities 1 59 Non-current liabilities 3 Net assets disposed 7 552 Details of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are set out in note 19, page 99. p A reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share is arrived at by adjusting both the numerator and denominator with the adjustments given in note 10, page 94.
One ADS is equivalent to five ordinary shares.
q On 1 January 2002, BG Group adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, under which goodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed annually for impairment.
Under IFRS, a similar treatment is required.
Prior to the adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2003, BG Group amortised goodwill in line with UK GAAP.
In addition, BG Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 not to restate business combinations which occurred prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
This results in a reconciling difference with US GAAP within shareholders funds in respect of amortisation charged prior to 1 January 2003.
125 31 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued EXPLANATION OF RECONCILING DIFFERENCES NOT QUANTIFIED BETWEEN IFRS AND US GAAP A Under IFRS, the Groups Financial Statements include a consolidated income statement, presented in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.
Under US GAAP, certain items are included in different lines on the income statement than under IFRS.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a consolidated income statement in a US GAAP format, but using IFRS figures: 2006 2005 2004 Restated Restated m m m Total revenue 7 661 5 407 4 063 Operating costs 4 506 3 514 2 748 Loss profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 49 446 87 Operating income 3 106 2 339 1 402 Net interest 40 7 33 Profit before income taxes 3 146 2 346 1 369 Income taxes 1 461 939 583 Share of net income of affiliates 139 158 125 Minority interests in income of consolidated entities 45 40 28 Net income 1 779 1 525 883 The income statement above includes an increase in operating costs and a reduction in interest to reclassify the charge to finance costs on the unwinding of the Groups decommissioning provisions and the charge to finance costs in respect of the Groups pension schemes.
In addition, it reflects a reduction in operating costs and a reduction in revenue to reclassify certain royalty payments.
Under IFRS, BG Group accounts for revenue net of indirect taxes.
As permitted under IFRS, BG Group has presented the balance sheets in ascending order of liquidity, analysed between net assets and equity.
Under US GAAP, assets and liabilities would be presented in descending order of liquidity and the analysis would be between total assets and total liabilities plus shareholders funds.
Certain items that are disclosed in the notes under IFRS would be disclosed on the face of the balance sheet under US GAAP.
B BG Groups Financial Statements include a cash flow statement prepared in accordance with IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements and no separate cash flow statement is prepared under FAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Financing cash flows for interest paid and received under IAS 7 would be classified as operating cash flows under FAS 95.
Operating cash flows from tax benefits on share option exercises under IAS 7 would be classified as financing cash flows under FAS 95.
C FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantees.
FIN 45 also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees.
It requires the guarantor to recognise a liability for the non-contingent component of the guarantee.
This is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur.
The initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception.
The recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payment will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements.
Since 1 January 2003, BG Group has issued or modified guarantees to joint ventures and associates with a maximum exposure as at 31 December 2006 of 431m 2005 428m.
Their fair value as at 31 December 2006 was 2m 2005 2m.
The guarantees relate to the Groups Egyptian LNG facilities and the fair value is recognised within provisions and the carrying value of the investment.
BG Group adopted the IASBs amendments to IAS 39 in respect of financial guarantee contracts and credit insurance on 1 January 2006.
The provisions of the amended standard are similar to those of FIN 45, although full retrospective application is required.
As a result the fair value recognised under IFRS at 31 December 2006 exceeds that under FIN 45 by 2m 2005 3m.
Further disclosures about BG Groups guarantees, commitments and contingencies, including those required under IAS 37 and the Companies Act 1985 in the UK, are given in note 27, page 108.
There is no impact on net income or shareholders funds.
D On 21 June 2005, BG Group acquired the remaining 50% of Brindisi LNG S. p. A that it did not already own for a cash consideration of 11m plus a deferred contingent sum of 18m, subsequently paid in full in 2006.
IFRS 3 requires that, when a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent on future events, the acquirer shall include the amount of the adjustment in the cost of the combination at the acquisition date if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably.
Under US GAAP, contingent consideration may not be recorded as a liability unless the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond reasonable doubt.
The difference in 2005 resulted in a lower balance on intangible assets, offset by lower provisions under US GAAP.
The GAAP difference was removed in 2006 on payment of the contingent consideration.
It did not impact net income or shareholders funds as the assets were still under construction and not subject to amortisation.
126 Notes to the accounts continued 31 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued NEW US GAAP ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2006, the FASB issued FAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, which provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with FAS 133.
It is effective for fiscal periods beginning after 15 September 2006 and was adopted by BG Group on 1 January 2007.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2006, the FASB issued FAS 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets.
This Statement amends FAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, with respect to the accounting for separately recognised servicing assets and servicing liabilities.
FAS 156 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after 15 September 2006 and was adopted by BG Group on 1 January 2007.
In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements which provides guidance on the methodology to be followed when calculating fair values as required by other standards.
It is effective for fiscal periods beginning after 15 November 2007.
BG Group is currently assessing the impact on the Groups consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.
The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition.
It is effective for fiscal periods beginning after 15 December 2006.
In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which provides the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
