Petroleum general and administrative costs relating to oil and gas activities are included.
Income taxes were determined by applying the applicable statutory rates to pre-tax income with adjustments for permanent differences and tax credits.
Certain allocations of tax provisions among geographic areas were necessary and are based on managements assessment of the principal factors giving rise to the tax obligation.

Included in capitalised exploratory well costs at 30 June 2006 was US$3.5 million related to exploratory wells that were associated with areas not requiring major capital expenditure before production could begin, where more than one year has elapsed since the completion of drilling.
These wells form part of the North West Shelf joint ventures long term development plans and will be developed when reserves are required.
