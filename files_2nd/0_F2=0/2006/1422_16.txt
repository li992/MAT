They are prepared under the historical cost convention, except that derivative financial instruments and current investments are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards UK GAAP and the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been included in these financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 1 no cash flow statement for the Company has been included on the grounds that the group includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 8 no related party disclosures for the Company have been included.
In these financial statements, the following new standards have been adopted for the first time: FRS 20, Share-based payments, requires that an expense for share options granted be recognised in the financial statements based on their fair value at the date of the grant.
This expense is recognised over the vesting period of the options.
Adopting FRS 20 has resulted in a share-based payment charge of 1m to the 2005 opening balance sheet.
FRS 21, Events after the balance sheet date, requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation.
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 21 retrospectively, and the 2005 final dividend of 95m previously recognised has been reversed as it was not approved by the shareholders until after the balance sheet date.
This has increased net assets as at 17 September 2005.
The corresponding increase in net assets as at 18 September 2004 was 88m.
FRS 23, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, sets out additional guidance on the translation method for transactions in foreign currencies and on determining the functional and presentation currencies.
FRS 23 also requires goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any related fair value adjustments to be treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation, thus expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
In accordance with FRS 23, the Company has applied the requirement to express goodwill and fair value adjustments in the functional currency of foreign operations prospectively to all acquisitions occurring after 18 September 2004.
The adoption of FRS 23 has had no effect on the Companys profit or net assets.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, not to prepare a financial statements note relating to financial instruments as the information is available in the published financial statements of the group.
Also, in accordance with FRS 25, the Company is not required to restate comparative information.
FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Measurement, sets out the requirements for measurement, recognition and derecognition for financial instruments.
The adoption of FRS 26 has had no effect on the Companys profit or net assets.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Intangible assets goodwill Intangible assets consist of goodwill arising on acquisitions since 17 September 1998, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration of new subsidiary undertakings over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised in accordance with FRS 10 and amortised over its useful life, not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill previously written off against reserves has not been reinstated.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of foreign operations and related fair value adjustments occurring after 18 September 2004 are to be treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation, thus expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are reported at cost less any provision for impairment.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs, and thereafter at amortised cost, except for current asset investments.
The group has designated current asset investments as at fair value through the profit and loss as doing so results in more relevant information.
These instruments are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the groups risk management and investment strategy.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the contractual rights to receive the cash flows are transferred.
The contractual rights to receive cash flows are transferred when substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
113 Financial statements Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Accounting policies continued for the year ended 16 September 2006 Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Company operates both a defined contribution and defined benefits scheme.
Contributions for the defined contribution scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
The defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer scheme and the Company is unable to identify its share of underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Hence, contributions to the defined benefit scheme are accounted for as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme.

Contingent liabilities The Company has not adopted the amendments to FRS 26 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a further payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 17 September 2006.
The Company has no outstanding guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business as at 16 September 2006 2005 49m.
Other information Emoluments of directors The remuneration of the directors of the Company is shown in the directors remuneration report for the group on pages 40 to 45.
Employees The Company has 102 employees in 2006 2005 94.

Prior to 6 April 2006 some of the employees of the Company were members of the British Sugar Pension Scheme.
On 6 April 2006, the British Sugar Pension Scheme was merged with the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme.
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the schemes assets and liabilities on a consistent basis, as permitted by FRS 17, the scheme will be accounted for by the Company as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
On 30 September 2002 the Scheme was closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements introduced for these members.
For the defined contribution scheme, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
The last actuarial valuations of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme and the British Sugar Pension Scheme were carried out as at 5 April 2005 and 1 October 2004 respectively.
At the valuation dates the total market value of the assets of the Schemes was 1,869m and represented 97% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The particulars of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme are contained in note 13 in the consolidated financial statements.
There is no material difference in the valuation methodologies under IAS 19 and FRS 17.
Auditors fees Fees paid to the group auditors in respect of audit services provided to the Company amounted to 0.5m 2005 0.4m.
