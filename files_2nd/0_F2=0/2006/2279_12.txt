The recoverable amounts of the Business Units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the Business Units.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows from all Business Units is 8.7%.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash ows thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 3.3% being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Goodwill written off in the year includes to the impairment of two North American heat treatment plants 2.0m, the impairment of one North American testing facility 3.8m and the disposal of a Swedish testing facility 0.2m.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of 6.9m 2005: 6.3m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group had no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Bank and cash balances Bank and cash balances comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into foreign currency denominated cross currency swaps that were designated as a hedging instrument for the purposes of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 15.4m 2005: 37.5m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 1.8m 2005: 5.3m of such losses.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 348.0m 2005: 290.7m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignicant.

The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualied independent actuary as at 6 April 2005 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2006.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 1.1m, equivalent to approximately 14% of pensionable pay plus a special contribution of 2.2m.
This level of contribution has been reviewed following the triennial valuation of the scheme completed as at 6 April 2005 and it is expected that the deficit will be extinguished in no more than ten years.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside the profit and loss account and in the statement of recognised income and expense.
