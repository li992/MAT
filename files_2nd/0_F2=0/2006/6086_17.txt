Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information FKI plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds except where otherwise indicated.
2 Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, for the first time and the comparatives have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP to comply with IFRS.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position and financial performance of the Group is provided in note 44.
No material adjustments other than changes in presentation have been made to the consolidated cash flow statement.
On 18 October 2005 the Group published detailed income statement, balance sheet and equity reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS.
The information contained in note 44 is an abridged extract of this published document.
The published document is posted on the FKI plc website www.
A copy of the document may also be obtained from the Company Secretary of FKI plc at the registered office.
The disclosures of continuing operations and discontinued operations for the comparative period have been restated in these financial statements to reflect all operations that have been discontinued at 31 March 2006.
This is in accordance with IFRS 5.
Therefore, the comparative information disclosed in these financial statements does not agree to those figures issued on 18 October 2005 or to the restatement information in note 44 to the accounts.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and these are presented in a separate section of this report on pages 123 to 137.
3 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The policies set out below have been consistently applied except for those relating to classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The Group has made use of the exemption under IFRS 1 to only apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 April 2005.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been prepared on the historic cost basis except for non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale which are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less estimated costs to sell.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 have been prepared on the historic cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and available for sale financial assets which have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less estimated costs to sell.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of FKI plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year, together with the Groups share of the results of associates using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included from or up to the date on which control is transferred to or out of the Group respectively.
60 FKI plc 3 Significant accounting policies continued c Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
d Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
Exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity are taken directly to reserves to the extent that they can be offset against the exchange differences arising on the equity investments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income and cash flows of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, with the year end adjustment to closing rates being taken to reserves.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation at year end rates of the net investment in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings at the beginning of the year are taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the determination of profit for the financial year.
Exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are taken to translation reserves in equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in reserves relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be reset to zero at the transition date 1 April 2004 to IFRS.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on all assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Short leasehold property over the lease term Plant and machinery heavy production 15 years other 10 years Office equipment 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, less costs of disposal, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
61 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued f Goodwill Goodwill on business acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill on acquisitions after 31 March 2004 is not amortised and goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS which is 1 April 2004, is not amortised after that date.
Goodwill existing at the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts as the Group has elected not to restate business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Negative goodwill arising on any acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
g Intangible assets i Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is capitalised when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Any expenditure capitalised is amortised over the lesser of the useful life of the project or three years.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets including those arising from a business combination are amortised over their remaining useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, unless such lives are indefinite.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer software 3 years h Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
i Leases Assets obtained under leases and hire purchase contracts which result in the transfer to the Group of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of underlying lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the income statement over the period of the lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in each period.
Rentals paid under other leases operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
62 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued j Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money, and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
k Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in first-out basis, and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving inventory.
Cost comprises direct materials and labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads, based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
l Construction contracts Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
Stage of completion is determined by the costs incurred to date to the extent that such costs represent progress made on the project.
Cost comprises direct materials and labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from construction contract customers, for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less provisions for foreseeable losses exceeds progress billings.
Progress billings not yet paid by customers and retentions are included within trade and other receivables.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to construction contract customers for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits, less recognised foreseeable losses.
m Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
63 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued n Pensions and other post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution pension schemes Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are recognised within operating profit at an amount equal to the contributions payable to the scheme for the period.
Any prepaid or outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date are recognised respectively as assets or liabilities within prepayments or accruals.
ii Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits Pension liabilities are measured at their present value in accordance with actuarial assumptions that are updated at each balance sheet date.
Pension assets are measured at fair value.
The pension liability or asset is recognised in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are recognised as follows: a Within operating profit The current service cost arising from employee service in the current period: The prior service cost related to employee service in prior periods arising in the current period as a result of improvements to benefits: Gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised within operating profit.
b Within other finance cost or income The interest cost on the liabilities, calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of the period.
The expected return on assets, calculated by reference to the assets and their long-term expected rate of return at the beginning of the period.
c Within the statement of recognised income and expense On the scheme assets the difference between the expected and actual return on assets: On the scheme liabilities a the differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and b the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
o Share-based payment transactions Certain employees including directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuation.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of FKI plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards at that date based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
64 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued o Share-based payment transactions continued The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004. p Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer.
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on construction contracts.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term basis is recognised when the service is complete.
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
q Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting i Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2005 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement have been applied for the first time in the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2006.
Therefore, the comparative information prepared under IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2005 applies UK GAAP to the treatment of derivative instruments.
Set out below is the UK GAAP accounting policy: Derivatives for hedging purposes are held off balance sheet with the exception of cross currency swaps, where the net exchange gain loss as a result of exchange rate movements is recorded on the balance sheet to reflect the substance of the transaction.
The movements in the balance sheet value are recorded in reserves since the borrowing is a hedge of the associated currency net assets.
The net interest cost income arising on interest rate swaps is charged credited to the interest line in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Monetary discounts or premiums arising on the disposal or other early termination of interest rate swaps are amortised on a straight line basis over the original unexpired life of the swap against interest charges in the profit and loss account.
Finance costs are recognised in the income statement over the term of the instruments to which they relate at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by the payments made in the period.
ii Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006 The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financial and investment activities.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
65 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued q Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued ii Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006 continued For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges where they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges eg: interest rate swaps which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
In relation to cash flow hedges eg: forward foreign currency contracts including cross currency swap contracts to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For cash flow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
r Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax in respect of taxable or deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or in the case of assets, taxable profit will be unavailable against which the temporary differences, can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which it is anticipated that the asset will be realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
66 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued s Investments i Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2005 Investments are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment in value.
ii Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006 All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and the costs of acquisition.
After initial recognition, investments which are classified as held for trading or available for sale, are measured at fair value.
Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in income.
Gains or losses on available for sale investments are recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement.
Investments classified as held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity.
For investments carried at amortised cost, gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired.
The fair values of quoted investments are determined by reference to current bid prices.
For investments for which there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by reference either to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash flows of the underlying net asset base of the investment.
t Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Where, prior to the Groups adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005, an effective fair value hedging relationship existed between a cross currency swap contract and a qualifying loan borrowing, the carrying value of the loan borrowing is adjusted by an amount to offset the value of the related fair value hedge to the extent that such value has not been recognised through the income statement.
Gains and losses are recognised in net profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
u Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a major qualifying asset, are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset if the costs are significant and a significant period of time is required to complete the asset.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
67 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued v Adopted standards and interpretations not yet applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The effective date quoted below relates to the annual period beginning on or after: International Accounting Standards Board IAS IFRSs Effective date Amendment to IAS 39: Financial Instruments The fair value option 1 January 2006 Amendment to IAS 39: Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions 1 January 2006 Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts : Financial Instruments: Financial guarantee contracts 1 January 2006 Amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of financial statements capital disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 6: Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources 1 January 2006 IFRS 7: Financial Instruments disclosures 1 January 2007 Amendment to IAS 21: Net investment in a foreign operation 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 4: Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2006 IFRIC 5: Rights to interests arising from fide-commissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds 1 January 2006 IFRIC 6: Liabilities arising from participation in a specific market waste, electrical and electronic equipment 1 December 2005 The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the periods of initial application commencing on or after 1 April 2006.
With respect to the financial guarantee contracts, where the Group enters into such contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements and as such in this respect the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
w Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates and judgements in a number of areas.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post-retirement benefits The determination of the pension and other post retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Deferred income tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised.
In particular, significant judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realised.

The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
The discount rate applied was 9.2%.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market and inflation.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows thereafter using a growth rate applicable to the relevant market.
This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.

As is more fully explained in accounting policy notes 3 q and 3 t, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 to only apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 April 2005.
Accordingly, the comparative figures for 2005 are the equivalent UK GAAP figures.
To comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39, the comparative information below would present 54.5 million of cross-currency swap assets as derivative financial instruments within derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities, as appropriate, and increase the book value of the Euro 600 million guaranteed Eurobond by 35.7 million in respect of deferred income arising on interest rate swaps closed out in September 2003.

87 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 27 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued The Euro 600 million guaranteed Eurobond matures on 22 February 2010 and bears interest at 6.625%.
Costs incurred in issuing these bonds are amortised over the ten year life of the bond.
The remaining unamortised issue costs at 31 March 2006 are 2.2 million 2005: 2.3 million.
The Company has transacted a number of cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps to synthetically alter the currency and interest rate obligations of Euro 576 million out of the Euro 600 million obligation.
These cross-currency and interest rate swaps are reported as derivative financial instruments.
The guaranteed bank borrowings are drawn under the Companys syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility.
Drawdowns under this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging between 0.5% and 0.7% depending upon the level of the Companys debt.
This facility matures on 26 July 2007 and is guaranteed by the Companys subsidiaries FKI Engineering Limited and FKI Industries Inc.
The US Dollar 173.5 million 2005: US Dollar 183.5 million guaranteed US private placement loan notes are issued by the Companys subsidiary FKI Industries Inc. and guaranteed by the Company.

On this date a number of derivative financial instruments held by the Group qualified as effective cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges.
For comparative purposes, the above table shows the 31 March 2005 derivative financial instruments on the basis that the 1 April 2005 hedge designation had been made one day earlier.
Cash flow hedges At 31 March 2006 the Company held two cross-currency swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges.
These swaps hedge the cash flow variability arising on movements in the Euro : Sterling exchange rate and protect Euro 30 million of the Euro 600 million Eurobond.
The terms of the contracts are: Currency Principal Maturity Interest rate Cross-currency swaps FKI pays Sterling 20.7 million 22 February 2010 8% fixed, payable semi-annually FKI receives Euro 30.0 million 22 February 2010 6.625% fixed, receivable annually There have been no changes in the above swaps during the course of the year.
89 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Derivative financial instruments continued Fair value hedges At 31 March 2006 the Company held eight cross-currency swaps and two interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges.
These swaps hedge against changes in interest rates affecting the fair value of Euro 544 million of the Euro 600 million fixed rate Eurobond.
The terms of the contract are: Currency Principal Maturity Interest rate Cross-currency swaps FKI pays Sterling 41.4 million 22 Feb 2010 3 month LIBOR plus 3%, payable quarterly FKI receives Euro 60.0 million 22 Feb 2010 6.625% fixed, receivable annually FKI pays Sterling 293.9 million 22 Feb 2010 6 month LIBOR plus 3%, payable semi-annually FKI receives Euro 426.0 million 22 Feb 2010 6.625% fixed, receivable annually Interest rate swaps FKI pays Euro 58.0 million 22 Feb 2010 3 month EURIBOR plus 3.46%, payable quarterly FKI receives Euro 58.0 million 22 Feb 2010 6.625% fixed, receivable annually The above interest rate swaps leaves a residual Euro 58 million exposure which the Company has designated as an effective net investment hedge of its investments in the Eurozone.
There have been no changes in the above swaps during the course of the year.
Net investment hedges At 31 March 2006 the Company held 11 cross-currency swaps that were designated as net investment hedges of investments in non sterling subsidiary companies.
These swaps protect against changes in exchange rates afffecting the sterling value of subsidiaries that are located in the United States, Canada, Denmark and the Eurozone.
The terms of the contracts are: Currency Principal Maturity Interest rate basis Cross-currency swaps US Dollars FKI pays US Dollar 41.8 million 22 February 2010 3 month LIBOR plus 3.65%, payable quarterly FKI receives Sterling 22.1 million 22 February 2010 3 month LIBOR plus 3%, receivable semi-annually FKI pays US Dollar 321.8 million 22 February 2010 6 month LIBOR plus 4.23%, payable semi-annually FKI receives Sterling 202.8 million 22 February 2010 6 month LIBOR plus 3%, receivable quarterly FKI pays US Dollar 29.42 million 22 February 2010 8.51% fixed, payable semi-annually FKI receives Sterling 20.7 million 22 February 2010 8% fixed, receivable semi-annually Cross-currency swaps Canadian Dollars FKI pays Canadian Dollar 45.1 million 22 February 2010 3 month Interbank rate plus 3.65%, payable quarterly FKI receives Sterling 19.3 million 22 February 2010 3 month LIBOR plus 3%, receivable quarterly 90 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Derivative financial instruments continued Currency Principal Maturity Interest rate basis Cross-currency swaps Danish Krone FKI pays Danish Krone 981.4 million 22 February 2010 6 month CIBOR plus 3.54%, payable quarterly FKI receives Sterling 91.1 million 22 February 2010 6 month LIBOR plus 3%, receivable quarterly Cross-currency swaps Euro FKI pays Euro 15.0 million 10 October 2007 7.21% fixed, payable semi-annually FKI receives Sterling 10.4 million 10 October 2007 8% fixed, receivable semi-annually On 13 June 2006 the Company increased its liability under one of the US Dollar swaps semi-annual by US Dollar 35.6 million.
This swap, which was originally transacted at a US Dollar : Sterling exchange rate of US Dollar 1.3768, was reset to the prevailing market exchange rate of 1.7464.
This transaction was undertaken to reduce the Companys credit exposure to the swap counterparty.
The resulting 23.6 million net cash settlement in favour of the Company has no impact on the Groups reported overall net debt.
There have been no further changes in the above swaps during the course of the year.
Financial risk management a Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market prices discounted to current value.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing rates translated at year end exchange rates.

b Foreign currency risk The Group operates globally with the majority of its profits earned outside the UK.
It has significant investments outside the UK with the largest investments being in North America followed by Europe.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the Group has financed most of its investments in the USA, Canada and Europe by borrowing in US dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and Danish krone.
Some of this funding is achieved by directly borrowing the relevant currency whilst some is achieved through cross-currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
The main currencies of net debt, after taking into account the effects of cross-currency swaps, are set out below.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures on committed, and occasionally forecast, receipts and payments in foreign currencies.

The Groups borrowings exhibit some seasonal variations during the year and for that reason the board requires long-term funding and committed borrowing facilities to always exceed actual and projected debt figures by at least 10%.
At the year end 78% 2005: 84% of the Groups committed facilities were drawn.
Of the 692 million 2005: 651 million committed borrowing facilities available to the Group, the undrawn committed facilities were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Expiring in more than one year but no more than two years 150.0 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three years 102.3 As at 31 March 150.0 102.3 The Group also has a number of uncommitted loan and overdraft facilities at is disposal.
These facilities are lightly used.

With the exception of amounts related to vacant leasehold properties the provisions are generally incurred within one to two years.
The vacant leasehold property provisions will be utilised in between one and seven years.
The insurance and litigation provisions represents managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of the nature of such liabilities it is difficult to give an indication of the timing of their settlement but generally this would be between one and ten years.

The unrecognised deferred tax asset is 47.7 million 2005: 40.6 million.
Deferred taxation is not provided in respect of liabilities that might arise on the distribution of available overseas reserves of subsidiary undertakings, except to the extent that the decision to remit such profits has been taken.
Where a liability has not been recognised, it is because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date the aggregate amount of such temporary differences for which deferred tax has not been recognised was 18.3 million 2005: 18.1 million.
32 Finance and operating leases Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts The Group leases certain of its property, plant and equipment under finance leases.
These leases have an average duration of between three and ten years.
The majority of the leases are on a fixed repayment basis and where escalation clauses exist they are linked to LIBOR.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Not later than one year 0.9 1.1 After one year but not more than five years 4.2 3.8 5.1 4.9 Less finance charges allocated to future periods 0.2 0.1 Present value of minimum lease payments 4.9 4.8 The present value of minimum lease payments is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Not later than one year 0.9 1.1 After one year but not more than five years 4.0 3.7 4.9 4.8 95 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Finance and operating leases continued Annual commitments under operating leases The total future minimum rental payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Not later than one year 9.6 11.0 After one year but not more than five years 26.7 20.9 After five years 17.5 20.5 53.8 52.4 33 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits a Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to these defined contribution pension schemes in the year, which were the same as the amount charged to the profit and loss account, amounted to 7.8 million 2005: 7.4 million.
b Defined benefit and other post-retirement benefits The main pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and North America and are defined benefit in type.
These are funded schemes, where the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit method.
In line with normal business practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the United Kingdom and annually in the United States.
These valuations are based on the full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2002, updated at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries, and are consistent with preliminary valuation results of the full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2005.
The dates of the most recent full actuarial valuations, on which the amounts in the financial statements are based, were as follows: Name of the Scheme Location Date of valuation FKI Group Pension Scheme UK 31 December 2002 FKI Industries Inc. Group Pension Plan US 31 December 2004 The Group also operates a number of unfunded post-retirement medical and welfare benefit schemes, principally in the United States.

Both the FKI Group Pension Scheme and the main FKI Industries Inc. Group Pension Plan are now closed to new members and therefore under the projected unit method the current service costs would be expected to increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of scheme.

Own shares Own shares relate to shares of the Company held by the FKI plc Employee Benefit Trust which are transferred to employee option scheme holders on exercise of their options.
The costs of funding and administering the scheme are charged to the income statement of the Company.
Exchange reserve The exchange reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations.
It also includes the effect of translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
104 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 36 Reconciliation of movement in equity continued Share-based payments accrual IFRS 2 requires that an expense for share-based payments be recognised in the income statement based on the fair value at the date of grant.
This expense is recognised over the vesting period of the options.
A share-based payment accrual is recognised as part of equity.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge.
37 Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 As noted in the basis of preparation on page 60 the Group adopted IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: presentation and disclosure from 1 April 2005 and the Group took the exemption not to restate comparatives.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financial and investment activities.
Under IAS 39 financial instruments are recognised initially at cost and subsequent to initial recognition are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Further details of the accounting treatment adopted under IFRS and under UK GAAP are included within the Group accounting policies.
The impact on the balance sheet at 1 April 2005 of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 was as follows: m m Increase in derivative financial assets 64.5 Increase in derivative financial liabilities 6.6 Increase in loans and borrowings 98.2 40.3 Decrease in creditors 35.3 Equity movements: Retained earnings 5.5 Hedging reserve 0.5 5.0 105 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 38 Share-based payments Disclosures of the share-based payments offered to employees are set out below.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all equity settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004.
The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments for the year ended 31 March 2006 was 1.4 million 2005: 1.1 million.
a Share option scheme The Group operates an executive share option scheme.
All executive options granted up to and including 31 March 2006 may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the Groups growth in earnings per share must exceed the UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year period, subject to re-testing in subsequent years from a rolling base.
The re-testing condition was removed for options granted after April 2004.
The contractual lifetime of the options is ten years.
For options granted from 1 April 2006 none will vest for an earnings per share less than the retail price index plus 12% over the three years movement period.
For earnings per share at or greater than retail price index plus 12%, awards will vest on a straight line basis.
Details of the vesting levels are included in the remuneration report.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at 31 March 2006 is 87p to 116.5p 2005: 87p to 116.5p.
The options exercised during the year relate to options exercised by employees of disposed of companies and employees made redundant.
The fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period and is estimated on the date of the grant by Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow Limited using the binomial pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions.

In addition, there are contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business in connection with the completion of contracts within specification, including responsibilities for maintenance.
The Group is also the subject of various pending legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business, including claims on contracts, product liability, environmental claims and others.
The claims giving rise to such proceedings are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance and third party indemnities.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not believe that these claims, after allowing for provisions already made, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial results.
43 Related party transactions Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
The Groups associate is Mediterranean Power Electric Company Limited and no transactions were made between the Group and its associate during the years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005.
The remuneration of the directors, who are considered to be the key management personnel, is provided in the Remuneration report on pages 43 to 53.
44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS i Introduction As stated in note 2, these are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The comparatives have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices GAAP.
On 18 October 2005 the Group published detailed income statement and balance sheet reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS.
The following is an abridged extract of the published document.
ii Transitional arrangements IFRS 1 permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
FKI plc has elected to apply the following key exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS: a Business combinations The Group has applied the exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations prior to the transition date 1 April 2004.
As a result, in the opening balance sheet goodwill arising from past business combinations remains as stated under UK GAAP at 31 March 2004.
110 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued ii Transitional arrangements continued b Financial instruments The Group has taken the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
The Group is applying these standards from 1 April 2005. c Pensions and other employee benefits The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at the date of transition.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 issued in December 2004. d Share-based payments The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 from 1 April 2004 to those share-based payment transactions that were issued after 7 November 2002 that have not fully vested by 1 April 2004. e Cumulative translation differences A requirement of IAS 21 is that on disposal of an operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised directly to equity for that foreign operation is to be transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be reset to zero at the transition date of 1 April 2004.
FKI plc has elected not to adopt the following exemptions: a Property, plant and equipment The Group has not adopted the exemption to restate items of property, plant and equipment to fair value at the transition date 1 April 2004.
Such items have been maintained at the depreciated historical cost under UK GAAP.
b Assets held for sale and discontinued operations The Group has not adopted the exemption of applying IFRS 5 prospectively from 1 April 2005.
IFRS 5 has been applied from the date of transition 1 April 2004. iii Notes and explanation of IFRS adjustments to the income statements and balance sheets A summary of the principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS as they apply to FKI plc are set out below.
The reconciling items set out in the UK GAAP IFRS reconciliations are cross-referenced to the relevant explanation in this section.
The reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS include a starting point of UK GAAP in IFRS format.
This discloses certain items on the face of the balance sheet such as taxation and deferred taxation which under UK GAAP were included in debtors or creditors and reclassifies pension assets liabilities and provisions into the appropriate category.
In the income statement the UK GAAP non-operating loss on sale and closure of businesses has been included as a starting point under IFRS as the line item loss for the year from discontinued operations.
The disclosures of continuing operations and discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been restated in the financial statements to reflect all operations that have been discontinued at 31 March 2006 in accordance with IFRS 5.
The restatement included within the restatement document issued on 18 October 2005 and included within this note does not therefore agree with the comparative figures included in the financial statements.
111 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued A. Share-based payments Principal difference The Group operates a range of share-based incentive schemes including share options, SAYE schemes and long-term incentive plans LTIP.
Under UK GAAP an expense was recognised for all LTIP schemes in accordance with UITF 17 with a corresponding credit to equity.
IFRS 2: Share-based payments requires that an expense be recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments both awards of options and awards of shares.
This expense has been calculated based on the fair value at the date of the award.
The balance sheet entry is either a credit to liabilities, for cash settled awards, or a credit to equity for equity settled awards.
All existing FKI plc schemes are currently equity settled.
Impact on income statement This has resulted in a net increase to the cost of sales and net operating costs of 1.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
The related tax credit is 0.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet The opening UK GAAP accrual included within the profit and loss account within equity has been reclassified to the share-based payment accrual reserve and the increase in the accrual for each period has been recorded in the share-based payment accrual reserve.
The related deferred tax credit has been adjusted against the deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability as appropriate.
Goodwill Principal difference UK GAAP requires goodwill to be amortised over its expected useful economic life.
Under IFRS goodwill is no longer amortised but held at amortised value at the transition date on the balance sheet and tested for impairment at the date of transition to IFRS and annually thereafter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
No additional impairments were necessary as at the transition date or at 31 March 2005.
The goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP of 26.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been reversed.
The profit loss on sale of businesses disclosed as discontinued under IFRS also changes as the value of the goodwill asset included in the calculation of loss on disposal is higher under IFRS due to no goodwill amortisation.
This resulted in an increase in the loss on discontinued operations of 1.3 million in the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet At the date of transition the UK GAAP carrying value of goodwill was included for IFRS.
The UK GAAP amortisation charge and the discontinued operations element has been reversed resulting in a corresponding increase in the value of goodwill of 25.4 million at 31 March 2005.
112 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued C. Foreign exchange Principal difference Under UK GAAP a foreign currency transaction recorded in the balance sheet can be translated at the contracted rate or forward rate of a related or matching forward contract.
Under IFRS IAS 21, only the spot exchange rate can be used and IAS 21 does not permit the use of a contracted rate.
Impact on income statement This has resulted in a net increase to the operating costs of 0.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
There was no tax impact related to this adjustment primarily due to tax losses brought forward in the relevant businesses.
Impact on balance sheet The carrying value of trade receivables and trade payables changed as a result of adopting IAS 21 as disclosed by the adjustments recorded on the analysis of IFRS adjustments.
D. Dividends Principal difference Under UK GAAP the practice is to recognise dividends in the period to which they relate.
Under IFRS IAS 10:Events after the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends authorised declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37:Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Therefore, the dividend liability needs to be adjusted where appropriate.
Under UK GAAP the dividend charge is recognised in the income statement whereas under IFRS the dividend charge is recognised directly in reserves and not in the income statement.
Impact on the income statement Dividends totalling 26.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been reversed from the income statement.
Impact on balance sheet The final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004 of 17.4 million has been removed from liabilities in the opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2004.
This will be an adjustment through equity in the year ended 31 March 2005.
At 31 March 2005 the 2004 05 final dividends of 17.5 million included as a liability under UK GAAP is reversed and this will be recognised directly in equity in the financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2005.
The total dividend charged directly to reserves for the year ended 31 March 2005 is 26.1 million representing the final 2003 04 dividends of 17.4 million and the interim 2004 05 dividends of 8.7 million.
113 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued E. Valuation of pension fund assets Principal difference Under UK GAAP quoted securities are valued at mid market value in obtaining fair values whereas under IFRS the current bid price should be used.
Impact At the date of transition the value of the scheme pension assets reduces by 0.8 million and this is recorded as an increase in the pension obligations liability.
A deferred tax asset of 0.2 million has also been recognised on transition.
The net impact on reserves is 0.6 million and this adjustment to the actuarial gain loss net of deferred tax is disclosed separately as a reserve movement and will be included in the statement of recognised income and expense.
At 31 March 2005 the value of pension assets reduces by 0.9 million and an increase in the deferred tax asset of 0.3 million is also recognised.
F. Provisions Principal difference Under IFRS, provisions for future trading losses are not allowed as part of a reorganisation closure costs provision unless they relate to onerous contracts.
Impact on income statement There was no impact for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet This resulted in a reduction, net of taxation, in liabilities of 0.1 million at the date of transition, and nil at 31 March 2005.
G. Recycled goodwill and exchange differences Principal difference In calculating the profit loss on disposal of businesses under UK GAAP, goodwill that was previously held in reserves is recycled and included within the profit loss on disposal calculation.
Under IFRS any goodwill held in reserves is not recycled on disposal of a business.
On disposal of a business, under IFRS the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised in equity is taken to the income statement as part of the calculation of profit loss on disposal.
Under UK GAAP cumulative exchange differences remained in reserves.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing the cumulative exchange differences to be reset to zero at the transition date of 1 April 2004.
114 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued G. Recycled goodwill and exchange differences continued Impact on income statement The loss on disposal of businesses loss for the year on discontinued operations decreased by 14.6 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
The exclusion of goodwill held in reserves as part of the calculation reduced the loss on disposal by 13.6 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the inclusion of the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised in reserves reduced the loss on disposal by 1.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet There is no change to the balance sheet other than a reclassification within equity.
H. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations Principal differences There are two principal differences: Firstly, under IFRS 5 a single amount should be included on the face of the income statement relating to discontinued operations.
This shall comprise the total of: the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations: the post-tax loss or gain on the disposal of the discontinued operations.
Therefore, adjustments are required, where appropriate, to each line item in the income statement including revenue, finance costs and taxation.
Under UK GAAP separate disclosure as one line in the income statement of post-tax profit or loss is not required.
Secondly, under IFRS 5 a non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction.
For this to be the case the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable.
The non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are under IFRS presented separately on the balance sheet.
Assets and liabilities should be disclosed separately.
Under UK GAAP separate disclosure in the balance sheet of non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups is not required.
Impact on income statement In the year ended 31 March 2005 91.8 million of sales and a net profit after taxation of 3.5 million was transferred to the line item discontinued operations.
Impact on balance sheet At the transition date of 1 April 2004 there were no non-current assets or disposal groups which met the classification definition of held for sale.
At 31 March 2005 0.5 million was transferred from property plant and equipment to assets held for sale relating to certain properties.
Also, total assets of 38.7 million and total liabilities of 13.3 million were transferred from various balance sheet classifications and disclosed separately as assets held for sale or liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale.
115 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued I. Reclassifications Impact on income statement Under UK GAAP the tax impact of exceptional items, including profit loss on disposal of operations is included within the tax charge.
Under IFRS the tax impact on the profit loss on sale of businesses which meet the definition of discontinued operations is included within the line item profit loss on discontinued operations.
The impact of this adjustment was 0.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, under UK GAAP the non-operating loss on sale and closure of businesses included a 90.0 million charge relating to DeWind following the announcement of the closure of this operation on 8 November 2004.
Also, under UK GAAP the turnover and operating profit were disclosed as discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Under IFRS 5, DeWind is treated as a continuing operation because the assets continue to be used at 31 March 2005.
Impact on balance sheet a IFRS requires computer software that is not an integral part of the hardware to be treated as an intangible asset.
Under UK GAAP all capitalised software was included as property, plant and equipment.
This has resulted in a reclassification from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets of the following values: 3.8 million at date of transition: 3.1 million at 31 March 2005. b IFRS requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be disclosed separately.
Under UK GAAP the deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to pension and other post retirement benefit assets and liabilities were netted off those pension balances.
This has resulted in the following reclassifications: 1 April 31 March 2004 2005 m m Non-current assets: Deferred tax asset 62.6 57.1 Pension and other post-retirement benefit assets 4.5 2.6 Non-current liabilities: Deferred tax liabilities 4.5 2.6 Pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations 62.6 57.1 c IFRS also requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed as non-current assets and liabilities and there are differences under IFRS relating to the netting off of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
This has resulted in a number of reclassifications affecting the deferred tax and corporation tax and overseas tax balances in each of the balance sheets.
116 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 44 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Impact on balance sheet continued d IFRS states that provisions expected to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date should be classified as current liabilities.
This has resulted in the reclassification from non-current liability provisions to current liability provisions of the following values: 17.3 million at date of transition 1 April 2004 : 22.0 million at 31 March 2005. e Other minor balance sheet reclassifications are: i reclassification of trade debtors and trade creditors classified under UK GAAP as over one year old to current assets liabilities as IFRS states all trade debtors should be classified as current.
ii reclassification of balance sheet values relating to IAS 11: Construction Contracts.
This has resulted in reclassifications between inventory and trade and other receivables.
In addition the classification of the trade and other receivables note to the accounts will change.
iii reclassification of certain spare parts from inventory to property, plant and equipment in accordance with IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.
This adjustment was only required in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2005 and the value was 0.3 million.
f The following reclassifications of the components of equity have been made: 1 April 31 March 2004 2005 m m Retained earnings 1.4 0.2 Exchange reserve 1.6 Share-based payment accrual 1.4 1.4 The adjustments relate to the following: reclassification of cumulative exchange differences from retained earnings to a separate component of equity called exchange reserve.
FKI plc has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative exchange differences to be reset to zero at the transition date.
reclassification of the UK GAAP accrual relating to the Long Term Incentive Plans LTIPs from profit and loss account to a separate component of equity called the share-based payment accrual.
