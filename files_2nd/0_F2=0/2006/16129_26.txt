At 31 December 2006, the review was undertaken on a value-in-use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets, using cash flow projections in respect of periods to 2015 discounted at 7.52% 2005: 6.95%.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and cost growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets and projections for 2008 to 2015 from the Business Review.
The cash flow forecasts reflect the risk associated with each asset.
Cash flows from years beyond 2015 are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Management believes it is appropriate to forecast for a period of greater than five years to most appropriately reflect the length of the capital investment cycle.

In accordance with accounting standards IAS 36, the Group tests the carrying value of other intangible assets with indefinite economic lives for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently if there are indicators that other intangible assets are impaired.
The impairment review of the carrying value of the Groups intangible assets performed at the interim reporting date indicated that an impairment charge was required.
The impairment charge reduces the carrying value of the Regional newspaper publishing rights and titles relating to the Midlands and London and the South East by 250.0 million 2005: nil before tax.
Net of tax, the impairment reduces the carrying value of the Regional newspaper publishing rights and titles by 175.0 million 2005: nil.
The customer relationships and domain names included above have finite estimated useful lives of between five and ten years.

Value in use was based on net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets, using cash flow projections in respect of periods to 2055, and fair value less costs to sell was based on managements estimate of the valuation of the intangible assets based on previous market transactions in the sector and other valuation methods.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the period to 2015.
The discount rate used at 31 December 2006 was 7.52% 2005: 6.95% reflecting a long-term equity and debt mix based on the year-end Enterprise Value assuming a long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of three times.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets and the projections for 2008 to 2015 from the Business Review.
The cash flow forecasts reflect past experience of and the risk associated with each asset.
Operating cash flows beyond 2015 are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth estimated for the relevant markets.
Investment cash flows have been forecast to reflect the cycle of capital investment required, including printing press replacement.

34 Share-based payments Executive share option scheme The Company operates an existing share option scheme under which Executive Directors and senior management are granted options.
However, following the introduction of the Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2004 no further options have been granted under this scheme.
Options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant subject to the continued employment of the participant and achievement of earnings per share performance.
In addition, 50% of each grant of an option to each individual is subject to a total shareholder return comparison against the FTSE Mid-250 index of companies on the date of grant.
The other 50% is subject to a comparison of total shareholder return with a group of about 20 other media companies.
No vesting of options will take place unless the Companys ranking is at least median.

The expected life of the options used in the model is a weighted average driven by simulated share price movements in the model.
Long-Term Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Award Plan Under these schemes, the Remuneration Committee can recommend the grant of awards of shares to an eligible employee.
Awards could take the form of either Performance Shares, Matching Shares or Deferred Shares.
Full details of how the scheme operates are explained on page 41 of the Remuneration Report.
The vesting of Performance Shares granted in 2004 and 2005 is conditional upon the achievement of two performance conditions.
Up to 50% of an award can vest provided that earnings per share growth exceeds a range of targets above inflation.
The remaining 50% vests if targets measuring the Companys total shareholder return against the performance of a comparator group of companies are met.
The Performance Shares granted in 2006 vest if targets measuring the Companys total shareholder return against the performance of a comparator group of companies are met.
The Matching Shares granted in 2005 and 2006 vest provided that earnings per share growth exceeds a range of targets above inflation.
The Deferred Shares have no performance conditions.

The Group recognised a credit of 1.8 million 2005: 4.4 million expense related to share-based payments during the period.
The credit of 1.8 million represents a charge of 2.4 million in respect of the awards made in 2006 and a release of 4.2 million in respect of awards made in 2004 and 2005 due to adjustment for non-market-based factors.
35 Retirement benefit schemes Defined benefit schemes The Group operates ten final salary pension schemes.
Two of the schemes, namely the Mirror Group Pension Scheme the Old Scheme and the MGN Past Service Pension Scheme the Past Service Scheme cover the liabilities in respect of service up to 13 February 1992, the date when the Old Scheme was closed.
The Past Service Scheme was established to meet the liabilities for service up to 13 February 1992 for employees and former employees, who worked regularly on the production and distribution of Mirror Groups newspapers, which are not satisfied by payments from the Old Scheme and the Maxwell Communications Pension Plan or by the State.
These schemes have formal actuarial valuations carried out regularly.
The actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate their assets and liabilities vary according to actuarial and funding policies adjusted by the Trustees.
The last formal valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2004 and showed that they have insufficient assets to meet their liabilities for members benefits.
Following this, agreement was reached with the Trustee to pay 12.5 million into the Past Service Scheme in 2006 2005: 9.0 million.
For 2007, agreement has been reached with the Trustees to pay 12.5 million.
The next full actuarial valuation will be carried out during 2007.
Formal valuations of the other eight final salary schemes are carried out regularly, with the actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate each schemes assets and liabilities varying according to the actuarial and funding policies adopted by their respective trustees.
The most significant of the schemes are the Trinity Retirement Benefit Scheme the Trinity Scheme, the MGN Pension Scheme the MGN Scheme and the Midland Independent Newspapers Pension Scheme the MIN Scheme, which together with the Old Scheme and the Past Service Scheme represent over 97% of the aggregate market value.
The last formal valuation of these schemes was undertaken on 30 June 2003 for the Trinity Scheme a full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2006 is being carried out, 31 March 2004 for the MIN Scheme and 31 December 2004 for the MGN Scheme.
These valuations showed deficits of 25.1 million, 30.8 million and 55.9 million respectively.
All of the schemes are being funded in accordance with the recommendations of the respective actuaries, including deficit funding in 2006 of 2.5 million 2005: 2.5 million, 7.0 million 2005: 4.5 million and 4.5 million 2005: 4.5 million respectively.
In 2006, the employers contribution rate to the MGN Scheme was increased by 0.9% to 12.0%.
The employers contribution rate to the Trinity Scheme remained at 14%.
The employers contribution rate to the MIN Scheme remained at 15%.
The actuarial valuation of the Trinity Scheme as at 30 June 2006 will be finalised during 2007.
The next full actuarial valuations for the MIN Scheme and the MGN Scheme will be carried out during 2007.
During 2002, the decision was taken to close entry to the three defined benefit final salary pension schemes to new employees with effect from 1 January 2003.
All new employees are entitled to participate in a defined contribution plan, the Trinity Mirror Pension Plan.
Valuations have been performed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 with scheme liabilities calculated using a consistent projected unit valuation method and compared to the market value of the schemes assets at 29 December 2006, the last day prior to the period end for which such values were available.
