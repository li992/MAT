A Ac cc co ou un nt tiin ng g f fo or r f fo or re eiig gn n c cu ur rr re en nc cy y a an nd d f fiin na an nc ciia all iin ns st tr ru um me en nt ts s Victrex has a policy of taking out forward foreign currency contracts to cover forecast foreign currency income streams providing medium term predictability in its results.
Under UK GAAP, Victrex used the effective exchange rates from the forward contracts for translation of its foreign currency transactions and, where appropriate, the consolidation of its overseas entities.
Under IFRS, Victrex continues to hedge account as defined by IAS 19 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement resulting in largely unchanged profit and loss recognition.
However, IAS did require changes to the mechanics of how this is achieved: Under IAS 21 - Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, all transactions and consolidations are recognised using spot rates: Under IAS 39 the fair value of foreign currency contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.
Victrex has adopted hedge accounting and therefore the movement in fair value is deferred in a hedging reserve until the associated transaction occurs at which point the cumulative movement is released to the income statement.
Whilst the above did not materially affect overall profitability, there were minor changes in categorisation within the detail with a reduction in revenue of 702,000 offset by a reduction in cost of sales 235,000 and indirect overheads of 384,000 in the year ended 30 September 2005.
V VIIC CT TR RE EX X p pllc c Annual Report & Accounts 2006 59 The opening consolidated balance sheet as at 1 October 2004 recognises a financial asset of 1,543,000 and a financial liability of 426,000, which account for the fair value of derivative financial instruments forward contracts.
The corresponding hedging reserve is 542,000, which reflects the fair value of forward contracts relating to future transactions at the balance sheet date.
These are offset by the effects of revaluing all balance sheet categories to closing spot rates.
The consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2005 recognises a financial asset of 1,437,000, a financial liability of 1,010,000 and a corresponding hedging reserve of 228,000.
As a first time adopter, Victrex has taken advantage of the IFRS 1 - First time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards exemption to deem as zero at the date of transition to IFRS the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations.
G Go oo od dw wiillll a am mo or rt tiis sa at tiio on n Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised by equal instalments over its estimated useful economic life.
However, under IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, amortisation of goodwill is prohibited but is replaced by a requirement for annual impairment testing.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption whereby IFRS 3 can be applied prospectively from the date of transition, hence removing the need to restate the previous business combinations.
The carrying value of goodwill on the opening IFRS consolidated balance sheet has therefore been restricted to that 3,475,000 net carrying amount previously reported under UK GAAP.
The profit impact of this adjustment in the year ended 30 September 2005 is a credit of 662,000, being the reversal of amortisation previously charged under UK GAAP on the goodwill which arose on the acquisition of the DFDPM business from Laporte in 1999 note that there is no change in the treatment of knowhow arising from that transaction.
On 1 April 2005 Victrex purchased certain operations from Degussa AG.
This included the purchase of goodwill which, in accordance with IFRS, will not be amortised, but will be subject to annual impairment testing.
The profit impact of this adjustment in 2005 is a credit of 198,000, being the reversal of amortisation previously charged under UK GAAP.
S Sh ha ar re e- -b ba as se ed d p pa ay ym me en nt ts s Under UK GAAP, there is no charge to the profit and loss account relating to options granted under the Victrex 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, the Victrex 2005 Executive Share Option Plan, the Victrex 1995 Sharesave Scheme, the Victrex 2005 UK Sharesave Plan or Stock Purchase Plan.
As regards the LTIP, under UK GAAP, the profit and loss account is charged over the performance period with an amount equal to the market price on the date of the award, subject to meeting performance targets.
However, IFRS 2 - Share-based Payment, requires that the fair value of all such relevant instruments granted since 7 November 2002, which had not vested by 1 January 2005, be charged to the income statement over the relevant option vesting periods adjusted for actual and expected levels.
Fair values have been calculated using the recognised Stochastic options valuation model.
Victrex receives a tax credit, as appropriate, which relates to share options and awards when exercised, based on the gains the award holders make.
A deferred tax asset representing an estimate of the future tax relief for this gain has to be recognised under IFRS and is based on the potential gains available to the option or award holders at the balance sheet date.
The profit impact of this adjustment in the year ended 30 September 2005 is a net charge of 139,000, offset by a deferred tax credit of 636,000.
A corresponding deferred tax asset of 636,000 has been recognised at 30 September 2005.
B Bo or rr ro ow wiin ng g c co os st ts s Under IAS 23 - Borrowing Costs, unamortised borrowing costs have been written off.
J Ja ap pa an ne es se e jjo oiin nt t v five en nt tu ur re e The Japanese joint venture continues to be included in the income statement on the equity accounting basis, but as a single line item of profit after tax under IFRS as opposed to the three lines of profit before interest and tax, interest and taxation under UK GAAP.

However, under IAS 12 - Income Taxes, this discounted basis in not permitted and hence the deferred tax provision has to be stated at the gross amount.
The effect on the opening consolidated balance sheet is an increase in the deferred tax provision of 1,760,000.
The impact on the year ended 30 September 2005 results is an increased deferred tax charge of 820,000 and the resulting adjustment to the closing consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2005 is an increase in the deferred tax provision of 2,580,000.
In addition, IAS 12 requires separate recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Group balance sheet.
IAS 12 is also more prescriptive than UK GAAP and hence additional deferred tax assets of 711,000 and 943,000 have been recognised in the opening and 30 September 2005 consolidated balance sheets respectively.
The impact on the year ended 30 September 2005 results is a decreased deferred tax charge of 232,000.
The specific deferred taxation impact of changes in accounting for share-based payments and pensions are set out in the respective notes.
P Pe en ns siio on ns s Under UK GAAP, Victrex has accounted for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 - Accounting for Pension Costs, which spreads the costs of the defined benefit section of Victrex's principal scheme over the employees' working lives within the Group.
Victrex has also made additional disclosures giving details of the pension fund deficit, liabilities and operating charges on the valuation methodologies in accordance with FRS 17 - Retirement Benefits.
IAS 19 - Employee Benefits requires the actuarial deficit arising under the defined benefit pension scheme to be recognised on the balance sheet based on the fair valuations of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
The movement in deficit as a result of current service cost, contributions and other finance expenditure has to be recognised in the income statement and Victrex has taken advantage of the option under IAS 19 to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of recognised income and expense as opposed to the income statement.
Note that similar adjustments would have been required under UK GAAP once FRS 17 becomes fully applicable.
Consequently, a deficit of 8,184,000 and a corresponding deferred tax asset of 2,455,000 have been recognised on the balance sheet at the date of transition.
A deficit of 7,812,000 and a corresponding deferred tax asset of 2,344,000 have been recognised on the balance sheet at 30 September 2005.
D Diiv viid fide en nd d r re ec co og gn niit tiio on n Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends are recognised in the financial results for the period in which they relate, but under IFRS, a dividend can only be recognised if it has been formally declared during the accounting period being reported.
