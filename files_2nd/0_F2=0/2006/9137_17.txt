The principal financial relate to revenue and profit recognition and the valuation of assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows: defined pension scheme assets and liabilities.

b Defined benefit pension scheme valuations Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme initial value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been irrecoverable amounts.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, expected return on plan assets particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and recorded at their fair value.

Details of the assumptions used are included in note 8. c Bank and other borrowings Interest bearing bank and other loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
d Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting change in fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument.
A number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk under cash flow hedges, which are initially recognised at fair value.
The effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit or loss.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against transactional foreign currency exposures.
In cases where these derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above.
Where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.

Kier Group Pension Scheme This is the principal Scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan.
The assets of the Scheme are held under trust separately from those of the Group: the Trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002, existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken by the Trustees independent actuaries as at 1 April 2005 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the Schemes assets at that date were 369.8m which represented approximately 82% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 46.5m 2005: 24.5m which include special contributions of 31.5m 2005: 12.0m.
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2005 valuation date not covered by the above special contributions over a 10-year period to March 2016.
The Group expects to pay contributions for future service of 13.2m being 19.1% of pensionable pay plus 11.0m for funding the past service deficit of which 5.5m was paid in July 2006 in the year to June 2007.
The Pension Protection Fund PPF levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution arrangement.
The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance with the rates specified in the Plan.
The contributions paid to the Retirement Savings Plan during the year and the pension charge, amounted to 2.6m 2005: 1.8m.
Kier Sheffield LLP Kier participates in this defined benefits scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in the South Yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003.
As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and ongoing past service liabilities of 65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Councils employment to Kier Sheffield LLP upon the start of the contract.
New employees are offered membership of the Retirement Savings Plan section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.

LTIP Awards made under the scheme are normally able to vest following the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing, and is subject to the Company achieving specific performance targets.
The awards may be taken as shares or as a combination of shares and cash based on the share price prevailing when the shares vest.
The share element of the award are intended to be satisfied from the following shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust rather than from the issue of new shares.
These shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings.
The dividends on these shares have been waived.
A description of these schemes and the terms and conditions of each scheme are included in the directors remuneration report on page 42.
Value of share schemes The fair value per option granted has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: Sharesave LTIP LTIP LTIP scheme 2004 award 2005 award 2006 award 29 October 1October 1December 3October Date of grant 2003 2003 2004 2005 Share price at grant 604.5p 627.5p 699.0p 1065.0p Exercise price 625.0p nil nil nil Option life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected volatility 27.8% N A N A N A Dividend yield 3.0% 2.9% 2.8% 2.0% Risk-free interest rate 4.8% N A N A N A Value per option 114.0p 578.0p 633.0p 1043.0p The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

26 Financial instruments Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counter-parties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counter-party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter-party are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Interest rate risk The Group has hedged its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of 30.1m of loan notes for 10 years from February 2003, which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p. a.
The balance of the Groups borrowings are to finance short-term working capital requirements.
Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Groups PFI and Property joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.

Interest bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2006 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 137.4m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2006 amounted to 4.5m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 1.3m, has been treated as an effective hedge and recognised directly in equity.

31 Explanation of transition to IFRS These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements, including comparative information for the year to 30 June 2005 and in preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 July 2004 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet and comparative information for the year to 30 June 2005, the Group has adjusted amounts previously reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
In addition, following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group has adjusted previously restated total equity at 1 July 2005.
The reconciliation of total equity at 1 July 2004 and 30 June 2005 is as follows: 30 June 2005 I July 2004 m m Total equity as previously reported under UK GAAP 147.4 116.4 Adjustments on adoption of IFRS Employee benefits 93.7 64.8 Sales and marketing costs 3.9 2.6 Deferred land payments 1.1 Property transactions 0.3 Proposed dividends 5.4 4.6 Deferred taxation 2.0 2.1 Share-based payments 0.1 Goodwill not amortised 0.6 Total equity under IFRS 52.8 51.2 The reconciliation of total equity at 1 July 2005 following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is as follows: m Total equity as reported under IFRS at 30 June 2005 52.8 Adjustments on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 Group share of fair value on interest rate swaps in PFI joint ventures 8.5 Fair value of other cash flow hedges 1.0 7.5 Deferred tax on above 2.2 Total IAS 32 and IAS 39 adjustments 5.3 Total equity under IFRS at 1 July 2005 47.5 The reconciliation of profits for the year to 30 June 2005 is as follows: Year to 30 June 2005 m Profit for the year after tax under UK GAAP 37.8 Adjustments on adoption of IFRS Employee benefits 0.1 Sales and marketing costs 1.3 Deferred land payments 1.1 Property transactions 0.3 Deferred taxation 0.2 Goodwill not amortised 0.6 Total IFRS adjustments 1.2 Profit for the year under IFRS 36.6 72 Kier Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS, continued The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS for the Group are: a Employee benefits Under UK GAAP the Group accounted for its defined benefit schemes in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The cost of providing the defined benefit pensions was charged against operating profit with surpluses and deficits arising in the funds amortised to operating profit over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
Under IAS 19 the cost of providing pension benefits current service cost for defined benefit pensions schemes is recognised in profit or loss, together with the interest cost arising on the projected obligations, returns on scheme assets and past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is determined bi-annually by independent actuaries and recognised on the balance sheet.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
b Sales and marketing costs Under UK GAAP sales and marketing costs for the Residential and Property divisions are capitalised in site work in progress and written off through cost of sales as the site progresses.
Under IAS 2 Inventories costs relating to sales and marketing activities are required to be written off as incurred.
c Deferred land payments Under UK GAAP deferred land payments land creditors are included in creditors at their gross value.
Under IAS 2 imputed interest is recognised on deferred land payments with the result that the land creditors are carried in the balance sheet at net present value and the value of land held on the balance sheet in inventories is reduced.
The unwinding of the imputed interest or discount on land creditors is charged to finance cost and the reduction in land values in inventories will result in an eventual reduction in cost of sales as the land is traded out.
d Property transactions Under UK GAAP where property developments are sold in advance of construction, turnover and profit are recognised over the life of the contract in accordance with SSAP 9 Stocks and Long-Term Contracts.
Under IAS 18 Revenue, where property developments are sold in advance of construction being completed, revenue and profit are recognised from the point of sale, and as the significant outstanding acts of construction and development are completed.
e Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP as applicable for the year ended 30 June 2005, proposed dividends were recognised as a liability in the period to which they relate.
Under IAS 10 dividends are not recognised as a liability until they are appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
f Deferred taxation IAS 12 Income Taxes requires deferred tax to be recognised on all temporary differences and not just timing differences as previously under UK GAAP.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full but deferred tax assets are only recognised if future taxable profits are available to cover the assets.
g Share-based payments As permitted by the exemption from retrospective application in IFRS 1, the Group has adopted IFRS 2 for all payments granted after 7 November 2002.
This requires that share-based payments granted after that date, but not vested, should be valued at the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
This affects the Sharesave and Long-Term Incentive Plan schemes.
The fair value of these shares at date of award is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
h Goodwill and intangible assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life in the case of Kier for up to 10 years tested for impairment and provided for as necessary.
Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill is no longer amortised but is carried at cost and subject to annual review for impairment at 30 June.
It is effectively frozen at June 2004 with amounts amortised subsequently under UK GAAP being reinstated.
At June 2004 the Group balance sheet contained 18.6m of goodwill.
13.4m of this relates to the business and assets of the Construction and Building Services operation of Sheffield City Council.
This has been reclassified from goodwill to intangible assets in respect of contract rights under IFRS and will continue to be amortised on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the contract.
The balance of 5.2m relates to the acquisition of Partnerships First in 2002.
This balance has been maintained at the 30 June 2004 carrying value.
