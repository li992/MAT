b Other related party transactions Tim Ryan was the chief executive officer of Bell Pottinger Corporate and Financial.
During the earlier part of the period Bell Pottinger acted as the Groups financial PR company.
Tim Ryan was not involved in the process of selecting Bell Pottinger in this role and played no part in the arrangement of fees with Bell Pottinger.

Contingent consideration up to 5.0 million in cash is payable dependent upon the number of new game units released in excess of 2.1 million units per annum over the four year period following completion.

4 During the year the Group commissioned a royalty audit with regard to games distributed by a third party during the period from August 2003 to January 2006.
Findings from the audit have shown that monies are owed to the Group in respect of the titles distributed throughout this period.
There is a contingent asset of up to 0.6 million and this should be settled within the next year.

Post balance sheet event In July 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 25% of Proein SL not previously held.
At the same time it sold its 26.7% stake in Pyro Studios SL.
