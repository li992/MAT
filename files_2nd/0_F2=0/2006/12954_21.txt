The financial statements were approved by the board of directors on 13 March 2007 and are signed on its behalf by: P Litard DM Bristow Chairman Chief executive Jersey, Channel Islands 13 March 2007 60 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 Financial statements Financial statements Profitability enables us not only to reward our shareholders but to reinvest earnings in our future growth.
Report of the independent auditors to the Members of Randgold Resources Limited We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Randgold Resources Limited the company which comprise the standalone balance sheet of the company and consolidated balance sheet of the company and its subsidiaries the group as of 31 December 2006 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The companys directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and with the requirements of Companies Jersey Law 1991.
This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error: selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies: and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
AUDITORS RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
OPINION In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company and the group as of 31 December 2006, and of the financial performance and cash flows of the group for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and with the requirements of Companies Jersey Law 1991.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER Without qualifying our opinion we draw attention to note 24 to the financial statements.
The recovery of a US$12.1 million loan to MDM Ferroman Pty Ltd MDM in liquidation, the main contractor responsible for construction of the Loulo mine until the construction contract was taken back on 30 December 2005, is dependent on the amount which can be recovered from various performance bonds, personal guarantees and other assets provided as security and, if this proves to be insufficient, the outcome of the liquidation of MDM.
In addition, the directors believe the group is entitled to recover US$47.2 million from MDM in respect of additional costs incurred on the Loulo development project and damages arising from the delayed completion of the project.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, and the financial statements do not reflect any provision that may be required if the US$12.1 million receivable cannot be recovered in full or any adjustments that may arise from the claim against MDM referred to above.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the companys members as a body in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We also, at the request of the directors because the company applies the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules as if it were a listed company in the United Kingdom, review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the companys compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Financial Reporting Council Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.

The interests of the group in its operating mines are held through Morila SA Morila which owns the Morila mine and Somilo SA Somilo which owns the Loulo mine.
Randgold Resources holds an effective 40% interest in Morila, following the sale to AngloGold Ashanti Limited on 3 July 2000 of one half of Randgold Resources wholly owned subsidiary, Morila Limited.
Management of Morila Limited, the 80% shareholder of Morila, is effected through a joint venture committee, with Randgold Resources and AngloGold Ashanti each appointing one half of the members of the committee.
AngloGold Services Mali SA Anser, a subsidiary of AngloGold Ashanti, is the operator of Morila.
Randgold Resources holds an effective 80% interest in Loulo.

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The company changed its accounting policy on stripping costs in 2006.
BASIS OF PREPARATION: The consolidated financial statements of Randgold Resources Limited and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements and balance sheet for the company have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and various financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the companys accounting policies.
The areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
The following standards and interpretations which have been recently issued or revised have not been adopted early by the group.
Their expected impact is discussed below: IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 The objective of this IFRS is to require entities to disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which it engages and the economic environments in which it operates.
The company will apply IFRS 8 from 1 January 2009, but it is not expected to have any impact on the accounts of the company or group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosure effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 The objective of this IFRS is to require entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for the entitys financial position: and the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the reporting date, and how the entity manages those risks.
The effect of the adoption of the standard is currently being assessed: however a significant impact on disclosures is expected.
IFRIC Interpretation 8 Scope of IFRS 2 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006 The interpretation determines whether IFRS 2 applies to transactions in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received.
The company will apply IFRIC 8 from 1 January 2007, but it is not expected to have any impact on the accounts of the company or group.
IFRIC Interpretation 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006 The interpretation applies to all embedded derivatives under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and clarifies certain aspects of their treatment.
The company will apply IFRIC 9 from 1 January 2007, but it is not expected to have any impact on the accounts of the company or group.
IFRIC Interpretation 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006 An entity is required to assess goodwill for impairment at every reporting date, to assess investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost for impairment at every balance sheet date and, if required, to recognise an impairment loss at that date in accordance with IAS 36 and IAS 39.
However, at a subsequent reporting or balance sheet date, conditions may have so changed that the impairment loss would have been reduced or avoided had the impairment assessment been made only at that date.
This Interpretation provides guidance on whether such impairment losses should ever be reversed.
The company will apply IFRIC 10 from 1 January 2007, but it is not expected to have any impact on the accounts of the company or group.
IFRIC Interpretation 11 IFRS 2 Share-based Payment - Group and Treasury Share Transactions effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007 This interpretation addresses the classification of a share-based payment transaction as equityor cash-settled, in which equity instruments of the parent or another group entity are transferred, in the financial statements of the entity receiving 66 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 the services.
The company will apply IFRIC 11 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the accounts of the company or group.
IFRIC Interpretation 12 Service Concession Arrangements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 This interpretation provides guidance to private sector entities on certain recognition and measurement issues that arise in accounting for public to private service concession arrangements.
The company will apply IFRIC 12 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the accounts of the company or group.
The following standards are not relevant to the group and had no impact on adoption: IFRIC Interpretation 6 Liabilities arising from participation in a specific market - waste electrical and electrical equipment effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 December 2005 IFRIC Interpretation 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006 The group has adopted the following standards and interpretations which are effective for the first time this year without any significant impact: IAS 19 Amendment - Actuarial gains and losses and disclosures January 2006 IFRIC Interpretation 4 - Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease effective 1 January 2006 IFRIC Interpretation 5 - Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds effective 1 January 2006 CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial information includes the financial statements of the company, its subsidiaries and the companys proportionate share in its joint ventures using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.
SUBSIDIARIES: Subsidiaries are entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying an interest of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired including mineral property interests and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
JOINT VENTURES: Joint ventures are those entities in which the group holds a long term interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or more venturers under a contractual arrangement.
The groups interest in such jointly controlled entities is accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
Under this method the group includes its share of the joint ventures individual income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows on a line by line basis with similar items in the groups financial statements.
Inter company accounts and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets by the group to the joint venture that is attributable to the other venturers.
The group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the purchase of assets by the group from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an independent party.
However, if a loss on the transaction provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment loss, the loss is recognised immediately.
The results of joint ventures are included from the effective dates of acquisition and up to the effective dates of disposal.
SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES: Special purpose entities SPEs are those undertakings that are created to satisfy specific business needs of the group under which the group has the right to the majority of the benefits of the SPE and or is exposed to risk incident to the activities thereof.
SPEs are consolidated in the same manner as subsidiaries when the substance of the relationship indicates that the SPE is controlled by the group.
SEGMENT REPORTING: A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in performing mining or other services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographic segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The group has only one business segment, that of gold mining.
Segment analysis is based on individual mining operations.
Corporate and exploration income and costs not directly related to the mining operations are not allocated to segments.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the companys functional and presentation currency.
Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 67 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences on equities held at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are included in the fair value reserve in equity.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: a Undeveloped properties Undeveloped properties upon which the group has not performed sufficient exploration work to determine whether significant mineralisation exists are carried at original acquisition cost.
Where the directors consider that there is little likelihood of the properties being exploited, or the value of the exploitable rights has diminished below cost, an impairment is recorded.
b Development costs and mine plant facilities Development costs and mine plant facilities are initially recorded at cost.
Where relevant the estimated cost of dismantling the asset and remediating the site is included in the cost of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequently they are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Development costs and mine plant facilities relating to existing and new mines are capitalised.
Development costs consist primarily of direct expenditure incurred to establish or expand productive capacity, and are capitalised until saleable minerals are extracted from the orebody at which point the costs are depreciated over the life of the mine.
c Non-mining assets Non-mining assets are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
d Depreciation and amortisation Long-lived assets include mining properties, such as freehold land, metallurgical plant, tailings and raw water dams, power plant and mine infrastructure, as well as mine development costs.
Depreciation and amortisation are charged over the life of the mine or over the remaining useful life of the asset, if shorter based on estimated ore tonnes contained in proved and probable reserves, to reduce the cost to estimated residual values.
Proved and probable ore reserves reflect estimated quantities of economically recoverable reserves, which can be recovered in the future from known mineral deposits.
Total proved and probable reserves are used in the depreciation calculation.
The remaining useful lives for Morila and Loulo are estimated at six and a minimum of eighteen years respectively.
Any changes to the expected life of the mine or asset are applied prospectively in calculating depreciation and amortisation charges.
Short-lived assets which include motor vehicles, office equipment and computer equipment, are depreciated over estimated useful lives of between two to five years but limited to the remaining mine life.
e Mining property valuations The carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment of the group is compared to the recoverable amount of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less cost to sell.
In assessing the value in use, the expected future cash flows from the assets is determined by applying a discount rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash flows.
The discount rate used is derived from the groups weighted average cost of capital.
An impairment is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets recoverable amount.
The revised carrying amounts are amortised in line with group accounting policies.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the impairment.
This reversal is recognised in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units for purposes of assessing impairment.
The estimates of future discounted cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties including the future gold price.
It is therefore reasonably possible that changes could occur which may affect the recoverability of mining assets.
STRIPPING COSTS: All stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are treated as variable production costs and as a result are included in the cost of inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred.
INVENTORIES: Include ore stockpiles, gold in process and supplies and spares, and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of ore stockpiles and gold produced is determined principally by the weighted average cost method using related production costs.
Costs of gold inventories include all costs incurred up until production of an ounce of gold such as milling costs, mining costs and directly attributable mine general and administration costs but exclude transport costs, refining costs and royalties.
Net realisable value is determined with reference to current market prices.
Stockpiles consist of two types of ore, high grade and medium grade ore, which will be processed through the processing plant.
In the case of Morila, high grade ore is defined as ore above 4g t and medium grade is defined as ore above 1.6g t. For Loulo, high grade ore is defined as ore above 3.7g t and medium grade is defined as ore above 1.5g t. Both high and medium grade stockpiles 68 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 are currently being processed and all ore is expected to be fully processed.
The processing of ore in stockpiles occurs in accordance with the life of mine processing plan that has been optimised based on the known mineral reserves, current plant capacity and mine design.
Stores and materials consist of consumable stores and are valued at weighted average cost after appropriate impairment of redundant and slow moving items.
INTEREST BORROWING COST: Is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the period to maturity.
Borrowing cost is expensed as incurred except to the extent that it relates to the construction of property, plant and equipment during the time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use, when it is capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: These are measured as set out below.
Financial instruments carried on the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, receivables, accounts payable, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURE: Are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment in the financial statements of the company.
Dividends are accounted for when the company becomes entitled to receive them.
On the disposal of an investment, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to the income statement.
DERIVATIVES: Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs on the date a derivative contract is entered into trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value, unless they meet the criteria for the normal purchases normal sales exemption.
On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the group normally designates the derivative for accounting purposes as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecast transaction cash flow hedge - although certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the groups risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item, and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are included in the income statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects net profit or loss.
This applies even if the derivative is rolled forward on maturity and designated as a hedge of a different forecast transaction so that gains losses relating to the original forecast transaction are recognised in the income statement when that transaction affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement.
The group formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
This process includes linking derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific forecast transactions.
The group formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
The group does not have any fair value hedges.
Derivatives are derecognised when the right to receive or the obligation to pay cash has expired or has been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
RECEIVABLES: Are recognised initially at fair value.
There is a rebuttable presumption that the transaction price is fair value unless this could be refuted by reference to market indicators.
Subsequently, receivables are measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and bank overdrafts.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are included in borrowings in current liabilities.
REHABILITATION COSTS: The net present value of estimated future rehabilitation costs is provided for in the financial statements and capitalised within mining assets on initial recognition.
Rehabilitation will generally occur on closure or after closure of a mine.
Initial recognition is at the time of the disturbance occurring and thereafter as and when additional disturbances take place.
The estimates are reviewed annually to take into account the effects of inflation and changes in estimates and are discounted using rates that reflect the time value of money.
Annual increases in the provision due to the unwinding of the discount are recognised in the income statement as a finance cost.
The present value of additional disturbances and changes in the estimate of the rehabilitation liability are capitalised to mining assets against an increase in the rehabilitation provision.
The rehabilitation asset is amortised as noted previously.
Rehabilitation projects undertaken, included in the estimates, are charged to the provision as incurred.
Environmental liabilities, other than rehabilitation costs, which relate to liabilities arising from specific events, are expensed when they are known, probable and may be reasonably estimated.
Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED PROVISIONS: Are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
BORROWINGS: Are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE: Are stated at cost adjusted for payments made to reflect the value of the anticipated economic outflow of resources.
DEFERRED TAXATION: Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS: a Pension obligations The group has defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered provident funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to present value.
c Profit sharing and bonus plans The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses.
The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
d Share-based payments The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options or shares after 7 November 2002 is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed rateably over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or shares determined at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable or the number of shares that the employee will ultimately receive.
This estimate is revised at each balance sheet date and the difference is charged or credited to the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received on exercise of the options net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to equity.
FINANCE LEASES: Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Leases of plant and equipment where the group assumes a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are classified as a finance lease.
Finance leases are capitalised at the estimated present value of the underlying lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and the finance charges to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The interest portion of the finance payment is charged to the income statement over the lease period.
The plant and equipment acquired under the finance lease are depreciated over the useful lives of the assets, or over the lease term if shorter.
OPERATING LEASES: Determining whether an arrangement is an operating lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset 70 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: The company enters into contracts for the sale of gold.
Revenue arising from gold sales under these contracts is recognised when the price is determinable, the product has been delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured.
These criteria are met when the gold leaves the mines smelt house.
As sales from gold contracts are subject to customer survey adjustment, sales are initially recorded on a provisional basis using the groups best estimate of the contained metal.
Subsequent adjustments are recorded in revenue to take into account final assay and weight certificates from the refinery, if different from the initial certificates.
The differences between the estimated and actual contained gold have not been significant historically.
EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION COSTS: The group expenses all exploration and evaluation expenditures until the directors conclude that a future economic benefit is more likely than not of being realised, ie.
While the criteria for concluding that an expenditure should be capitalised is always probable, the information that the directors use to make that determination depends on the level of exploration.
a Exploration and evaluation expenditure on greenfield sites, being those where the group does not have any mineral deposits which are already being mined or developed, is expensed as incurred until a final feasibility study has been completed, after which the expenditure is capitalised within development costs if the final feasibility study demonstrates that future economic benefits are probable.
b Exploration and evaluation expenditure on brownfield sites, being those adjacent to mineral deposits which are already being mined or developed, is expensed as incurred until the directors are able to demonstrate that future economic benefits are probable through the completion of a prefeasibility study, after which the expenditure is capitalised as a mine development cost.
A prefeasibility study consists of a comprehensive study of the viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where the mining method, in the case of underground mining, or the pit configuration, in the case of an open pit, has been established, and which, if an effective method of mineral processing has been determined, includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions of technical, engineering, operating economic factors and the evaluation of other relevant factors.
The prefeasibility study, when combined with existing knowledge of the mineral property that is adjacent to mineral deposits that are already being mined or developed, allow the directors to conclude that it is more likely than not that the group will obtain future economic benefit from the expenditures.
c Exploration and evaluation expenditure relating to extensions of mineral deposits which are already being mined or developed, including expenditure on the definition of mineralisation of such mineral deposits, is capitalised as a mine development cost following the completion of an economic evaluation equivalent to a prefeasibility study.
This economic evaluation is distinguished from a prefeasibility study in that some of the information that would normally be determined in a prefeasibility study is instead obtained from the existing mine or development.
This information, when combined with existing knowledge of the mineral property already being mined or developed, allows the directors to conclude that it is more likely than not the group will obtain future economic benefit from the expenditures.
Costs relating to property acquisitions are also capitalised.
These costs are capitalised within development costs.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION: Dividend distribution to the companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividend is declared by the board of directors.
EARNINGS PER SHARE: Is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
FULLY DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE: Is presented when the inclusion of potential ordinary shares has a dilutive effect on earnings per share.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS Some of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgement by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
By their nature, these judgements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, managements view on trends in the gold mining industry and information from outside sources.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Future rehabilitation obligations The net present value of current rehabilitation estimates have been discounted to their present value at 6% per annum 2005: 6% for Morila, being an estimate of the cost of borrowings.
A 6.5% 2005: 5.5% discount rate was used for Loulo.
Expenditure is expected to be incurred at the end of the respective mine lives.
Determination of ore reserves There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves being restated.
Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 2006 2005 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED Gold price assumptions The following gold prices were used in the mineral reserves optimisation calculations: Morila US$475 US$425 Loulo: Openpit US$475 US$390 Loulo: Underground US$475 US$420 Uncertainties relating to transactions with a contractor As explained in note 24 to the financial statements, there are uncertainties relating to the recoverability of advances to a contractor and also a claim relating to the Loulo development.
The financial statements reflect the directors best estimate of the amount that will be recovered in respect of the advances.
No amounts have been recognised in respect of the rest of the claim against the contractor.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure The group has to apply judgement in determining whether exploration and evaluation expenditure should be capitalised or expensed, under the policy described in note 2.
Indirect taxes receivable Given their slow moving nature, the group has had to apply judgement in determining when amounts will be recovered with respect to indirect taxes owing to Morila and Loulo by the Mali Government.
The amounts reflected in the financial statements are based on the directors best estimate of the timing of the recovery of these amounts.
Depreciation There are several methods for calculating depreciation, i. e. the straight-line method, the units of production method using ounces produced and the units of production method using tonnes milled.
The directors believe that the tonnes milled method is the best indication of plant and infrastructure usage.
Derivative valuation The company uses valuations obtained from banks for the mark-to-market valuation of the hedge book.
The banks used the following key inputs in the valuations: 31 Dec 31 Dec 2006 2005 LIBOR rates 5.32 - 5.33% 4.39 - 4.84% Spot gold prices US$635.70 US$513.00 Gold lease rates 0.09 - 0.17% 0.10 - 0.14% Share-based payments Refer to note 17 for the key assumptions used in determining the value of share-based payments.

72 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2006 4 INCOME AND MINING TAXES CONTINUED The company is not subject to income tax in Jersey.
Morila SA benefited from a five year tax holiday until 14 November 2005.
Somilo SA also benefits from a five year tax holiday in Mali.
The tax holiday commenced on 8 November 2005.
The benefit of the tax holiday to the group was to increase its net profit by US$9.1 million 2005: US$22.6 million.
Accordingly, had the group not benefited from the tax holiday in Mali, earnings per share would have been reduced by US$0.14 and US$0.37 for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 2005 respectively.
Under Malian tax law, income tax is based on the greater of 35 per cent of taxable income or 0.75 per cent of gross revenue.
The Morila and Loulo operations have no assessable capital expenditure carry forwards or assessable tax losses, as at 31 December 2006 and 2005 respectively, for deduction against future mining income.

6 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY The company changed its accounting policy on stripping costs, under both IFRS and US GAAP, in the current year.
Previously, costs of production stage waste stripping in excess of the expected pit life average stripping ratio were deferred and then charged to production when the actual stripping ratio was below the expected pit life average stripping ratio.
Under the revised accounting policy, all stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are treated as variable production costs and as a result are included in the cost of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred.
Under US GAAP, EITF 04-06 Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry is effective for reporting periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
The consensus does not permit the deferral of any waste stripping costs during the production phase of a mine, but requires instead that they should be treated as variable production costs.
The directors have decided to adopt the same treatment under IFRS which will ensure that the accounting policies applied under IFRS and US GAAP remain in line.
With regard to the conclusions reached by the EITF, the directors believe the revised policy will mean that the financial statements provide reliable and more relevant information about the groups financial position and its financial performance.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the change in the IFRS policy has been applied retrospectively and hence the 2005 comparatives have been restated.

The remaining US$4 million relates to Morila 31 December 2005: US$3.9 million.
The net present value of estimated future rehabilitation costs is calculated using 6% 2005: 6% per annum for Morila, being an estimate derived from the risk free rate.
Limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali to govern mines, so the directors have based the provisions for environmental rehabilitation on standards set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up to date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its properties.
It makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
Current Life of Mine plans envisage the expected outflow to occur at the end of the Life of Mine, which is 2013 for Morila and 2024 for Loulo.
