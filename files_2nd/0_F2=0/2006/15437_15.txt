Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2006 1.
General information Taylor Woodrow plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered ofce is given on page 90.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 3 and in the Chief Executives Review on pages 5 to 27.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out on pages 48 and 49.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgments Site valuations and work in progress Internal site valuations are carried out at regular intervals throughout the year.
The valuations will include an estimation of the costs to complete and remaining revenues, in order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on the proportion of completions in the period, for each development.
In addition, the carrying value of work in progress can involve considerable judgment around future margins from sites in assessing whether any impairment provisions need to be recognised.
Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash generating unit, the future growth rate of revenue and costs, and a suitable discount rate.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 363.1m.
Contracting work profits in respect of contracts will be recognised by reference to the stage of completion when an estimate of a profitable outcome can be measured reliably.
Determining the outcome of a contract will require a survey.
This includes an estimate of the value of costs to complete and in certain instances estimates of the contract price as well as any variations in the contract work.
Contingent liabilities Note 31 describes an ongoing legal dispute in Florida.
In making its judgment management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of a provision set out in IAS 37, and in particular the existence of a present obligation.
Having taken legal advice, the directors are satisfied that recognition of a provision in the current year is not appropriate for all aspects of the dispute and that some of the circumstances give rise to a possible obligation whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence of uncertain future events.
Pensions Note 20 details the main assumptions made for the accounting of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes.
Tax Aspects of tax accounting require considerable management judgment and interpretation of tax legislation across many jurisdictions.

Business and geographical segments Business segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into four operating divisions Housing - United Kingdom, Housing North America, Housing Spain and Gibraltar, and Construction.
From 2006, the Property sector is no longer separately reported.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Segment information about these businesses is presented below.

However, for the purposes of the segmental analysis above the Group has allocated the deficit on the basis of members in the plan.
This allocation is performed solely for the purposes of providing a more meaningful segmental analysis and is not an appropriate apportionment in accordance with IAS 19.
The Groups housing divisions are already segmented geographically above.
The construction division is primarily located in the United Kingdom.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from trade receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts of 3.7m 2005: 2.7m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents This comprises of cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

Other financial assets continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and, trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is governed by Group policy that specifies the minimum credit rating, maximum exposure and maximum tenor.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

Secured bank loans and overdrafts totalled 14.5m 2005: 6.8m.
Secured bank loans and overdrafts are secured on certain fixed asset properties and land.
The directors estimate the fair value of the Groups bank borrowings to be equivalent to its book value.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had available 629.5m 2005: 685.0m of undrawn committed revolving credit facilities.

These notes were issued by way of a US$81m 6.59 per cent fixed rate US private placement.
The dollar proceeds were swapped into 49.5m at a fixed rate of interest of 7.04 per cent: A five year collar, limiting the three month LIBOR interest rate to between 3.99 per cent and 6.5 per cent on 30m expired in December 2006: A ten year interest swap to December 2012, acquired with Wilson Connolly in 2003, on 35m from floating rate to a fixed interest rate of 5.8 per cent: Forward contracts to hedge transaction risks and intra-group loans to buy US$1.2m and 16m against sterling.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of the Groups derivatives is a net debtor of 6.1m 2005: 1.6m.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date, comprising 15.2 m 2005: 6.7m assets included in trade and other receivables and 9.1m 2005: 5.1m liabilities included in trade and other payables.

Retirement benefit schemes Retirement benefit obligation comprises gross pension liability of 205.9m 2005: 219.8m and gross post-retirement health care liability of 2.7m 2005: 2.7m.
The Group operates Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution pension schemes.
In the UK, the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund TWGP&LAF and the Taylor Woodrow NHS Pension Scheme TWNHSPS are funded Defined Benefit schemes.
The TWGP&LAF merged with the Bryant Group Pension Scheme BGPS on 24 June 2002 and with the Wilson Connolly Holdings Pension Scheme WCHPS, the Wainhomes Ltd Pension Scheme WHLPS and the Prestoplan Pension Scheme PPS on 27 August 2004.
The schemes are managed by trustees.
All scheme assets are held separately from the Group.
With the exception of the TWNHSPS the Defined Benefit schemes are closed to new entrants and with effect from 30 November 2006 to future pension accrual.
An alternative Defined Contribution arrangement, the Taylor Woodrow Personal Choice Plan, is offered to new employees and from 1 December 2006 to employees who previously accrued benefits in the TWGP&LAF.
Contributions of 6.7m 2005: 5.9m were charged to income in respect of defined contribution schemes.
The Group also operates a number of overseas pension schemes of the defined benefit and defined contribution type.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the TWGP & LAF was carried out at 1 June 2004 and updated to 1 September 2004 to take account of subsequent mergers.
The TWNHSPS commenced in December 2003 and the Actuary has completed his initial valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2003.
The projected unit method was used in all valuations and assets were taken into account using market values.
The next formal valuations of the TWGP&LAF and TWNHSPS are due to take place on 1 June 2007 and 31 December 2006 respectively.
As part of the discussions with the Trustees of the TWGP&LAF around the closure of the scheme to future accrual, the Group has agreed to increase deficit repair payments from the current level of 4.8m pa to 20m pa for the next 10 years.
These payments will be reviewed at each valuation.

Retirement benefit schemes continued The main financial assumptions, which were used for the triennial funding valuation and are all relative to the inflation assumption, are as set out below: Assumptions TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS Inflation 2.5% pa 2.5% pa Investment return pre post retirement 5.0 3.0% pa 3.0 3.0% pa General pay inflation 0% pa 1.0% pa Pension increases 0% pa 0% pa Valuation results TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS Market value of assets 563.3m 0.05m Past service liabilities 627.9m 0.09m Scheme funding levels 90% 58% The actuaries to each scheme calculated the long-term funding rates to be 16.0 per cent TWGP&LAF and 18 per cent TWNHSPS of each schemes respective pensionable salary roll.
The funding policy of the Trustees is to maintain a stable contribution rate with a funding level in excess of 100 per cent.
The valuations of the Groups pension schemes have been updated to 31 December 2006 and the position of overseas schemes has been included within the IAS 19 disclosures.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items are as follows: United Kingdom North America 2006 2005 2006 2005 As at 31 December Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.10% 4.75% 5.0-5.7% 5.0-5.4% Expected return on scheme assets 5.87% 5.8% 5.5-6.6% 6.6% Deferred pension increases 3.00% 2.75% 2.5-3.5% 2.5-3.5% Pension increases 2.75% 2.6% 3.5-4.0% 0.0-3.0% The basis for the above assumptions are prescribed by IAS 19 and do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the Groups pension schemes.
The key change in assumptions in the year relates to future bond yields.
In addition, the company has strengthened its assumptions in respect of underlying mortality by adoption of the 92 series tables, which for a 65 year-old male, the life expectancy assumed has increased from 16.9 years to 19 years.
The fair value of assets and present value of obligations of the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements, are set out below: Expected rate of United North Total Percentage return Kingdom America plans of total plan % pa m m m assets held 31 December 2006 Assets: Equities 7.97% 346.9 7.5 354.4 47% Bonds Gilts 5.12% 4.47% 376.4 4.0 380.3 51% Other assets 5.12% 14.7 0.2 15.0 2% 738.0 11.7 749.7 100% Present value of defined benefit obligations 944.4 11.2 955.6 Surplus deficit in schemes recognised as non-current liability 206.4 0.5 205.9 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 69 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2006 20.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

The gross post-retirement liability also includes 2.7m at 31 December 2006 2005: 2.7m in respect of continuing post-retirement health care insurance premiums for retired long-service employees.
The liability is based upon the actuarial assessment of the remaining cost by a qualified actuary on a net present value basis at 31 December 2006.
The cost is calculated assuming a discount rate of 5 per cent per annum and an increase in medical expenses of 11.9 per cent per annum.
The premium cost to the Group in respect of retired long-service employees for 2006 was 0.2m 2005: 0.2m.

As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the companys share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, in this share-based payment tax reserve.

Contingent liabilities Florida Litigation On 20 November 2006, a jury trial in Florida awarded damages against several US-based Taylor Woodrow subsidiaries totalling US$44.4m, or 22.7m at 31 December 2006 exchange rates.
This award included US$20m of punitive damages.
Some elements of this award were issued on a joint or joint and several liability basis with unrelated third parties.
The jury verdict does not become a final judgment until post-trial motions, filed by Taylor Woodrow and other parties to the litigation, have been heard and ruled upon by the judge.
This case arose from The Beach Residences project in Sarasota, Florida, which contributed to profits in 2005 and 2006.
External legal opinion is that this award should be reduced by $14.6m as several of the awards were duplicative in nature, when the original jury decision is confirmed in 2007, notwithstanding any reduction due to post-trial motions.
The reduction due to the duplicative awards leaves a resulting US$29.8 million, which represents 15.2 million at 31 December 2006 exchange rates as the external legal interpretation of the original jury award.
In addition, Taylor Woodrow has an indemnity, from one of the co-defendants, which should give a level of reimbursement of some of the US$29.8m referred to above.
The directors continue to be confident that the judge, a post-trial motion or subsequent appeal will materially reduce the original jury award.
On some aspects of the case however, the directors have been able to make a reliable estimate of the likely outcome and a suitable provision has been made.
Due to commercial considerations, that could prejudice Taylor Woodrow, the amount provided is not disclosed.
However for the majority of the awards under the case, due to the fundamental uncertainties around the possible outcome of the trial, no reliable estimate can be made to record a provision in the 2006 accounts for this preliminary jury award and accordingly no provision has been recorded.
General The company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counterindemnities in respect of bonds relating to the Groups own contracts and given guarantees in respect of the Groups share of certain contractual obligations of joint ventures.
Provision is made for the directors best estimate of all known legal claims and all legal actions in progress.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
Operating lease arrangements The Group as lessee At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2006 2005 m m Within one year 14.6 14.0 In more than one year but not more than five years 41.1 32.9 After five years 30.7 31.9 86.4 78.8 76 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2006 32.
Operating lease arrangements continued Operating lease payments principally represent rentals payable by the Group for certain office properties and vehicles.
The Group as lessor At the balance sheet date, the Group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments: 2006 2005 m m Within one year 1.5 0.8 In more than one year but not more than five years 5.5 3.0 After five years 5.2 2.3 12.2 6.1 Operating lease receipts represent rental income in respect of certain office and commercial properties.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had a range of exercise prices from nil to 2.79 2005: nil to 2.61 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.6 years 2005: 4.9 years.
For share options with non-market conditions granted during the current and preceding year the fair value of those options at grant date were determined using the Binomial model.
The inputs into that model were as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price 3.74 3.11 Weighted average exercise price 1.02 0.68 Expected volatility 27.0%-29.3% 32.4%-32.9% Expected life 3 5 years 3 5 years Risk-free rate 4.5%-4.8% 4.33%-4.36% Expected dividend yield 4.1% 3.6%-3.8% The weighed average fair value of share options granted during the year is 2.56 2005: 2.29.
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 77 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2006 33.
Share-based payments continued For shares options with market conditions granted during the current year, the fair value of these options were determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The inputs into that model were as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price 3.82 3.19 Weighted average exercise price nil nil Expected volatility 27% 26%-30% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk-free rate 4.5% 4.2% Expected dividend yield 4.1% 3.6% The weighed average fair value of share options granted during the year is 1.01 2005: 1.75.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the expected term.
The expected life used in the model is based on historic exercise patterns.
The Group recognised total expenses of 6.1m and 5.9m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2006 and 2005 respectively.
Related party transactions Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are disclosed below.
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures are disclosed in the companys separate financial statements.
Trading transactions During the year, Group companies purchases from joint ventures totalled 30.7m 2005: 7.3m.
Purchases were based on open market values.
Remuneration of key management personnel Details of the remuneration of the directors and members of the Executive Committee, who are the key management personnel of the Group, are contained in the audited part of the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 45 and form part of these financial statements.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 7 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on financial instruments when the relevant standard comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
