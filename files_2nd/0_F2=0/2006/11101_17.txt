The recoverable amount of goodwill at 28 January 2006 was measured on the basis of value in use.
As this exceeded carrying value, no impairment loss was recognised.
The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT Sourcing to efficiently meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 5.25%.

Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a pension scheme in the UK which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is a funded arrangement which provides benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries, overtime and annual performance bonuses and was closed to new members in September 2000.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined after September 2000 and benefits are based on each individual members personal account.
The scheme has equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex.

The Group also provides further, unfunded retirement benefits to scheme members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by a statutory salary cap.
The components of the net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement are as follows: 2006 2005 Funded Unfunded Total Funded Unfunded Total m m m m m m Current service cost 14.5 0.7 15.2 11.7 0.2 11.9 Interest cost on benefit obligation 16.6 0.4 17.0 15.4 0.3 15.7 Expected return on plan assets 16.0 16.0 13.9 13.9 Net benefit expense recognised in administration expenses 15.1 1.1 16.2 13.2 0.5 13.7 Actual return on plan assets 53.6 53.6 18.7 18.7 51 Notes to the Financial Statements 23.
