132 K A Z AK HM YS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2 0 0 6 mining Re seRv e s An d Re souRCe s ReseRves and ResouRCes estimation methods The Republic of Kazakhstan has incorporated by law the classification system and estimation methods for reserves and resources established by the Former Soviet Union FSU and later revised in 1981.
In practice, this means that the statements of reserves and resources developed by Kazakhmys LLC, and the mining plans to which they relate, must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources for which adherence to the standardised national system of reserves and resources estimation is mandatory.
As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of Conditions for Estimation of Reserves were prepared by the corresponding National Design Institute and were approved within the national formerly USSR State Plan.
The Conditions apply a well-defined process of classifying the specific deposit into one of five major deposit categories, subject to which the principles for exploration and classification of reserves and resources have been established.
The Conditions for Estimation of Reserves for each deposit specify the method of computation of reserve blocks, the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations which may apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present difficulties.
Reserves and resources have been estimated by Kazakhmys LLC according to the FSU Classification and Estimation Methods for Reserves and Resources.
IMC has reviewed the reserves and resources statements of Kazakhmys LLC and has restated the reserves and resources in accordance with JORC.
A copy of IMCs report addressed to the Directors relating to the scope and result of their review can be found on page 144.
All reserves quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution.
Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution and are inclusive of reserves.
All figures in reserves and resources are in metric tonnes and are dated 31 December 2006.

No ore loss or dilution has been included.

142 K A Z AK HM YS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2 0 0 6 mining Re seRv e s An d Re souRCe s continued Changes in the ReseRves and ResouRCes Base duRing 2006 The total measured and indicated resources of Kazakhmys LLC have decreased slightly during 2006 to a total of 2,907 MT, as compared to 2,957 MT at 31 December 2005.
Reasons for the changes by complex are shown on page 143.
The reduction in total reserves by approximately 44 MT primarily reflects changes in mine plans due to a revised treatment of those reserves categorised as inactive and the redefinition of the Modifying Factors.
This total comprises a reduction at Annensky and East mines of approximately 10.8 MT and 14.1 MT respectively due to the above two factors and the exclusion of pillar areas deemed unstable.
The sum reduction of 17.7 MT at South mine is as a result of the preceding reasons and also the exclusion of inactive reserves.
There has been some redistribution of reserves for operational reasons to maximise the efficient use of existing infrastructure.
The most significant transfer has been of 11.8 MT from Stepnoy mine to South mine due to the exclusion of inactive reserves at South mine.
Reserve transfers from Stepnoy mine to other mines total 12.5 MT and are balanced by an upgrade of 13.0 MT to reserves from resources at Stepnoy.
The push back waste stripping at the North mine open pits has upgraded an additional 6.5 MT of reserves from resources.
Balkhash Complex Kazakhmys LLC has completed a reorganisation and Nurkazgan mine now falls under the Karaganda region.
The total of proved and probable reserves has decreased by 6.6 MT more than the depletion due to extraction in the 12 month period.
This is due to the change in perspective in the Modifying Factors with a loss of reserves of 4.9 MT at Kounrad partially balanced by small gains at the Shatyrkul and Sayak mines.
Reserves at the Aktogay project have not undergone alteration.
east Region Abyz and Kosmurun mines report to the Karaganda Region after the reorganisation within Kazakhmys LLC.
The decrease in proven and probable reserves is greater than the depletion due to extraction in the 12 month period.
The reduction in total reserves by approximately 22.6 MT primarily reflects a reduction of 18.9 MT at Artemyevskoe mine due to previously identified reserves now deemed outside the mining project.
A pit wall failure has sterilised some reserves at Nikolaevskoe.
The remaining losses at Nikolaevskoe, Belousovskoe and Orlovskoe due to the changes in perspective of the Modifying Factors have been offset by the definition of additional reserves at  and to positive changes resulting from the Modifying Factors at Irtyshskoe and .
kaRaganda Region This region comprises the Abyz mine currently undergoing a waste push back prior to recommencing ore production in 2008 and the Kosmurun and Nurkazgan mines.
There has been an appreciable increase in resources and hence reserves due to incorporation of resources translating to approximately an additional 49.0 MT at Nurkazgan.
The redefinition of the resource base has resulted in an additional 0.9 MT of reserves at Kosmurun mine.
Both increases are inclusive of the adjustment for the revised modifying factors.
Coal ReseRves The decrease in proven and probable coal reserves approximates the depletion due to extraction in the 12 month period.
