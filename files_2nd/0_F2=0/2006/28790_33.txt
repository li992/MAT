Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are its investment portfolio, bank balances and cash and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to its financial assets.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk and its exposure is spread over a number of counterparties.
