91 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation and change in accounting policy The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The Directors Report, Corporate Governance and Directors Remuneration Report disclosures have been made in the front section of this report, refer to pages 29 to 43.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, except as noted below.
Change in accounting policy The company has made a prior year adjustment arising from a change in accounting policy in respect of the capitalisation of brand costs.
Intangible assets at 1 January 2005 have been reduced by 0.2 million.
There is no impact on the company profit in either the current year or the prior year.
Cash flow statement The company has utilised the exemptions provided under FRS1 Revised and has not presented a cash flow statement.
The cash flow statement has been prepared in the Group financial statements.
Related party transaction In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard Number 8: Related Party Disclosures, the company is exempt from disclosing transactions with entities that are part of the Aegis Group, or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties, as it is a parent publishing consolidated financial statements.
Employee benefits The retirement benefits for employees are principally provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from the Company and employees.
The amount charged to the income statement is the contribution payable in the year.
Share based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
Certain employees receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, including shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the instruments concerned at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the vesting date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors at that date, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all fixed assets to their residual value over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets at the following rates: Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10% - 20% per annum or over the lease if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment and vehicles 10% - 50% per annum Software 33% per annum Other 5% -10% per annum Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held in the Company balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
92 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 Finance costs Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Profit and Loss account at a constant rate over the life of the debt.
Financial instruments Financial assets are accounted for on the trade date.
Financial assets and financial liabilities principally include the following: Trade debtors Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs and at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to the income statement as incurred using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible bond The convertible bond is regarded as a hybrid financial instrument, consisting of a liability component being the host contract, and an equity conversion component also recognised as a liability.
The instrument is treated wholly as a liability as the convertible bond is denominated in a foreign currency and therefore the proceeds upon conversion are considered to be a variable amount of functional currency cash for a fixed number of shares.
At the date of issue, the embedded option to convert the host contract into equity of the Company is separately fair valued.
The amount assigned to host contract liability is the net proceeds after issue costs less the fair value of the embedded option.
The difference between the fair value of the host contract liability at issue and its face value is being amortised over the life of the instrument as a notional interest charge through the income statement.
The Company's convertible bond matured in May 2006.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
The Companys activities expose it to certain financial risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Liabilities in respect of option agreements Option agreements that allow the Companys equity partners to require the Company to purchase the minority interest are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair values of such options are re-measured at each period end.
The movement in the fair value is recognised as income or expense within finance charges in the income statement.
The Company recognises its best estimate of the amount it is likely to pay, should these options be exercised by the minority interests, as a liability in the balance sheet.

Financial instruments The Company has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Company, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Company does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Companys policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
Management of financial risk The Company considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Companys policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk The Company monitors transactional currency exposures and sources hedging opportunities to reduce foreign exchange risk using approved markets and instruments.
Liquidity risk The Companys objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Companys principal debt instruments are subject to certain financial covenants.
At 31 December 2006, the Company had net debt before issue costs of new debt of 535.5 million 2005: 505.9 million.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 11.2 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 1.9 million and gross borrowings of 546.7 million 2005: 507.8 million.
Included within gross borrowings is nil 2005: 121.5million of 2 per cent convertible bonds due in 2006.
These bonds were issued on 15 May 2002.
Also included within gross borrowings is 67.1 million US$131.5 million 2005: 92.9 million US$160 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000 which are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008, and 174.6 million US$342 million 2005: 198.5 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 28 July 2005 which are repayable in full between 2012 and 2017.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2006, the Company has undrawn committed facilities of 265.4 million 2005: 294.9 million.
Interest rate risk The Companys convertible bond and the unsecured loan notes, referred to above, are at fixed rates.
All other borrowings are at floating rates.
The Company has in place cash pooling arrangements in the United Kingdom.
These enable the Company to minimise the interest paid on shortterm borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
Credit Risk The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Convertible bond On 15 May 2002, the Company issued165 million of convertible bonds, due in 2006.
The bonds were redeemed on 15 May 2006 at 107.95% of their principal amount.
Interest was payable on the bonds at 2 per cent per annum with a 1.875 per cent premium payable.
96 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 9.
Financial instruments continued Convertible bond continued The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bond were split between the host contract liability element and an equity conversion component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company.
The equity conversion component was separately included within liabilities.
This component was then marked to market at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the host contract liability component was valued at 91.1 million, excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was 11.9 million.
At 31 December 2005, the host contract liability component was 121.5 million excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was nil.
Issue costs are deducted from the amount of funds received and amortised over the term of the debt.
Private Placement Debt November 2000 On 20 November 2000, the Company issued US$160 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2006 and 2008.
These loan notes were guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
US$28.5 million was settled during the year.
On 28 July 2005, the Company issued US$342 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2012 and 2017.
On 9 November 2005 cross currency swaps were entered into for US$142m of the loan notes due in 2012 and US$50m of the loan notes due in 2015 to convert this US$ fixed rate borrowing into EUR fixed rate borrowing.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
Cross currency swaps The fair value of the cross currency swaps entered into at 31 December 2006 is 9.3 million 2005: 1.6 million.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Euro US$ foreign exchange spot rate and in Euro and US$ interest rate yields.
The cross currency swaps are synthetically split to reflect the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The US$ Sterling leg of the swaps act as cash flow hedges against the Groups US$ loan notes and the Euro Sterling leg of the swaps act as net investment hedges in respect of certain of the Groups Euro-denominated investments.

Share-based payments The Company recognised a total expense of 0.7 million 2005: 0.8 million in respect of all share-based payments in the year.
Share-based payments include share options and conditional share awards.
Share options The Company issues share options to certain employees.
The grant price for share options is equal to the average quoted market price of the Company shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is typically three years.
If share options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Company before the options vest and are subject to EPS performance conditions.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report.
Details of outstanding share options are provided in note 32 to the Groups financial statements.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 0.92.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of 1.07, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.4 years 2005: 5.9 years.
The fair value per option granted weighted average in the year was 0.36 2005: 0.28.
The fair value of share options was determined using a stochastic model using the assumptions given in the table below.
2006 2005 Expected volatility 23.0% 25.0% Risk free rate 4.4% 4.7% Expected dividend yield 1.2% 1.4% Expected volatility was determined by considering the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous three years, with certain periods where the share price was particularly volatile for specific reasons, being disregarded as these were not considered to be indicative of expected future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Company recognised a total expense of 0.3 million 2005: 0.5 million in respect of share options in the year.
Conditional share awards The Company issues conditional share awards to certain employees.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The fair value of conditional share awards was determined using a stochastic model using the assumptions given in the table above.
