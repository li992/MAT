For both the Staff and Executive Schemes the actuarial table used is PA92 YOB MC 2.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate in the schemes were to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the schemes would change by approximately 1 million.
