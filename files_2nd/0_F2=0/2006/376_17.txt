49 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 1.
General Information Aegis Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 28.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Report of the Directors on pages 29 to 30.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below in Note 3.
The Group believes that underlying results note 5 and underlying earnings per share note 12 provide additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The term underlying is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit.
The principal adjustments made are in respect of items which are significant by nature or amount in the opinion of the directors.
These may include impairment charges and other adjusting items, including profits and losses on disposals of investments, amortisation of purchased intangible assets being amortisation charged on separately identifiable intangible assets in acquired businesses, unrealised gains and losses on non-hedge derivative financial instruments, fair value gains and losses on liabilities in respect of put option agreements, and any related tax thereon, as appropriate.
The Groups operations are split into two principal market sectors, namely media communications and market research.
These divisions are further analysed into geographic segments which bring together products in comparable market areas under common business heads.
This is how the Groups operational management is structured and its results are reviewed and thus form the primary reporting segments note 4.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim reporting and impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Accounting policies Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented in this Annual Report.
The Group has adopted the following amendments mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006: IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 - Amendment for financial guarantee contracts - which amended the scope of IAS 39 to include financial guarantee contracts issued.
The amendment addresses the treatment of financial guarantee contracts by the issuer.
Under IAS 39, as amended, financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially at fair value and generally re-measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue: IAS 39 - Amendment for hedges of forecast intra-group transactions - which amended IAS 39 to permit the foreign currency risk of a highly probable intra-group forecast transaction to qualify as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge, provided that the transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction and that the foreign currency risk will affect the financial statements: and IAS 39 - Amendment for the fair value option - which restricted the use of the option to designate any financial asset or any financial liability to be measured at fair value through profit and loss.
The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the financial results of the Group in either the current or prior periods.
50 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 3.
Accounting policies continued Change in accounting policy and balance sheet reclassifications The Group has made a prior year adjustment arising from a change in accounting policy in respect of the capitalisation of brand costs.
Intangible assets at 1 January 2005 have been reduced by 0.5 million.
There is no impact on Group profit in either the current year or the prior year.
During the year, the Group has reconsidered the classification of an investment fund and as a result has reclassified this investment from cash and cash equivalents to other financial assets.
The impact at 31 December 2005 was a reduction in cash and cash equivalents of 16.8m 1 January 2005: 17.0m.
The Group has also reclassified 1.4m from goodwill to intangible assets at 31 December 2005 in respect of intangible assets acquired on 2005 acquisitions.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cash flows and net assets of Aegis Group plc and the entities controlled by it after eliminating internal transactions and recognising any minority interests in those entities.
Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Where subsidiaries are acquired in the year, their results and cash flows are included from the date of acquisition up to the balance sheet date.
Where a consolidated company is less than 100% owned by the Group, the minority interest share of the results and net assets are recognised at each reporting date.
Where a company has net liabilities, no asset is recorded within minority interests unless the minority shareholder has an obligation to make good its share of the net liabilities.
A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given in the notes to the Companys separate financial statements.
The companies listed immediately below are included in the consolidated financial statements of Aegis Group plc, as such we apply S264b HGB of the German Commercial Code.
Aegis Media GmbH & Co. Central Services, Wiesbaden CARAT Wiesbaden GmbH & Co. KG Media-Service, Wiesbaden HMS GmbH & Co. KG Media-Service, Wiesbaden CARAT Hamburg GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg 21 TwentyOne GmbH & Co. KG Markenberatung, Frankfurt b Associates Associated companies are entities in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies it exercises a significant influence and which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
The reporting dates and accounting policies used by its associates are the same as those used by the Group.
The Groups associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement and as a movement in the Groups share of associates net assets in the balance sheet.
Its share of any post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised directly in equity.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
c Joint ventures Joint ventures are investments over which the Group exercises joint control with a third party.
Such investments are equity accounted for.
Business combinations and goodwill The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill recognised under UK GAAP prior to the date of transition to IFRS is stated at net book value as at that date.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 51 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 3.
Accounting policies continued Business combinations and goodwill continued impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions is provided based on the directors best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date.
The liability is discounted and an imputed interest charge is included in the income statement.
Changes to estimates of amounts payable are made to deferred consideration and goodwill.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Separately acquired intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
For business combinations, cost is calculated based on the Groups valuation methodology, using discounted cash flows.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where these criteria are met, the development expenditure is capitalised at cost.
Where they are not met development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets are amortised to residual values over the useful economic life of the asset as follows: Software 20% to 50% per annum Panel costs 33% per annum Patents and trademarks Nil to 20% per annum Other 10% to 50% per annum Where an assets useful life is considered indefinite, an annual impairment test is performed see below.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of these fixed assets to their residual value over their expected useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis: Freehold buildings 1% to 5% per annum Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10% to 20% per annum or over the period of the lease, if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment and vehicles 10% to 50% per annum The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
52 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 3.
Accounting policies continued Inventory: work in progress Work in progress comprises directly attributable costs on incomplete market research projects and is held in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, net of overdrafts.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where leasehold properties remain unutilised by the Group and have not been sublet, provision is made in full for the outstanding rental payments together with other outgoings for the remaining period of the lease.
This provision takes into account any future sublet income reasonably expected to be obtained.
Future rental payments are charged against this provision in the period in which they are made.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Investments in own shares, held through the Aegis Group Employee Share Trust, are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity at cost.
The costs of administration of the Trust are included in the income statement as they accrue.
Turnover amounts invoiced to clients and revenue Turnover amounts invoiced to clients represents amounts invoiced for media handled by the Group on behalf of clients, together with fees invoiced for media and research services provided, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is the value of media and research fees and commission earned by the Group.
Media revenue is recognised when charges are made to clients, principally when advertisements appear in the media.
Fees are recognised over the period of the relevant assignments or agreements.
Performance related income is recognised when it can be reliably estimated whether, and the extent to which, the performance criteria have been met.
For the market research business, revenue is recognised on the satisfactory completion of a specific phase of a project.
Provision is made for losses on a project when identified.
Invoices raised during the course of a project are booked as deferred income on the balance sheet until such a time as the related revenue is recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Share-based payment transactions The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that remained unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Certain employees receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, including shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the instruments concerned at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the vesting date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors at that date, will ultimately vest.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Employee benefits The retirement benefits for employees are principally provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
The amount charged to the income statement is the contribution payable in the year by Group companies.
In addition, the Group has a small number of funded defined benefit obligations, principally where required by local statutory regulations.
53 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 3.
Accounting policies continued Employee benefits continued The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit obligations is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost less the fair value of the plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds approximating to the terms of the related liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately outside the income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Upon settlement, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate ruling on the settlement date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are re-translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon retranslation at the settlement date or balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such nonmonetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of foreign currency borrowings used to provide a hedge against foreign currency investments, including goodwill, are taken directly to reserves.
For consolidation purposes, the trading results and cash flows in foreign currencies, arising in foreign operations, are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the period.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon consolidation are taken directly to reserves.
In the event of the disposal of an operation such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses.
Leased assets Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations from the transition date of 1 January 2004 in respect of intangible assets and properties.
A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, including interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
54 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 3.
Accounting policies continued Taxation continued Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Segment result is segment operating profit stated before share of results of associated undertakings and joint ventures.
Financial instruments Financial assets are accounted for on the trade date.
Financial assets and financial liabilities principally include the following: Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs and at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through profit or loss.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to the income statement as incurred using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible bond The convertible bond is regarded as a hybrid financial instrument, consisting of a liability component being the host contract, and an equity conversion component also recognised as a liability.
The instrument is treated wholly as a liability as the convertible bond is denominated in a foreign currency and therefore the proceeds upon conversion are considered to be a variable amount of functional currency cash for a fixed number of shares.
At the date of issue, the embedded option to convert the host contract into equity of the Group, is separately fair valued and thereafter measured at fair value in the income statement.
The amount assigned to host contract liability is the net proceeds after issue costs less the fair value of the embedded option.
The difference between the fair value of the host contract liability at issue and its face value is amortised over the life of the instrument as a notional interest charge through the income statement.
The Groups convertible bond matured in May 2006.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely-related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
55 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 3.
Accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Liabilities in respect of option agreements Option agreements that allow the Groups equity partners to require the Group to purchase the minority interest are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair values of such options are re-measured at each period end.
The movement in the fair value is recognised as income or expense within finance charges in the income statement.
The Group recognises its best estimate of the amount it is likely to pay, should these options be exercised by the minority interests, as a liability in the balance sheet.
Accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and judgement concerning the future and the resulting estimates may, by definition, vary from the related actual results.
The Directors considered the critical accounting estimates and judgements used in the Accounts and concluded that the main areas of judgement are: revenue recognition policies in respect of performance related income: contingent deferred payments in respect of acquisitions: recognition of share based payments: and valuation of intangible assets.
The estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances and are discussed, to the extent necessary, in more detail in their respective notes.

The tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2006 is 33.4 million 2005: 29.4 million representing an effective tax rate including deferred tax on goodwill on reported profits of 29.4% 2005: 31.3%.
The tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2006 includes a deferred tax liability of 1.5m 2005: nil for a tax deduction taken in respect of goodwill.
IFRS requires that such a deferred tax liability is recognised even if such a liability would only unwind on the eventual sale or impairment of the business in question.
UK Corporation tax is calculated at 30% 2005: 30% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: 2006 2005 m m Profit before taxation 113.5 94.0 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2005: 30% 34.1 28.2 Adjustments in respect of prior years 0.5 1.1 Tax effect of income that is not taxable for tax purposes 1.1 1.3 Rate differences on overseas earnings 2.4 5.3 Tax losses carried forward in the period: UK 0.6 4.2 Tax losses utilised in the period: overseas 2.0 2.0 Other reconciling items 1.1 3.9 Tax expense for the year 33.4 29.4 Effective rate 29.4% 31.3% The Groups profit before taxation all arises from continuing operations.
Therefore the Groups tax charge also relates solely to continuing operations.
IAS 1 requires income from associates to be presented net of tax on the face of the income statement.
The associates tax is no longer included within the Groups total tax charge.
Associates tax included within Net income from associates for the year ended 31 December 2006 is 0.2 million 2005: 0.1 million.

Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash generating units which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
This allocation largely represents the Groups primary and secondary reporting segments as set out below.
Any goodwill associated with the individual cash generating units subsumed within these reporting segments is not individually significant when compared to the goodwill of the Group.

Goodwill continued An impairment of 1.4 million was charged in respect of one of the Groups companies in India following the deterioration in the performance of this business.
The allocation of goodwill presented above is net of this impairment charge.
An impairment of 3.9m has been booked in respect of one of the Groups associates in India.
The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on estimated growth rates of between 3% and 21%.
After this time, cash flows are extrapolated based on the estimated long-term growth in gross domestic product of 2.5%.
Cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.75%.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time.
They are significantly affected by a number of factors such as market growth, discount rates, currency exchange rates and future capital expenditure.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.

The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives is 3.2 million 2005: 3.4 million, principally relating to trade names.
These are considered to have indefinite lives because it is the Groups intention to continue to invest in these assets and by doing so, their value will be protected and indeed enhanced.
This continued investment will involve significant expenditure on training, recruitment, technological development and legal protection.

Financial instruments The Group has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Group, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Groups policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
Management of financial risk The Group considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Groups policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk A significant portion of the Groups activities takes place overseas.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures on transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and upon consolidation following the translation of the local currency results and net assets liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups foreign currency management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge all transactions and financial instruments with material currency exposures.
The Group is a party to a number of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
These are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The total notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are shown below.
2006 2005 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 26.2 21.2 The fair values of currency derivatives included in the balance sheet are based on market values supplied by the banks through which the currency derivatives were acquired.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are taken to the income statement.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from the translation of profits or net assets as these represent an accounting rather than cash exposure.
The Groups policy is to borrow locally wherever possible to act as a natural hedge against the translation risk arising from its net investments overseas.
A currency analysis of borrowings is given below.
It is estimated that a strengthening of Sterling by 1% would reduce 2006 profit before tax by 1.2 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Group also seeks to manage its working capital requirement by requiring clients to pay for media in advance whenever possible.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had net debt before issue costs of new debt of 228.6 million 2005: 209.5 million restated.
The Group had cash and cash equivalents of 262.5 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 263.9 million restated and gross borrowings of 493.1 million 2005: 475.6 million.
The Groups principal debt instruments are subject to certain financial covenants.
Included within gross borrowings is nil 2005: 121.5 million of 2 per cent convertible bonds due in 2006.
These bonds were issued on 15 May 2002.
Also included within gross borrowings is 67.1 million US$131.5 million 2005: 92.9 million US$160 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000, which are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008, and 174.6 million US$342 million 2005: 198.5 million US$342 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 28 July 2005, which are repayable in full between 2012 and 2017.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2006, the Group has undrawn committed facilities of 265.4 million 2005: 294.9 million.
Interest rate risk The Groups convertible bond and the unsecured loan notes, referred to above, are at fixed rates.
All other borrowings are at floating rates.
The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to US$160 million of unsecured loan notes Private Placement Debt November 2000 from fixed into floating rates.
The Group has in place cash pooling arrangements in a number of territories.
These enable the Group to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
71 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 20.
Financial instruments continued Credit Risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash balances.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet in respect of trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade credit risk is managed in each territory through the use of credit checks on new clients and individual credit limits, where considered necessary.
In some instances clients are required to pay for media in advance.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Short-term debtors and creditors and currency disclosures Short-term debtors and trade creditors have been excluded from all disclosures provided in this note.
Group companies do not have material, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currencies.
Hence, no currency risk disclosures have been provided.
Convertible bond On 15 May 2002, the Group issued165 million of convertible bonds, due in 2006.
The bonds were redeemed on 15 May 2006 at 107.95% of their principal amount.
Interest was payable on the bonds at 2 per cent per annum with a 1.875 per cent premium payable.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bond were split between the host contract liability element and an equity conversion component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group.
The equity conversion component was separately included within liabilities.
This component is then marked to market at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the host contract liability component was valued at 91.1 million, excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was 11.9 million.
At 31 December 2005, the host contract liability component was 121.5 million, excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was nil.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of the convertible bond were until redemption taken directly to reserves as the convertible bond was used to provide a hedge against Euro-denominated investments.
Issue costs were deducted from the amount of funds received and amortised over the term of the debt.
Private Placement Debt November 2000 On 20 November 2000, the Group issued US$160 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2006 and 2008.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
Interest rate swaps have been entered into for the duration of the loan notes to convert this fixed rate borrowing into floating rate based upon the US six-month LIBOR rate.
These interest rate swaps are designated as hedging instruments of interest rate risk in respect of this debt.
When the hedge relationship is effective, the carrying value of this debt is adjusted by the changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk at the balance sheet date.
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in respect of the above borrowings being at floating rates.
US$28.5 million was settled during the year.
Interest rate swaps The fair value of the interest rate swaps entered into at 31 December 2006 and included in the balance sheet is 0.9 million 2005: 3.1million.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents unrecognised profits which the Group expects to realise as a result of lower variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan notes.
0.8 million of this is expected to be realised in 2007.
The interest rate swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the debt caused by changes in interest rates.
Movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are taken to the income statement where they offset against very similar but opposite movements in the fair value of the debt caused by movements in interest rates.
Private Placement Debt July 2005 On 28 July 2005, the Group issued US$342 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2012 and 2017.
On 9 November 2005 cross currency swaps were entered into for US$142 million of the loan notes due in 2012 and US$50 million of the loan notes due in 2015 to convert this US$ fixed rate borrowing into EUR fixed rate borrowing.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and are used to provide a hedge against US dollar-denominated investments.
To the extent that this hedging relationship is effective, exchange differences arising on the re-translation of the US$150 million of debt not impacted by the cross currency swaps are taken directly to reserves.
72 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 20.
Financial instruments continued Cross currency swaps The fair value of the cross currency swaps entered into at 31 December 2006 is 9.3 million 2005: 1.6m.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Euro US$ foreign exchange spot rate and in Euro and US$ interest rate yields.
The cross currency swaps are synthetically split, for accounting purposes, to reflect the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The US$ Sterling leg of the swaps act as cash flow hedges against the Groups US$ loan notes and the Euro Sterling leg of the swaps act as net investment hedges in respect of certain of the Groups Euro-denominated investments.

The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to the US$131.5 million 2005: US$160 million unsecured loan notes from fixed into floating rates.
At 31 December 2006, it is estimated that a general simultaneous parallel shift of 1% in interest rates would increase the Groups reported profit by approximately 2.0 million.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of earnings in overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 318.4 million 2005: 223.3m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Group is taking steps to seek recompense and, although it is probable there will be some recovery of funds, the amount is not sufficiently certain to be recognised as an asset.

Share-based payments The Group recognised a total expense of 6.9 million 2005: 4.5 million in respect of all share-based payments in the year.
Share-based payments include share options and conditional share awards.
Share options The Group issues share options to certain employees.
The grant price for share options is equal to the average quoted market price of the Company shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is typically three years.
If share options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest and are subject to EPS performance conditions.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of 1.07 2005: 1.04, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.4 years 2005: 5.9 years.
The fair value per option granted weighted average in the year was 0.36 2005: 0.28.
The fair value of share options was determined using a stochastic model and the following assumptions: 2006 2005 Expected volatility 23.0% 25.0% Risk free rate 4.4% 4.7% Expected dividend yield 1.2% 1.4% Expected volatility was determined by considering the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years, with certain periods where the share price was particularly volatile for specific reasons, being disregarded as these were not considered to be indicative of expected future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a total expense of 2.1 million 2005: 2.3 million in respect of share options in the year.
Conditional share awards The Group issues conditional share awards to certain employees.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The fair value of conditional share awards was determined using a stochastic model using the assumptions given in the table above.
The Group recognised a total expense of 4.8 million 2005: 2.2 million in respect of conditional share awards in the year.
