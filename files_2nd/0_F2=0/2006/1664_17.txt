Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 1 Revenue The activity of the Group is the supply of vehicle rental services and revenue is derived entirely from continuing activities.
The Group experiences a natural increase in demand from leisure customers over the European summer holiday months.
This seasonality generally results in lower revenue earned in the first half as compared to the second half of each year, together with an increase in the number of vehicles acquired in the period leading up to the summer months.
2 Business and geographical segments The dominant source and nature of the Groups risks and returns govern whether its primary segment reporting is by business segment or geographical segment.
The Group is subject to significant variations in risks and rewards between undertaking its operations through corporately owned businesses, as compared with the licensing of such operations to third parties.
Given the nature of the separate brands, the Group is also subject to significant variations in risks and rewards between its Avis branded businesses and its Budget branded businesses.
These variations contrast with more limited differentials between the risk and reward prole of operations in different geographical locations.
The Groups primary reporting format is therefore by business segment, and the secondary reporting format is geographical.
Segment assets include software, vehicles, other property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables and operating cash, goodwill, corporation tax, deferred tax and investments.
Segment liabilities include operating liabilities, taxation and certain corporate borrowings.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to software, vehicles excluding vehicles under manufacturer repurchase arrangements, other property, plant and equipment, including additions arising from business combinations, excluding goodwill arising on these acquisitions.

Unallocated operating profit primarily comprises head ofce expenses.
No adjustment is made between segments to recharge the value of the overall Avis Budget goodwill, brand or licence rights.
Avis goodwill of 1,080.4 million arising before 1 March 1998 was fully written off to reserves, and Budget goodwill of 33.9 million arising on 12 March 2003 has been fully impaired and charged to the income statement in previous periods.
Had the value of goodwill, brand or licence rights been charged to the segments, the individual segment results would be materially affected.
No adjustment is made between segments to allocate the value of goodwill written off to reserves in previous periods.

These restructuring costs include redundancy costs and onerous lease provisions and are net of exceptional pension curtailments of 1.2 million 2005: nil.
Restructuring costs of 2.0 million in 2005 were also incurred in connection with the transfer of back-ofce functions to the Groups shared service centre in Budapest.
b Following the Groups decision in 2004 to terminate the agreement with the principal contractor on the IT back-ofce project, additional termination costs of 7.4 million 2005: 3.6 million have been recognised in 2006, primarily arising from the mitigating action being taken against the termination costs, which may lead to a net credit in future accounting periods.
c In June 2006, significant changes were made to the unfunded pension scheme in Germany resulting in an exceptional credit to past service costs of 3.2 million 2005: nil.
d During the current and prior year, the collection of credit hire receivable balances in the closed Centrus business was more successful than previously anticipated and resulted in an exceptional credit of 0.6 million 2005: 3.2 million, reecting a partial reversal of the receivable write-offs and adjustment of reorganisation provisions made in previous years.
e In 2005, various professional, legal and consultancy costs were incurred in conjunction with the Companys capital restructuring and the rights issue.
Where such costs were not directly attributable to the issue of new shares, or the drawing down of new debt facilities, they were recognised in the income statement as exceptional items.

Options have been granted to certain Directors and employees over ordinary shares of the Company.
These options constitute the only category of potentially dilutive ordinary shares and these did not increase the weighted average number of shares in either 2005 or 2006.
These options were not dilutive as either the option exercise prices were in excess of the prevailing market share price, or the exercise of the options is subject to performance conditions which had not been fully satisfied by the year end.

In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, the Group completed a review of the carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006.
Goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing, each of these representing the Groups investment in each country where the goodwill originally arose.
The impairment review was to ensure that the carrying values of the assets within cash-generating units for which goodwill has been allocated are stated at no more than their recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Accumulated impairment provisions represent amounts provided in respect of Budget licensee locations in France, and certain Avis licensee locations in France, Germany and Holland.
Of these provisions, 0.3 million was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2006 following the acquisition during the year of several Avis licensee locations in Germany see Note 36 which have been integrated into existing operations.
Given that goodwill arising in the overall German cash-generating unit had been fully provided against in previous accounting periods, an impairment provision has been recognised against the goodwill arising in 2006.
All impairment provisions write down the carrying value of their associated goodwill to nil.
The Directors also reviewed at each year end the carrying values of the remaining capitalised goodwill relating to the business in Greece and the joint venture in China.
These reviews undertaken by calculating value in use did not result in the need for any impairment provision to be recognised as at 31 December 2005 or 31 December 2006.
In determining the value in use, the Directors calculated the present value of the estimated future cash ows expected to arise from the continuing use of the assets using pre-tax discount rates based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustment for the relevant risks associated with the businesses.
Estimated future cash ows are based on managements five-year plans for each cash-generating unit, with extrapolation thereafter based on long-term average nominal growth rates of 4.0%.
Sensitivities have been applied to the calculations by using pre-tax discount rates in the range from 7% to 10%.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
At the year end, the Group had unused tax losses of 144.7 million 2005: 123.4 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 36.9 million 2005: 43.8 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining unused tax losses of 107.8 million 2005: 79.6 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams, but these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of other temporary differences which would give rise to deferred tax assets of 8.2 million 2005: 6.5 million, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax liabilities of 0.3 million 2005: 0.1 million have similarly not been recognised.
At the year end, the aggregate amount of other temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of the Groups overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 264.9 million 2005: 212.9 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in the joint venture and associate are insignicant.

Vehicle related receivables include 167.9 million 2005: 163.3 million held under finance lease arrangements in respect of repurchase agreements.
The Groups principal financial assets comprise available for sale and held for trading investments: derivative financial instrument assets: trade and other receivables: and cash and short-term deposits, which in aggregate represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at each year end.
The credit risk on cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
With respect to vehicle related receivables, credit risk is concentrated with the main European vehicle manufacturers.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to non-vehicle related receivables are limited due to the diversity of the Groups customers.
Balance sheet amounts are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts, and accordingly, the maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying amount of the receivables in the balance sheet.
An allowance of 26.0 million 2005: 25.1 million has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts of trade and other receivables.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past experience.
Irrecoverable trade and other receivable expense of 5.4 million 2005: 4.6 million has been recognised in the income statement in the year.

Due to the timescales and uncertainties involved in such claims, provision is made based upon the prole of claims experience, allowing for potential claims for a number of years after policy inception.
Other trading provisions have been discounted where applicable at the rate commensurate with the underlying risk, and comprise: a reorganisation and employee termination provisions of 2.8 million 2005: 3.1 million that are expected to crystallise within the next few years.
The decrease in the provision in the year is primarily due to the partial utilisation of the restructuring provision established in previous periods see Note 5 : b dilapidation and environmental provisions of 8.9 million 2005: 6.6 million to cover the costs of the remediation of certain properties held under operating leases.
The fair value of these provisions, which are primarily euro denominated and non-interest bearing, are not materially different to the book values, and the ultimate expenditure is expected to be coterminous with the underlying remaining lease periods see Note 39.
Where applicable, the provisions have been discounted at rates between 5.2% and 10.0%: and c other short-term provisions of 7.7 million 2005: 5.5 million, which primarily comprise provision against the future redemption of benets under customer loyalty programmes and provision against legal claims that arise in the normal course of business, that are expected to crystallise in the next couple of years.
In the Directors opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of these legal claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond amounts provided at 31 December 2006.
Avis Europe plc 65 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 23 Retirement benefit obligations a Retirement benefit schemes operated Where applicable, subsidiaries contribute to the relevant state pension scheme.
Certain subsidiaries operate schemes which provide retirement benets, including those of the dened benefit type, which are in most cases funded by investments held outside the Group.
b Dened benefit schemes The Group operates funded dened benefit pension schemes for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Austria.
In addition, the Group operates unfunded dened benefit pension schemes for employees in Germany and Greece, and an unfunded dened benefit statutory termination scheme for employees in Italy.
The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and Germany.
The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations available, updated by the scheme actuaries to assess the liabilities of the scheme and the market value of the scheme assets at each of the balance sheet dates.

The expected return on bonds is based on long-term bond yields.
The expected return on equities is based on a wide range of qualitative and quantitative market analysis including consideration of market equity risk premiums.
Mortality assumptions vary by scheme.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from published statistics and experience in each territory.
The longevity assumption in the principal funded scheme applied a post-retirement life expectancy for a member aged 65 in 2006 of 21 years 2005: 18 years for males, and 23 years 2005: 21 years for females.
In the prior year, mortality tables issued in 1998 the 1992 series were used with adjustment to take account of projected improvements in longevity.
In 2006, the 2000 series tables were applied along with certain improvements which make allowance for increases in longevity projections through 2020.
The post-retirement longevity assumption in the principal unfunded scheme applied a life expectancy for a member aged 65 in 2006 of 18 years 2005: 18 years for males, and 22 years 2005: 22 years for females.

Avis Europe plc 70 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 26 Derivative financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups financial risk management objective is to reduce the financial risks and exposures facing the business with respect to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, and to ensure constant access to sufficient liquidity.
To achieve this the Group undertakes an active hedging policy, including the use of derivatives interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, options, forward rate agreements and caps and collars, which are entered into under policies approved and monitored by a sub-committee of the Board, chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These transactions are only undertaken to reduce exposures arising from underlying commercial transactions and at no time are transactions undertaken for speculative reasons.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups business is transacted in euros, sterling and US dollars.
The principal commercial currency of the Group is the euro.
The Group seeks to manage currency exposure wherever possible.
In each country where the Group has a corporate operation, revenue generated and costs incurred are primarily denominated in the relevant local currency, so providing a natural currency hedge.
In addition, intra-group trading transactions are netted and settled centrally.
Any remaining material foreign currency transaction exposures are hedged as appropriate into either euro or sterling.
Revenue recognised from licensees is primarily earned and received in sterling.
With regard to translation exposures, the policy is to match the average assets of the Group to the equivalent average liabilities in each major currency and thus minimise any impact to the Group.
To the extent that this does not occur, both foreign currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used.
Long-term US dollar borrowings undertaken to benefit from the liquidity of the US dollar denominated capital markets are swapped into euros.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from the Groups borrowings, which, after foreign currency risk hedging, principally arises in euro and sterling.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk whereas borrowings issued at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
To manage these risks, the Group is both nanced through a combination of xed and oating rate facilities and enters into various derivatives.
The Group previously had a policy to ensure that the proportion of xed rate debt to the year end net debt dened for this purpose to include the net book value of eet under operating leases for the next three year ends will be maintained in the range of 45% to 65%, 35% to 60% and 25% to 55% respectively.
Given the seasonality of the Groups debt, the Group amended this policy during the year, such that the proportions are now based upon average net debt rather than year end net debt.
Liquidity risk The seasonal nature of the business necessitates higher eet levels in the summer months and hence proportionately higher debt requirements.
Consequently the Group ensures that it has a core level of long-term funding in place, with maturities spread over a wide range of dates, supplemented by shorter-term facilities to cover requirements through the year.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to a credit risk from its operating activities and certain nancing activities.
The Group controls this risk from a treasury perspective by only entering into transactions involving financial instruments with authorised counterparties of strong credit quality, and such positions are monitored regularly.
Outstanding debts are continuously monitored at an operational level.
Provisions are made against known credit risks.
The solvency of key suppliers, principally international car manufacturers, is monitored separately.
The Group ordinarily has a natural hedge to its exposure to manufacturer credit risk throughout most of the year as vehicle receivables are ordinarily less than vehicle payables see Note 19.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the balance sheet values of the original loans and receivables that are carried in the balance sheet, including derivatives with positive market values.
At the reporting date there were no significant global offsetting agreements that reduce this risk, nor were there any significant financial guarantees for third-party obligations that increase this risk.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classied as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Trading derivatives are classied as a current asset or liability.
The embedded derivative is classied as a non-current asset consistent with the maturity of the borrowing in which it is embedded.
As none of the derivative financial instruments are traded in an active market their fair values are determined using a number of methods and assumptions that are based on conditions at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of future estimated cash ows.
The fair value of interest rate caps and collars are valued using option valuation techniques.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the embedded derivative is calculated based on the difference in the fair value of the underlying loan notes with the call option as compared to the fair value of the equivalent loan notes without a call option.
Hedging instruments The effectiveness of hedging relationships is tested by means of statistical methods using regression analysis.
This involves dening the performance of the hedged item as the independent variable and the performance of the hedging item as the dependent variable.
A hedging relationship is classied as effective when the value of the hedging item moves between 0.8% and 1.25% for each 1.0% movement in the hedged item.
All hedging relationships having been tested using statistical methods were effective at the reporting date.
Forward foreign exchange contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2006 with notional values of US$3.5 million 2005: US$2.2 million and South African Rand 23.6 million 2005: South African Rand 2.5 million were used to hedge expected foreign currency income of US$3.5 million 2005: US$2.2million and South African Rand 23.6 million 2005: South African Rand 2.5 million into sterling of 3.6 million 2005: 1.4 million.
Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2006 with notional values of US$16.1 million 2005: US$9.4 million and Hungarian Forint 1,042.0 million 2005: nil were used to hedge expected foreign currency income of US$16.1 million 2005: US$9.4 million and expected foreign currency payments of Hungarian Forint 1,042.0 million 2005: nil into euro of 12.7 million 2005: 7.5 million and 3.8 million 2005: nil respectively.
Avis Europe plc 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 26 Derivative financial instruments continued These forward exchange contracts and corresponding foreign currency receipts will mature within 12 months of each year end.
Movements in the fair value of these forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised as cash ow hedges in the hedging reserve within equity.
These amounts are then transferred to the income statement when the forecast amounts are received at various dates between one and 12 months after the year end.
There was no material ineffectiveness of these hedges recorded as of the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps of aggregate notional principal amounts of 200.0 million 2005: nil with average xed interest payable of 4.03% were used to hedge variable quarterly interest payments arising under the Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2013.
The aim of the hedge relationship is to transform the variable interest borrowing into a xed interest borrowing.
Credit risks do not form part of the hedge.
There was no material ineffectiveness of these hedges recorded as at the balance sheet date.
Cross currency interest rate swaps Cross currency interest rate swaps of aggregate notional principal amounts of US$390.0 million 2005: US$390.0 million were used to hedge the Groups US$ denominated loan notes see Note 25.
Fair value hedge adjustments of 0.7 million 2005: 22.3 million arise from the hedging of the principal value of the exposures to euro denominated liabilities.
Of this adjustment, 0.7 million 2005: nil relates to hedged items due for settlement within one year and nil 2005: 22.3 million relates to hedged items due for settlement after one year.
Cash ow hedges of 7.5 million 2005: 0.9 million arise from the conversion of the regular semi-annual US$ denominated interest payments to euro denominated interest payments.
Amounts recognised within equity will be released to the income statement when the underlying xed interest payments occur at various dates between the year end and 2014.
There was no ineffectiveness of these hedges recorded as at the balance sheet date.
Non-hedging instruments Transactions are only undertaken to reduce economic exposures and at no time are transactions undertaken for speculative reasons.
However, in certain circumstances these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Forward foreign exchange contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2006 were held to convert the following foreign currency notional amounts into sterling balances totalling 28.0 million 2005: 65.2 million : Swiss Francs 51.1 million 2005: Swiss Francs 57.7 million : Singapore dollar 1.6 million 2005: Singapore dollar 2.3 million : US$5.0 million 2005: US$3.2 million : South African Rand nil 2005: South African Rand 6.0 million : and 71.1 million 2005: nil.
Forward foreign exchange options Forward foreign exchange option contracts as at 31 December 2006 were held to convert expected foreign currency income of: US$0.2 million 2005: US$1.3 million into sterling of 0.1 million 2005: 0.7 million : and US$9.4 million 2005: US$5.7 million into 7.4 million 2005: 4.5 million.
These option contracts and corresponding foreign currency receipts will mature within 12 months of each year end.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of outstanding non-hedging interest rate swap contracts as at the year end was 50.0 million 2005: 105.0 million and 40.0 million 2005: 40.0 million with xed interest rates payable between 4.4% and 5.9%, and 60.0 million 2005: 60.0 million with interest payable at EURIBOR 1.7%.
The notional principal amounts of outstanding interest rate caps and collars as at the year end was 100.0 million 2005: 70.0 million.
In addition, in 2005 the Group had forward start interest rate swaps with aggregate notional principals of 50.0 million which commenced in 2006 and will run for four years and convert the prevailing oating interest rate to an average xed rate of 5.2%.
Embedded derivatives The 250.0 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2013 include a two-year call option permitting the Group to repay the notes with effect from 31 July 2008.
Under the option, the notes may be redeemed at the following redemption prices expressed as a percentage of principal amounts if repaid during the 12 month period beginning on 31 July 2008: 102%: 31 July 2009: 101%: 31 July 2010 and thereafter: 100%.
In accordance with IAS 39, this option is separately recognised from underlying Senior Floating Rate Notes as an embedded derivative.

None of the shares held at the year end are under option to employees, nor have they been conditionally gifted to them.
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust has not waived its right to dividends on these shares.
Avis Europe plc 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 31 Share and share option schemes Details of the nature of all share and share option schemes can be found on pages 38 and 39 of the Remuneration Report.
During the prior year, pursuant to the rights issue see Note 29, and in accordance with the individual share option scheme rules, adjustments have been approved to increase the number of shares under option and decrease where relevant the exercise price per share of any options.
The purpose of these adjustments was to counter the depreciatory effect which the rights issue would otherwise have on the latent value of options.
Exercisable options comprise outstanding options where the vesting period has completed, irrespective as to whether the option exercise price is above or below the current share price.
Movements in the weighted average exercise prices of the Approved and Unapproved Share Schemes during the year is as follows: Approved and Unapproved Weighted average exercise price pence Share Schemes Outstanding options as at 1 January 2005 168.0 Granted in the year rights issue 139.6 Forfeited in the year 105.0 Outstanding options as at 31 December 2005 168.0 Exercisable options as at 31 December 2005 209.1 Outstanding options as at 31 December 2005 168.0 Forfeited in the year 153.7 Outstanding options as at 31 December 2006 120.0 Exercisable options as at 31 December 2006 126.8 Approved and Unapproved Equity Performance Share Weighted average remaining contract lives years Share Schemes Partnership Plan Share Plan Retention Plan At 31 December 2006 4.1 n a 3.5 0.3 At 31 December 2005 5.6 3.7 4.5 1.5 Avis Europe plc 78 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 31 Share and share option schemes continued IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment, requires that the fair value of all share options issued after 7 November 2002 is charged to the income statement.
All of the Equity Partnership Plan options and some of the options from the other schemes were issued before 7 November 2002 and therefore the fair values of these granted options are not recognised.
For options issued after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the option must be assessed on the date of each issue.
The Group uses a stochastic valuation model at each issue date reassessing the input assumptions on each occasion.
No options have been issued or expired in 2006 and, accordingly, the only movements in the year to impact on the weighted average relate to the forfeited options.
The weighted average of the assumptions used in each valuation and the resulting weighted average fair value per option were as follows: Approved and Unapproved Share Schemes Performance Share Plan Share Retention Plan Weighted average 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Share price pence 80.6 80.6 76.8 76.8 42.7 42.7 Option exercise price pence 80.6 80.6 Vesting period years 3.0 3.0 5.5 5.5 2.0 2.0 Option life years 10.0 10.0 7.0 7.0 2.0 2.0 Expected volatility % 49% 49% 49% 49% 49% 49% Risk free rate of return % 4.7% 4.7% 4.8% 4.8% 4.8% 4.8% Probability of ceasing employment before vesting % 5% 5% 0% 0% 0% 0% Expectations of meeting performance criteria % 44% 43% 55% 55% 100% 100% Fair value per option pence 29.2 29.1 37.0 37.0 42.7 42.7 Weighted average share price pence : weighted average option exercise price pence and weighted average fair value per option pence have been adjusted for the changes in the number of options and exercise price arising from the rights issue in 2005 see above.
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the volatility in the share price using rolling one year periods for the five years immediately preceding the grant date.
The risk free rate of return is based upon UK gilt rates with an equivalent term to the options granted.
For options issued prior to July 2003, an expected dividend yield of 6.4% was applied, based on historic dividend yield performance.
For options issued after July 2003, future dividend assumptions were aligned to the dividend expectations publicly announced by the Group.

The merger reserve was recognised in the prior year as a consequence of the Company taking merger relief under section 131 Companies Act 1985 on shares issued to acquire, as part of the rights issue process, an investment in the ordinary and redeemable preference shares in Caelum Limited a company incorporated in Jersey.
Following the subsequent redemption of the preference shares acquired, the related amount previously standing to the credit of the merger reserve has become realised and has been transferred to retained earnings.
The hedging reserve reects changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows.
