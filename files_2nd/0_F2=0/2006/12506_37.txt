87 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 a Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement 2006 On 14 August 2006, the Group entered into an amended and restated 1,085.0m term and revolving credit facility.
This was arranged by BNP Paribas, J. P. Morgan plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as lead arrangers and underwriters and Lloyds TSB Bank plc as facility agent and security trustee.
The Senior Term Credit Facility comprises 325.0m Term A facilities and 200.0m Term B facilities.
The Revolving Credit Facility is a multi-currency revolving credit facility of up to 560.0m or its equivalent in other currencies.
The final maturity date of the above arrangements is 6 June 2010.
In addition the Group entered into a 450.0m bridging loan facility with ABN AMRO Bank N. V. and Merrill Lynch International on 12 July 2006 which was settled on 13 September 2006. b Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement 2005 On 14 August 2006, the Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility were replaced by a combination of the Term A facility, Term B facility and the Revolving facility noted above.
c Loan notes 2008 As part of the acquisition arrangement of Marlow Foods Holdings Limited on 6 June 2005, the Group entered into deferred consideration arrangements with certain individuals.
This resulted in loan notes being issued to the Group.
The loan notes were fully repaid during the year.
Financial instruments The Group is subject to the risks arising from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.
The management of these risks, along with the day-to-day managing of treasury activities is performed by the Groups Treasury function.
The policy framework governing the managing of these risks is defined by the Treasury Committee which itself is a sub-committee of the Board appointed by the directors.
The framework for management of these risks is incorporated into a policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw material requirements, some of which are considered commodities.
These contracts are part of the Group's normal purchasing activities and always result in receipt of raw materials, and are not accounted for as derivatives under IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Fair value The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as publicly traded derivatives is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest-rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts is estimated by calculating the present value using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of foreign exchange option contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date using the Garman Kohlhagen model.
Where the model is unable to revalue the options, valuations are sought from reliable, independent, third parties.
For the purposes of valuing trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, the amounts, paid, payable, received or receivable are assumed to approximate fair value.
For retirement benefit obligations, the measurement of liabilities is defined and related assets are stated at market bid value.
For disclosure purposes the fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Groups functional and presentation currency is pounds sterling although some transactions are executed in non-sterling currencies.
The transactional amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these currencies against sterling.
Management of these exposures is centralised and managed by the Groups Treasury function.
It is the Group's policy to manage the exposures arising using forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency options.
Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions.
Although the Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, the translation exposure resulting from these profits and overseas net assets is not considered material and is currently not hedged.
This matter is reviewed from time to time by the Treasury Committee.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant equity or commodity price risks.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial institutions, and trade receivables are due principally from major grocery retailers though it is the Group's policy to insure trade debt.
Where available the Group has taken steps to mitigate credit risk by entering into master netting agreements such as ISDA agreements.
As permitted by IAS 32, where management have the legal right of offset and the ability and intention to settle such balances net, the assets and liabilities are netted within the balance sheet.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Groups financial assets at 31 December 2006 is represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.
88 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued Liquidity risk The Group has negotiated facilities with its bankers that provide sufficient headroom to ensure liquidity and continuity of funding.
It has adequate un-drawn banking facilities and reserve borrowing capacity.
The Group experiences fluctuations in its short-term borrowing position due to seasonal factors: however, available revolving credit facilities are sufficient to meet the projected peak borrowing requirements.
Cash flow and interest rate risk The Group borrows in pounds sterling at floating rates of interest and seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest rates by entering into derivative financial instruments that reduce the level of exposure to floating rates.
The Group actively monitors its interest rate exposure, since the high level of debt makes its profitability sensitive to movements in interest rates.
The level of fixed capped debt is defined in the Group Treasury policy and procedures.
The Group will maintain a fixed capped ratio of no less than 30% and no more than 75%.
Hedge accounting has not been adopted for interest rate swaps.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Group's non-derivative financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December after taking account of the interest rate swaps used to manage the interest and currency profile was: Floating Fixed rate rate Total m m m 2006 Financial assets 7.8 7.8 Financial liabilities 250.5 398.7 649.2 2005 Financial assets 14.0 14.0 Financial liabilities 296.1 290.0 586.1 The financial assets comprise cash and deposits, which have maturities of less than one year and earn interest based on the treasury deposit rates quoted from banks.
Short-term trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded from the interest rate risk analysis as they are interest-free and are short-term in nature.
In addition, the Groups provisions of 8.2m as at 31 December 2006 2005: 1.0m for retructuring and other liabilities were considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
These cash flows are discounted where the effect is material.
Fixed rate financial liabilities Weighted Weighted average average period for interest which rate rate is fixed % in years Currency sterling At 31 December 2006 4.8 2.6 At 31 December 2005 4.7 3.5 The weighted average interest rates for fixed rate liabilities exclude the borrowing margin as the derivative instruments used to fix the interest rates ie.
swaps are not allocated specifically against individual facilities.
The pricing basis for all floating rate borrowings is LIBOR as adjusted by agreed interest margins.
If default occurs such as a breach of financial covenant the interest margin will immediately rise to 1.20% until the default has been corrected.
The analysis of weighted average interest rates and years to maturity on fixed rate debt is presented after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
Exposure to movements in interest rates and years to maturity on fixed rate debt is also presented after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
The floating rates applicable to interest rate swaps are reset quarterly based on the prevailing market rate at the reset date.
The interest rate swaps are scheduled to mature on 19 November 2007 165m and 30 September 2009 234m.
Also, a new swap commences on 19 November 2007 140m and is scheduled to mature on 30 September 2009.
Interest under these swaps is payable at fixed interest rates varying from 4.5% to 4.9% per annum.
89 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities is presented in the table below.

Such exposures comprise monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiaries involved.
The amounts shown on page 90 are after taking into account the effect of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and other derivative instruments entered into to manage these exposures.
The nominal value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts and other derivative instruments totals 97.4m in sterling.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Set out below the table is a summary of methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instruments.

91 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Fair value estimation Derivatives Foreign exchange contracts are marked to market using prevailing market prices.
Hedge accounting has not been applied to options and forward contracts and as a result the movement in the fair value of 3.5m has been charged to the income statement in the year 2005: 0.9m credit.
Interest rate swaps are marked to market using prevailing market prices.
Interest rate swaps are also not designated for hedge accounting.
As a result the movement in the fair value of 7.1m has been credited to the income statement in the year 2005: 1.1m charge.
Short and Long-Term Borrowings, and Interest Payable Fair value is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.
Finance Lease Liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
Trade and Other Receivables Payables The carrying value of receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to reflect the fair value given their short maturity.
The fair value of non-current receivables payables are also considered to be the same as the carrying value due to the size and nature of the balances involved.

The average lease term is 3 years, the longest being 10 years.
For the year end 31 December 2006, the average effective borrowing rate was 6.5%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date, and thus expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying value.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors title to the leased assets.
