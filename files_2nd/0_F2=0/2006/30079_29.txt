v Substantial share interests The Group has the following substantial interests, all of which are registered and operating in England and Wales: Class of Percentage Shares Holding Principal Name of Company held of Class Activities Rugby Estates Ordinary 20p 12.2% Property investment The Group also held interests in 3% or more of any class of capital in six investee companies.
None of these investments is considered significant in the context of these financial statements.
11 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations, for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement and debtors for accrued income.
The Group has little exposure to credit and cash flow risk.
Unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
This risk is taken into account by the directors when arriving at their valuation of these items.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: market price risk i. e. movements in the value of investment holdings caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement : foreign currency risk: interest rate risk.
The Investment Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
i Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Further information on the investment portfolio and investment policy is set out in the Managers Report on pages 8 to 15.
46 TR Property Investment Trust 12581 Text 8 6 06 1:48 pm Page 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued ii Foreign Currency Risk A proportion of the Groups portfolio is invested in overseas securities and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group may hedge foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency.
iii Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Groups borrowings are at a fixed rate.
A proportion of term loans may be hedged by the use of interest rate swaps and cap contracts.
Short term borrowings are not hedged.
iv Use of Derivatives It is not the Groups policy to enter into derivative contracts other than for the purposes of hedging against price movements in the value of particular constituents of the portfolio or interest rate exposures.
