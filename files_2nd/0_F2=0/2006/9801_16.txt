Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 55 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies Significant accounting policies Marshalls plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 9 March 2007.
The following paragraphs summarise the significant accounting policies of the Group, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements.
a Statement of compliance The Group Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs.
The Parent Company has elected to prepare its Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 88 to 94. b Basis of preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of the requirements of IFRSs in issue and adopted by the EU and effective or available for early adoption at 31 December 2006.
The IFRS accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements and are set out on the Companys website www.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a significant effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 28. c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 55 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 56 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued c Basis of consolidation continued ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
d Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
e Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value and transaction costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when incurred.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see accounting policy f. f Hedging i Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
When the forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding policy statement, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income or expense.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, it no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting.
The cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
ii Economic hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
56 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 57 1 Accounting policies continued g Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of directly attributable production overheads.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
ii Leased assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Property, plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. iii Subsequent costs The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
iv Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation on leased assets is charged over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic life.
The rates are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings - 2.5% to 5% per annum Short leasehold property - over the period of the lease Fixed plant and equipment - 5% to 25% per annum Mobile plant and vehicles - 14% to 30% per annum The residual values, useful economic lives and depreciation methods are reassessed annually.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use.
Costs associated with the development of new stone reserves are capitalised.
Depreciation commences when commercial extraction commences and is based on the rate of extraction.
Provisions for the cost of quarry restoration are recorded once a present legal or constructive obligation exists, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the financial cost of restoration work can be reliably measured.
Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 57 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 58 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued h Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents consideration given by the acquirer in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under the Groups previous accounting framework.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 have been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 and no adjustments have been made.
Goodwill is subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy l. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.
In respect of acquisitions where there is a deferred consideration element an accrual is created if it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and this can be measured reliably.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process meet the recognition criteria for development expenditure as set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The expenditure capitalised includes all directly attributable costs, from the date which the intangible asset meets the recognition criteria, necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
iv Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
v Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The rates applied are as follows: Customer and supplier relationships - 5 to 20 years Patents, trademarks and know-how - 2 to 20 years Development costs - 10 to 20 years 58 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 59 1 Accounting policies continued i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses see accounting policy l. j Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs to completion and of selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity which were incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
l Impairment i Impairment review The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories see accounting policy j and deferred tax assets see accounting policy w, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash-generating unit is the group of assets identified on acquisition that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The recoverable amount of assets or cash-generating units is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairments An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 59 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 60 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued m Share capital i Share capital Share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or is redeemable but only at the Companys option.
Dividends on share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
Nonequity share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders or if dividend payments are not discretionary.
Dividends thereon are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a financial expense.
ii Dividends Dividends on non-equity shares are recognised as a liability and accounted for on an accrual basis.
Equity dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
n Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
o Pension schemes i Defined benefit schemes The net obligation in respect of the Groups defined benefit Pension Scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified Actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of a plan are recognised immediately within the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses as allowed by the amendment to IAS 19 - Employee Benefits.
ii Defined contribution schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
p Share-based payment transactions The Group enters into equity-settled share-based payment transactions with its employees.
In particular, annual awards are made to Directors under a Long Term Incentive Plan.
The long term incentive plan allows Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company: these awards are granted by the ultimate parent.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
Current tax relief is available based on the market value of shares issued.
Consequently, a deferred tax asset is recognised at grant date based on the number of shares expected to be issued proportioned in line with the vesting period.
60 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 61 1 Accounting policies continued q Own shares held by employee benefit trust Transactions of the group-sponsored employee benefit trust are included in the Group Financial Statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
r Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
s Trade and other payable Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
t Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when all the following conditions have been satisfied: the entity has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods: the entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold: the amount of revenue can be measured reliably: it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity: and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods.
u Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the lease.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
iii Financial expenses Net financial expenses comprise interest on obligations under the defined benefit pension scheme, the expected return on scheme assets under the defined benefit pension scheme, interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, dividends on non-equity shares, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement see accounting policy f. Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 61 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 29 3 07 19:52 Page 62 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued v Financial guarantees When Group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
w Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred taxation.
Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred taxation provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary difference reverses, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred taxation assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
x Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
y Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations that either have been disposed of or are classified as held for sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.

Rights attaching to the B shares a Income Holders of B shares are entitled to a non-cumulative preferential dividend at a rate equal to the lower of: i 10 per cent per annum: and ii 75 per cent of LIBOR for six months deposits, as determined at 11.00 am on the first business day of each calculation period.
These dividends are paid semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and 31 December.
b Capital On a return of capital on a winding up except on a redemption in accordance with the terms of issue each holder of B shares is entitled to the sum of 45 pence in respect of each B share, together with a sum equal to the relevant proportion of the preferential dividend which would have been payable if the winding up had taken effect on the last day of the then calculation period.
Holders of B shares are able to make elections to have their B shares redeemed at 45 pence per B share semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December.
At any time after the anniversary of the Scheme Effective Date or, if earlier, when the number of B shares remaining in issue becomes less than 25 per cent of the total number of B shares issued, the Company may elect to redeem all of the B shares still in issue at their 45 pence nominal value.
c Attendance and voting at general meetings The holders of the B shares shall not be entitled, in their capacity as holders of such shares, to receive notice of any general meeting of the Company or to attend, speak or vote at any such general meeting.
Bank loans The bank loans are secured by inter-group guarantees with certain subsidiary undertakings.

The Group primarily finances its operations using share capital, retained profits and borrowings.
The Group has, or had, in issue the following non-equity funding instruments: - Debenture stock at 11.375 per cent as detailed in Note 16 - B shares as detailed in Note 16 As directed by the Board the Group does not engage in speculative activities using derivative financial instruments.
Group cash reserves are held centrally to take advantage of the most rewarding short term investment opportunities.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used in the management of currency risk.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and exchange rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks and they have remained unchanged since 2005.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to review regularly the terms of its available short term borrowing facilities and to assess individually and manage each long term borrowing commitment accordingly.
An interest rate swap, denominated in sterling, has been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure within the Groups policy.
This has the effect of fixing a 6 per cent cap and a 4.5 per cent floor in respect of a three year amortising profile of borrowings commencing at 75,000,000 on 2 August 2004.
The fair value of the swap is adjusted against the hedging reserve at the balance sheet date.
Liquidity risk Cash resources are largely and normally generated through operations.
As explained in Note 3, cash proceeds of 65.0 million including the repayment of all intergroup indebtedness were received on 4 January 2005 on the disposal of the former Clay Products business.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
72 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 3 4 07 17:02 Page 73 17 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating equal to or better than the Group.
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties with whom the Group has a signed netting agreement as well as sound credit ratings.
Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily Euros and US Dollars.
The Groups policy is to cover all significant foreign currency commitments in respect of trade receivables and trade payables by using forward foreign currency contracts.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
Where necessary, the forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts which hedge forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is 795,000 2005: 740,000 and is adjusted against the hedging reserve on an ongoing basis.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.

a Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
b Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
c B shares The fair value is based on market prices.
d Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
e Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.

The assets of the Scheme are held in separately managed funds which are independent of the Groups finances.
After extensive consultation with the employees affected and their representatives, the Group introduced a new defined contribution section to the Scheme to replace the existing defined benefit section which closed to future service accrual on 1 July 2006.
Following this change the Company has made special cash contributions amounting to 10.0 million to the Scheme.
