The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 76 to 83.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 October 2004 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-forsale.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Group is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRS for the first time and these statements are, therefore, covered by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In general, for the first-time adoption of IFRSs, the standards are applied retrospectively.
However, there are a number of optional exemptions available under IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, from full retrospective application.
The Groups approach to these exemptions is detailed below: I.
Business combinations which occurred prior to the transition date of 1 October 2004 have not been restated in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses acquired before 1 October 1998 has been charged directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business acquired after 1 October 1998 and before 1 October 2004 is included in the balance sheet at original cost, less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment as at 30 September 2004.
Cumulative translation differences for foreign operations are deemed to be zero at the transition date.
Any gains or losses on the subsequent disposal of such operations will not include translation differences arising before the transition date.
The net book value of assets which had been revalued prior to the transition date have been treated as deemed cost at that date.
IFRS 2, Share Based Payment, has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that remained unvested as at 1 January 2005.
IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters an exemption from providing comparative information under IAS 32 Financial Instruments disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments recognition and measurement.
The Group has restated comparatives on financial instruments in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39 in order to benefit the user of the accounts and has not taken advantage of the exemption.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and incorporate the results of its share of associates and jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting and jointly controlled assets and operations using proportional consolidation.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an equity interest and over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence.
Investments in associates are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in value.
The income statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations after tax of the associate the equity method.

indd Proof: 12 Proof Read by: Operator: Dave Date: 23 11 2006 Server: studio 1 Set-up: Rob First Read Revisons Notes to the accounts continued 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Joint ventures The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint ventures.
Joint ventures are established through contractual arrangements that require the unanimous consent of each of the venturers regarding the strategic financial and operating policies of the venture joint control.
The Groups joint ventures are of two types: Jointly controlled entities A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses after tax of the jointly controlled entity.
Jointly controlled assets and operations A jointly controlled asset of operation is a joint venture in which the Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own.
A jointly controlled asset is a joint venture in which the venturers have joint control over the assets contributed or acquired for the purpose of the joint venture.
The Group includes its share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the closing exchange rate.
Revenue Revenue is derived from the sale of goods and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed.
This is when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.
Revenue derived from the sale of part processed stocks is based on the payable metal sold.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principle outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received.
Research and development Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure which meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets, is capitalised and then amortised over the useful economic life of the developed asset, otherwise it is charged to the income statement as incurred.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred on individual projects is capitalised when the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured.
These costs are amortised from the point at which production capability commences over their expected useful lives or the life of mine, if shorter, to residual value.
Exploration costs are expensed if they relate to expenditure necessary to delineate and quantify the reserves and resources required to replace those extracted or in the case of expansion and new opportunities, until a probable reserve has been defined and confirmed by a Competent Person.
At that point, further costs are capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives or the remaining life of mine, if shorter, to residual value.

indd Proof: 12 Proof Read by: Operator: Dave Date: 23 11 2006 Server: studio 1 Set-up: Rob First Read Revisons 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Share-based payment The cost of providing equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to employees is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the related share options or share allocations.
The cost is based on the fair value of the options or shares allocated and the number of awards expected to vest.
The fair value of each option or share is determined using either a BlackScholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo projection model, depending on the type of the award.
Market related performance conditions are reflected in the fair value of the share.
Non market related performance conditions are allowed for using a separate assumption about the number of awards expected to vest: the final charge made reflects the numbers actually vested on the basis that market conditions are met.
Business combinations and goodwill At the date of acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking, associate or joint venture fair values are attributed to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Provisional fair values are finalised within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Goodwill, which represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the acquired interest in the fair values of those net assets, is capitalised and is subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with the policy set out below.
Any negative goodwill is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
If an undertaking is subsequently sold, the amount of goodwill carried on the balance sheet at the date of disposal, is charged to the income statement in the period of disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included within intangible fixed assets.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill that was eliminated against reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included in determining any profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately or from a business acquisition are capitalised at cost and fair value respectively.
Where amortisation is charged on these assets, the expense is taken to the income statement through operating costs.
Amortisation of mineral rights is provided on a units of production basis over the remaining life of mine to residual value 20 to 40 years.
Other intangibles are amortised over their useful economic lives subject to a maximum of 20 years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line or units of production basis, as appropriate over their expected useful lives or the remaining life of mine, if shorter, to residual value.
The life of mine is based on proven and probable reserves.
The expected useful lives of the major categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Method Rate Shafts and underground Units of production 2.5%-5.0% per annum 20-40 years Metallurgical Straight line 2.5%-7.1% per annum 14-40 years Infrastructure Straight line 2.5%-2.9% per annum 35-40 years Other plant and equipment Straight line 2.5%-50.0% per annum 2-40 years No depreciation is provided on surface mining land which has a continuing value and capital work in progress.
Residual values and useful lives are re-assessed annually and if necessary changes are accounted for prospectively.
Impairment of tangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

indd Proof: 12 Proof Read by: Operator: Dave Date: 23 11 2006 Server: studio 1 Set-up: Rob First Read Revisons Notes to the accounts continued 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment is recognised as income immediately.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Groups board of directors for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial year, or when such events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Borrowing costs Property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable borrowing costs which are capitalised during the period of construction.
Leases Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset as determined at the inception of the lease.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included within bank loans and other borrowings, with the amount payable within 12 months included in bank overdrafts and loans within short term liabilities.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect the constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
Assets held for sale When an assets carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, to take place within twelve months of the balance sheet date, rather than through continuing use it is classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
No depreciation is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost which includes the applicable proportion of production overheads and net realisable value.
Platinum Group Metals PGMs stock is valued by allocating costs to platinum, palladium and rhodium stock based on the annual cost of production, less net realisable value from by-products, apportioned according to the quantities of each of the three main metals produced.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as the bank overdraft is repayable on demand and forms an integral part of the Groups cash management.

indd Proof: 12 Proof Read by: Operator: Dave Date: 23 11 2006 Server: studio 1 Set-up: Rob First Read Revisons 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes overseas in accordance with local regulations.
The costs of these schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The Group operates two types of pension schemes in the United Kingdom.
Firstly, there is a defined benefit retirement scheme for which the amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of net assets or liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of the plan assets.
The cost of providing for the scheme is charged to the income statement over the periods relating to the employees service.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the income statement in retained earnings and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2006.
For employees who do not participate in the above scheme the Group makes payments in respect of pensions directly to the employee.
These employees have the option to invest in a direct contribution scheme which the Group has set up or they may make their own arrangements.
Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits have been adopted early.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws in force during the periods being reported upon.
Deferred tax as directed by IAS 12 Income Taxes is recognised in respect of certain temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Groups assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where the entities have the right to settle current tax liabilities net.
Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Rehabilitation costs Rehabilitation costs are provided in full based on estimates of the future costs to be incurred, calculated on a discounted basis.
As the provision is recognised, it is either capitalised as part of the cost of the related mine or written off to the income statement if utilised within one year.
Where costs are capitalised the impact of such costs on the income statement is spread over the life of mine through the accretion of the discount of the provision and the depreciation over a units of production basis of the increased costs of the mining assets.
Provisions Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments other than derivatives comprise bank loans, listed convertible bonds, investments, cash and short-term deposits.
Bank loans are recorded at amortised cost, net of transaction costs incurred, and are adjusted to amortise transaction costs over the term of the loan.

indd Proof: 12 Proof Read by: Operator: Dave Date: 23 11 2006 Server: studio 1 Set-up: Rob First Read Revisons Notes to the accounts continued 1 Statement on accounting policies continued The Group has raised debt through the issue of convertible bonds.
These bonds incorporate two key elements.
Firstly, there is the financial liability in respect of the debt element.
This is measured at net present value of future cash flows.
Secondly, the bonds allow for conversion to equity at the option of the bond holder.
This represents an equity embedded derivative.
However, as the Group retains a cash settlement option this equity conversion feature is shown as a financial liability if the fair value is greater than the net present value of the debt.
This embedded derivative is fair valued at each period end with changes in the fair value being taken through the income statement.
Investments are classified into loans and receivables, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired, the nature of the investments and whether the investment is quoted or not.
The classification of investments is determined at initial recognition.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value, including acquisition costs.
After initial recognition, investments classified as available-for-sale continue to be measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised directly in equity.
On disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains or losses in equity are recycled into the income statement.
Loans and receivables and investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortised cost and gains or losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Other derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to manage exposure to market risks from treasury operations and commodity price risks on by-products.
The principal derivative instruments used are foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward price agreements on by-products.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedging derivatives are classified on inception as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recognised directly in equity if effective.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, to the extent that the change in value of the hedging instrument is greater than the change in value of the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Segmental reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in either providing products or services business segment, or is providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Significant judgements The directors consider the carrying value of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment to be recoverable.
These have been assessed for impairment based on value in use.
Assessment of value in use has been based on production continuing at current or higher levels and PGM prices being maintained in-line with current market expectations.
The Group holds a 22% interest in Platmin Limited but has accounted for the entity as an available for sale asset as the Group has no representation on the Board of Platmin Limited and is unable to exert significant influence on the company.

indd Proof: 12 Proof Read by: Operator: Dave Date: 23 11 2006 Server: studio 1 Set-up: Rob First Read Revisons 1 Statement on accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 30 September 2006 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources includes rules for accounting for expenses related to the exploration and evaluation of mineral resources such as minerals, oil, natural gas and similar finite resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the resource can be demonstrated.
IFRS 6 does not mandate an accounting policy specific to exploration and evaluation expenses.
Instead, it sets forth the basic conditions under which the company preparing the accounts selects an accounting method.
Furthermore, IFRS 6 prescribes that impairment tests pursuant to IAS 36 are carried out on exploration and evaluation assets.
Implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups results, assets or liabilities.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures requires extensive disclosures about the significance of financial instruments for an entitys financial position and performance, and qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the nature and extent of risks.
IFRS 7 and amended IAS1, which become mandatory for the Groups 2007 financial statements, will require additional disclosures with respect to the Groups financial instruments and share capital.
Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Insurance contracts.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease provides guidance on determining whether arrangements which convey the right to use an asset in return for a series of payments should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 7 Leases.
The potential impact of implementation of this Interpretation has not been determined.
IFRIC 5 Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds addresses the issues of how a contributor to such a fund should account for interest in the fund and how obligations to make additional contributions should be accounted for.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives requires that a reassessment of whether embedded derivatives should be separated from the underlying host contract should be made only when there are changes to the contract.
IFRIC 9, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2007 financial statements, is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.

We are selling houses to employees to encourage home-ownership.
Any profits or losses from such sales at fair value are not deemed to represent underlying earnings.
Capitalised interest includes an adjustment to the interest capitalised in prior years of $21 million.
The convertible bond contains an embedded derivative which is held at fair value.
Due to the cash settlement option the bond is classified within non-current liabilities and movements in fair value are taken to the income statement.
Fluctuations in fair value are mainly due to changes in share price.
The Group holds both current and deferred tax balances in Rand which is not the functional currency of the Group.
Given the volatility of the Rand to US$ exchange rate the revaluation of such tax balances can cause significant variations in the tax charge and therefore profitability.
Consequently the directors feel that such foreign exchange impacts should be treated as special.

In February 2006 the Group acquired the remaining minority interest in Messina Platinum Mines Limited for a consideration of $13 million.
This represented 8.5% of the share capital of which the Groups share of net assets acquired was $nil.
The consideration paid was based upon the future cash generation expected and consequently the Group has capitalised this investment as goodwill.

The total pension cost for the Group was $40 million 2005 $23 million, $39 million of which related to overseas schemes 2005 $22 million.
The overseas schemes were all defined contribution plans and in the UK there was both a defined benefit scheme, the Lonmin Superannuation Scheme the LSS scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
There were no accrued obligations under defined contribution plans.
The LSS Scheme For the LSS scheme the actuarial valuation was conducted on 30 September 2006 using the following major assumptions: Discount rate 5.0% per annum 2005 5.00% per annum Inflation assumptions 3.0% per annum 2005 2.75% per annum Rate of increase in salaries 3.5% per annum 2005 3.25% per annum Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% per annum 2005 2.75% per annum Contribution rate in the year 25.0% per annum 2005 25.0% per annum Expected future contribution rate 40.8% per annum 2005 25.0% per annum The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 30 September 2006 used PA 92 c2010 tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for pre-retirement mortality 2005 PA 92 c2010 and PA 92 c2020 for post-retirement mortality 2005 PA 92 c2020.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, are detailed in the table below: 2006 2005 Expected return Expected return % $m % $m Insurance policies 5.0 65 5.0 61 Equities 7.6 38 7.5 35 Bonds 4.4 44 4.3 40 Total market value of assets 147 136 Unrecognised assets 5 Value of plan assets 142 136 Fair value of scheme liabilities 136 124 Net pension asset 6 12 The net pension asset shown above has been included in the primary statements.

This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check they are reasonable and appropriate.

No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of the operating losses and the capital losses as it is not considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of any of the underlying differences can be deducted.

Finalisation of fair value on acquisition in 2005 and purchase of minority interests in 2006 In the prior year the Group acquired 100% of Southern Platinum Corporation SPC.
During the year the Group has taken the opportunity to reassess the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the acquisition on 15 June 2005.
In accordance with the treatment prescribed by IFRS 3 Business Combinations, this has resulted in a prior year adjustment.
On 6 February 2006 the Group purchased the remaining 8.5% minority interest in Messina Limited.

Given the expected differential between prevailing share prices and the conversion price of 12.33 it is expected that this will lead to the issue of 10,576,944 shares and a reduction in non-current financial liabilities of $211 million.
Exclusive right to acquire AfriOre Lonmin Plc announced on 15 November 2006 that it has entered into a binding agreement with the Board of AfriOre Limited AfriOre giving Lonmin the exclusive right to acquire AfriOre by means of a cash offer to shareholders at C$8.75 US$7.74 per AfriOre share.
Such an offer, which would be undertaken according to Canadian securities market regulations, would value AfriOre at US$441 million C$500 million.
This transaction has been recommended by the AfriOre board.

Under UK GAAP, independent qualified actuaries valued this on a regular basis every three years.
Under SSAP 24 surpluses and deficits arising from the valuations were spread over the average remaining service lives of employees, with any difference between the profit and loss account charge and the contributions paid included as an asset or liability in the balance sheet where applicable.
Under IFRS, the defined benefit retirement scheme is valued using the projected unit credit method.
Following the amendment to IAS 19, Employee benefits, the Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Therefore, upon transition the actuarial surplus as previously disclosed under FRS 17, Retirement benefits, are required to be fully recognised under IFRS.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become realised.
b Share based payment IFRS 2, Share based payment, requires that share based employee benefits are expensed to the income statement based on their fair value, instead of the intrinsic value required under UK GAAP.
Fair values for the Group schemes, which are all equity settled, were estimated using either the Black-Scholes European option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The fair values are calculated on the date of grant of the awards and the total fair value is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect expected levels of lapses and expected achievement of vesting conditions.
For IFRS purposes share based payment costs are recognised in the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2005 of $2 million.
c Goodwill and intangible assets i Goodwill For UK GAAP purposes, goodwill arising on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Eastern Platinum Limited and Western Platinum Limited purchased on 30 September 2004 was being amortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years.
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, as from 1 October 2004 the carrying value of goodwill is treated as deemed cost at the transition date.
Thereafter this balance is not amortised, but is instead annually tested for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired.
Consequently, for IFRS purposes, all goodwill amortisation recognised under UK GAAP in the year ended 30 September 2005 $2m is reversed.
No impairment was considered necessary.

For IFRS purposes mining rights have been disclosed within other intangible fixed assets totalling as at 1 October 2004 $311 million and 30 September 2005 $286 million.
iii Software During the year ended 30 September 2005 software was purchased and developed.
Under UK GAAP these costs were capitalised and classified within property, plant and equipment.
In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible Assets, since the software is not an integral part of the related hardware this is classified as an intangible asset.
This amounted to $11 million as at 30 September 2005.
Amortisation will commence once the asset is in use.
d Properties We currently accommodate 52% of our employees in hostels and married quarters with the remainder living in their homes.
Under the UK GAAP the houses to be sold in the year ended 30 September 2006 remained classified within property, plant and equipment and measured at net book value.
In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations, the houses to be sold within twelve months are classified as current assets held for sale and measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
This amounted to $16 million as at 30 September 2005. e Financial instruments i Convertible bond and embedded derivative Under UK GAAP convertible bonds were valued at historical cost after deducting issue expenses.
Under IFRS the convertible bonds are classified into two components.
The debt element is included within non-current liabilities.
The underlying liabilities are measured at net present value at the date of issue and recorded on an amortised cost basis.
The equity conversion feature is regarded as a derivative.
This is included at fair value within non-current liabilities, rather than equity, as there is a cash settlement option.
Any changes in the fair value are taken through the income statement.
At the date of transition the interest rate swap associated with the convertible bond was recognised on the balance sheet at fair value and a corresponding adjustment made to the carrying value of the convertible bond to the extent it was hedged.
The adjustment to the value of the bond is amortised over the life of the bond.
The swap expired at 30 September 2005 and the swap was no longer recognised.
ii Loans to Historically Disadvantaged South Africans HDSAs Under UK GAAP the loans to HDSAs were valued at historical cost less repayments.
Under IFRS these are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost less impairment.
The adjustment to bring the loans down to fair value amounted to $13 million as at 1 October 2004 and $12 million as at 30 September 2005. f Dividends For UK GAAP purposes, the Group recognised proposed ordinary dividends payable in the period to which they related.
In accordance with IAS 10, Events After the Balance Sheet Date, such dividends are only recognised when authorised by the shareholders or in the case of interim dividends, when they are paid.
Proposed ordinary dividends payable as at 30 September 2005 of $60 million under UK GAAP are not recognised as a liability under IFRS.
Therefore, trade and other payables and retained earnings have been restated accordingly.
g Inventory Valuation In May 2005 the Group changed the measurement basis of its in-process inventory from tonnage to metal content.
This reduced inprocess inventory by $22 million.
Under UK GAAP this was a change of accounting estimate so no adjustment was made to the opening position.
On adoption of IFRS inventory has been measured on a metal content basis.

A temporary difference arises where there is a difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base.
A temporary difference is taxable if it will result in taxable amounts in the future, when the carrying amount of the asset is recovered or the liability is settled.
The main effect of IAS 12 is the recognition of the deferred taxation impacts of the other adjusting items arising on transition to IFRS.
Income taxes paid during 2005 are classified as operating cash flows under IFRS but were included in a separate category of cash flows under UK GAAP.
i Other impacts The following additional impacts result in changes in presentation and disclosures within the Financial Statements: I.
Investments Under UK GAAP the Group disclosed $48 million of other investments as at 30 September 2005 of which $41 million was considered to be fixed asset investments.
Under IFRS these have been reclassified.
Loans of $33 million to HDSAs which were valued at historical cost are recognised at fair value, carried at amortised cost less impairment and disclosed as non-current other receivables.
At 30 September 2005, $15 million has been classified as other financial assets, representing Petrozim private Ltd. Furuya Metals Co Ltd. and the rehabilitation trust fund.
Share of profit of associate The Groups share of operating profit, interest costs and tax were disclosed separately as part of operating profit, net interest payable and taxation under UK GAAP.
