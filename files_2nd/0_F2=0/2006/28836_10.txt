e Uncertainties and contingencies The uncertainty arising under insurance contracts may be characterised under a number of specific headings, such as: uncertainty as to whether an event has occurred which would give rise to a policyholder suffering an insured loss: uncertainty as to the extent of policy coverage and limits applicable: uncertainty as to the amount of insured loss suffered by a policyholder as a result of the event occurring: and uncertainty over the timing of a settlement to a policyholder for a loss suffered.
The degree of uncertainty will vary by policy class according to the characteristics of the insured risks and the cost of a claim will be determined by the actual loss suffered by the policyholder.
There may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the Group.
Following the identification and notification of an insured loss, there may still be uncertainty as to the magnitude and timing of the settlement of the claim.
There are many factors that will determine the level of uncertainty such as inflation, inconsistent judicial interpretations and court judgements that broaden policy coverage beyond the intent of the original insurance, legislative changes and claims handling procedures.
The establishment of insurance liabilities is an inherently uncertain process and, as a consequence of this uncertainty, the eventual cost of settlement of outstanding claims and unexpired risks can vary substantially from the initial estimates, particularly for the Groups long tail lines of business.
The Group seeks to provide appropriate levels of claims provision and provision for unexpired risks taking the known facts and experience into account.
The Group has exposures to risks in each class of business within each operating segment that may develop and that could have a material impact upon the Groups financial position.
The geographical and insurance risk diversity within the Groups portfolio of issued insurance policies make it not possible to predict whether material development will occur and, if it does occur, the location and the timing of such an occurrence.
The estimation of insurance liabilities involves the use of judgements and assumptions that are specific to the insurance risks within each territory and the particular type of insurance risk covered.
The diversity of the insurance risks results in it not being possible to identify individual judgements and assumptions that are more likely than others to have a material impact on the future development of the insurance liabilities.
The sections below identify a number of specific risks relating to asbestos and environmental claims.
There may be other classes of risk which could develop in the future and that could have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
The Group evaluates the concentration of exposures to individual and cumulative insurance risk and establishes its reinsurance policy to reduce such exposure to levels acceptable to the Group.
126 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2006 Asbestos and environmental claims The estimation of the provisions for the ultimate cost of claims for asbestos and environmental pollution is subject to a range of uncertainties that is generally greater than those encountered for other classes of insurance business.
As a result it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims, particularly in periods when theories of law are in flux.
Consequently, traditional techniques for estimating claims provisions cannot wholly be relied upon and the Group employs specialised techniques to determine provisions using the extensive knowledge of both internal asbestos and environmental pollution experts and external legal and professional advisors.
Factors contributing to this higher degree of uncertainty include: the long delay in reporting claims from the date of exposure for example, cases of mesothelioma can have a latent period of 40 or more years.
This makes estimating the ultimate number of claims we will receive particularly difficult: issues of allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and insurers: emerging court decisions increasing or decreasing insurer liability: the tendency for social trends and factors to influence court awards : developments pertaining to the Groups ability to recover reinsurance for claims of this nature: and for US liabilities from our London market business, developments in the tactics of US plaintiff lawyers and court decisions and awards.
Acquisitions and disposals The Group makes acquisitions and disposals of businesses as part of its normal operations.
All acquisitions are made after due diligence, which will include, amongst other matters, assessment of the adequacy of claims reserves, assessment of the recoverability of reinsurance balances, inquiries with regard to outstanding litigation and inquiries of local regulators and taxation authorities.
Consideration is also given to potential costs, risks and issues in relation to the integration of any proposed acquisitions with existing R&SA operations.
The Group will seek to receive the benefit of appropriate contractual representations and warranties in connection with any acquisition and, where necessary, additional indemnifications in relation to specific risks although there can be no guarantee that such protection will be adequate in all circumstances.
The Group may also provide relevant representations, warranties and indemnities to counterparties on any disposal.
While such representations, warranties and indemnities are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying purpose for the transaction.
These clauses are customary in such contracts and may from time to time lead to us receiving claims from counterparties.
Contracts with third parties The Group enters into joint ventures, outsourcing contracts and distribution arrangements with third parties in the normal course of its business and is reliant upon those third parties performing their obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts.
Litigation, mediation and arbitration The Group, in common with the insurance industry in general, is subject to litigation, mediation and arbitration, and regulatory, governmental and other sectoral inquiries in the normal course of its business.
In addition the Group is subject to litigation in connection with its former ownership of the US operation.
The directors do not believe that any current mediation, arbitration, regulatory, governmental or sectoral inquiries and pending or threatened litigation or dispute will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position, although there can be no assurance that losses resulting from any current mediation, arbitration, regulatory, governmental or sectoral inquiries and pending or threatened litigation or dispute will not materially affect the Groups financial position or cash flows for any period.
Reinsurance The Group is exposed to disputes on, and defects in, contracts with its reinsurers and the possibility of default by its reinsurers.
The Group is also exposed to the credit risk assumed in fronting 127 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2006 arrangements.
In selecting the reinsurers with whom we do business our strategy is to seek reinsurers with the best combination of credit rating, price and capacity.
We publish internally a list of authorised reinsurers who pass our selection process and which our operations may use for new transactions.
The Group monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers, including those to whom risks are no longer ceded.
Allowance is made in the financial position for non recoverability due to reinsurer default by requiring operations to make provisions, in line with Group standards, having regard to companies on the Groups Watch List.
The Watch List is the list of companies whom the directors believe will not be able to pay amounts due to the Group in full.
Changes in foreign exchange rates may impact our results We publish our consolidated financial statements in pounds sterling.
Therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates used to translate other currencies, particularly other European currencies and the US dollar, into pounds sterling will impact our reported consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from period to period.
These fluctuations in exchange rates will also impact the pound sterling value of our investments and the return on our investments.
Income and expenses for each income statement item are translated at average exchange rates.
Balance sheet assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Investment risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on its invested assets.
Credit risk includes the non performance of contractual payment obligations on invested assets and adverse changes in the credit worthiness of invested assets including exposures to issuers or counterparties for bonds, equities, deposits and derivatives.
Our insurance investment portfolios are concentrated in listed securities.
We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity markets.
We have strict controls over the use of derivative instruments.
Rating agencies The ability of the Group to write certain types of insurance business is dependent on the maintenance of the appropriate credit ratings from the rating agencies.
The Group has the objective of maintaining single A ratings.
At the present time the ratings are Afrom S&P and Afrom AM Best.
Any worsening in the ratings would have an adverse impact on the ability of the Group to write certain types of general insurance business.
Regulatory environment The regulatory environment is subject to significant change in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
We continue to monitor the developments and react accordingly.
The directors are confident that the Group will continue to meet all future regulatory capital requirements.
In addition the Group is continuing to monitor and respond to consultation on the latest Solvency II proposals, which are intended, in the medium term, to achieve greater harmonisation of approach across European member states to assessing capital resources and requirements.

The reasoning for the allocation decision is that the business covers multiple risks that are not rated on a single package basis.

There are differences in the total provision for gross unearned premium at the end of the financial year represented in Form 20a and Form 15.
This has arisen due to foreign currency revenue items being translated into sterling using the cumulative average rate for the financial year and foreign currency balance sheet items being translated using year end rates.
2005 Other technical income or charges The amount shown for the other technical income and charges relates to Engineering Inspection income which is ancillary to the provision of Engineering insurance cover.
2007 Material connected-party transactions A number of reinsurance contracts are in place between the companies listed on page 142.
A new contract has been signed in the year between RSAI and Royal Sun Alliance Reinsurance Limited.
No other individual contract is material and all are entered into on arms length basis.
Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc has contracts with other Group Insurance Companies for which movements during the year represent the claims run off experience.
RSAI and Royal Indemnity Company, a US Subsidiary at 31 December 2006, have a Sale and Assignment of Overdue Premium Receivables Agreement.
Under this Agreement, RSAI purchased the rights, title and interest in a portion of the overdue premium receivables of Royal Indemnity Company, as defined in the agreement, in existence as of 31 December 2003 for $51.1 million.
RSAI pays a fee to Royal Indemnity Company equal to 8% of premiums collected on its behalf.

As at 31 December 2006, $11,977 in respect of collections, net of collection fee, is receivable from Royal Indemnity Company.
133 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2006 RSAI and Royal Indemnity Company have a Sale and Assignment of Overdue Reinsurance Recoverables Agreement.

Under the Indemnification Agreement the Letter of Credit secures payment to Royal Indemnity Company for any reinsurance recoverables, as determined by the Royal Indemnity Company and identified in the Indemnification Agreement.
The ultimate value of the Letter of Credit was $150.0 million.
This transaction resulted in an increase to statutory surplus of Royal Indemnity Company of $100.3 million and $144.9 million as of 31 December 2006 and 2005, respectively, through a reduction in the provision for reinsurance.
RSAI and Royal Indemnity Company have an Aggregate Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement.
Under this Agreement, RSAI will reimburse the Royal Indemnity Company for claims made, losses occurring and losses discovered as per the underlying contracts on or before 30 September 2003.

In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the premium, net of commission, will be held by the Royal Indemnity Company.
Interest will accrue for the benefit of RSAI on the funds held balance.
Such interest accrual was $48.2 million and $45.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005, respectively.
As required, the funds held balance, along with accrued interest will be held in a trust account for the benefit of RSAI.

th The US business, including Royal Indemnity Company, was disposed of on 4 March 2007.
2008 Submission of consolidated returns The FSA issued a direction on 27 March 2006, under section 148 of the Act.
That direction requires Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc RSAI, when it prepares and submits a consolidated return, to apply the Accounts and Statement rules so that, or as if, the general insurance business reinsured from P A G I Ltd previously known as Phoenix Assurance plc to RSAI, or any of the firms included in this report, is treated as direct insurance business effected by the relevant reinsurer.
2102 Basis of calculation of provision for unearned premiums The provision for unearned premiums represents the proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of insurance subsequent to the balance sheet date, calculated principally on a daily pro-rata basis.
Both time apportionment and risk apportionment bases are used, the method depending on the fluctuation of the incidence of risk.
134 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2006 2103 Provision for unearned premium The Provision for unearned premium, both gross and net, reported on lines 13 to 15 do not agree to balances reported in Forms 13 and 15 as a result of these balances being translated into sterling using the cumulative average rate when Forms 13 and 15 are translated using year end rates.
2202 Basis for determining claims management expenses Claims management expenses comprise the direct costs of managing and settling claims plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the claims function.
The provision for claims management costs carried forward represents the expected cost of managing outstanding claims from the balance sheet date until final settlement.
This provision is based on attributable expenses for the year and the number of claims outstanding.
2203 Claims management costs: assumed rates of investment return Investment income is not included in the calculation of claims management costs carried forward.
2204 Basis for determining acquisition expenses Acquisition costs comprise all the direct costs of acquiring and retaining business plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the underwriting, sales and customer services functions.
Deferred acquisition costs are determined by applying average acquisition costs to the unearned element of premiums.
2205 Provision for unexpired risk: assumed rates of investment return The requirement for a provision for unexpired risks has been assessed by considering the adequacy of the unearned premium reserves to cover future losses anticipated to arise on contracts in force at the end of the financial year.
No provision for unexpired risks is required as at 31 December 2006 2305 Modification to Form 23 requirements The FSA, on application of the firms listed on page 142, issued a direction in December 2006, under section 148 of the Act.
The effect of the direction is that the amounts referred to in IPRU INS Paragraph 3 3 are expressed in sterling as if the conversion had taken place at the closing middle rate or the cumulative average rate pertaining to the financial year in which the amounts were transacted.
2402 Underwriting year accounting Aviation, marine and marine transport business written in the UK and the majority of treaty reinsurance business is reported on an underwriting year basis as this is how the underlying records and statistics are maintained.
Marine and transport business written by overseas branches, nonmarine transport business written in the UK and certain reinsurance treaty business is reported on an accident year basis.
Claims provisions for business reported on an underwriting year basis are determined using the annual method.
135 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2006 2404 Basis for determining claims management expenses Claims management expenses comprise the direct costs of managing and settling claims plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the claims function.

2406 Basis for determining acquisition expenses Acquisition costs comprise all the direct costs of acquiring and retaining business plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the underwriting, sales and customer services functions.
2501 Basis of calculation of provision for unearned premiums The provision for unearned premiums represents the proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of insurance subsequent to the balance sheet date, calculated principally on a daily pro-rata basis.
3001 Assumptions used in determining yield The yield on the assets covering discounted provisions is the gross redemption yield on those assets.
