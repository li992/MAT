FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below.
Credit risk Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, credit checks being performed on all clients requiring credit over certain amounts.
Credit is not extended beyond authorised limits, established where appropriate through consultation with a professional credit vetting organisation.
Credit granted is subject to regular review, to ensure it remains consistent with the clients current credit worthiness and appropriate to the anticipated volume of business.
Investments are allowed only in liquid short-term instruments within approved limits, with investment counterparties approved by the Board.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset in the balance sheet, these being spread across the various currencies and jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity pro le and cash ows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or re nanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a xed and oating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on oating rates presently as this exibility is being considered to be appropriate in the context of the Groups overall geographical diversity, investment and business cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the bene t obtained from the exibility of variable rate borrowings.
The Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Interest rate derivatives are classi ed as cash ow hedges, and are stated at fair value within the Groups balance sheet.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, Australian dollars, New Taiwan dollars and Korean won.
The Groups principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets is designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
Foreign currency transaction exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or shortterm forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge speci c transaction exposure where appropriate.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension arrangements The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most signi cant funds are described below: United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993.
The scheme is a funded fide ned bene t arrangement with different categories of membership.
The Trustees of the Plan have appointed The Frank Russell Company and Legal and General Investment Management Limited as the investment managers of the Plan.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
The contributions required are determined by a quali ed actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a quali ed independent actuary as at 6 April 2005 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2006.
The contributions of the Group were 20.6% of pensionable salary until April 2006 when the contribution rate reduced to 20.5% of pensionable salary 2005: 20.6%.
In addition, during the year the Group agreed an enhanced contribution to address the plans fide cit that resulted in an additional 1.1m per annum to be paid commencing April 2006.
The contributions of employees were from 3% to 5% 2005: 3% to 5% of pensionable salary.
As the fide ned bene t section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most signi cant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
Korea The Group operates a fide ned bene t pension plan for its employees.
The contributions required are determined by an external quali ed actuary using the projected unit cost method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2006.
The contributions of the Company were 17% 2005: 13% of the employees earnings.
The assumptions which have the most signi cant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
Taiwan The Group operates a fide ned bene t pension plan for its employees.
The contributions of the Company were 6% 2005: 6% of the employees earnings.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2006 2006 2006 2005 2005 2005 UK Korea Taiwan UK Korea Taiwan In ation rate 3.10% 2.30% 2.90% 3.00% Discount rate 5.23% 5.00% 2.50% 4.80% 5.70% 3.50% Rate of salary increase 3.60% 5.00% 3.00% 3.40% 5.00% 3.00% Rate of pension increases 3.10% 2.90% Annual expected return on plan assets 6.17% 4.00% 2.50% 5.77% 4.00% 3.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily borne out in practice.
The present value of the schemes liabilities are derived from cash ow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
The expected annual return on UK plan assets for 2006 of 6.17% has been calculated using a 6.48% return on equity representing 75% of plan assets and a 5.23% return on bonds representing 25% of plan assets.

Details of these schemes are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy, O iv, on share-based payment transactions, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to options.
The charge to the income statement in the year was 0.6m 2005: 0.6m.
The Group applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements at 1 January 2005 except for equity-settled employee share-based payment arrangements granted before 7 November 2002.
The Group has granted employee equity-settled share-based payments in 2005 and 2006.
The adoption of IFRS 2 is equity neutral for equity-settled transactions.

119 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS Management discussed, with the Audit Committee, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRSs requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the year.
The Group evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Certain critical accounting policies, among others, affect the Groups more signi cant estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Actual results could differ from the Groups estimates and assumptions.
Asset carrying values Land and buildings are stated at cost or deemed cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
The assessment for possible revaluation and impairment requires the Group to make certain judgments, including property valuations and future cash ow from the respective properties and investments.
A review of recoverability of property valuations and investment carrying values is made whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
fide ned bene t pension plans The Group operates a number of fide ned bene t pension plans.
As set out in note 19, the calculation of the present value of the Groups fide ned bene t obligations at each period end is subject to signi cant estimation.
An appropriately quali ed, independent actuary is used to undertake this calculation.
The assumptions made by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The valuation of scheme assets is based on their fair value at the balance sheet date.
As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short-term, their values may be subject to signi cant change before they are realised.
Taxation The Group has, from time-to-time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate transactions.
After taking appropriate external professional advice, the Group makes provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which is reliably measurable.
