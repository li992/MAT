Globalisation and deregulation are key themes for the regions in our footprint.
The emergence of a new wealthy class in these markets bodes well.

In recent years, there have also been increasing concerns about United States growth, the dollar and trade imbalances.
These concerns are now joined by questions about ample liquidity, asset price inflation and whether markets are pricing sufficiently for risk.
It is important to be aware of such issues.
At some stage there will be a cyclical slowdown and the benign credit environment will come to an end.
Banks need to be acutely aware of such risks, and must ensure they are prepared and protected.
