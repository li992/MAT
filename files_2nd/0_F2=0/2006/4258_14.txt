The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that resulted in a restatement of the 2004 financial statements on transition were as follows: A charge was recognised in respect of share options falling under the scope of IFRS 2: The deferred tax asset was increased as a result of the additional tax benefit in the year from the recording of share-based payment charges: Computer software was reclassified on the balance sheet so as to be intangible assets: Amounts were reclassified on the balance sheet between treasury deposits and cash and cash equivalents: Tax liabilities were shown separately on the balance sheet: Liabilities related to the purchase of intangible licences under payment plans were reclassified as finance leases: Provisions were split between those greater than one year and less than one year.
The only period effected by the transition was 2004: 2005 was presented under IFRS.
Detailed disclosures for the effect of the transition to IFRS were given in the 2005 financial statements.
