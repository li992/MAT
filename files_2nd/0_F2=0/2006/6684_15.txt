NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1 JULY 2006 1 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS The consolidated financial statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc the group for the year ended 1 July 2006 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 7 September 2006 and the balance sheet was signed on the boards behalf by Sir Patrick Brown and Ian Butcher.
The Go-Ahead Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU as they apply to the consolidated financial statements of the group for the year ended 1 July 2006, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The group is required to comply with international accounting requirements under IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements except in extremely rare circumstances where management concludes that compliance would be so misleading that it would conict with the objective to present fairly its financial statements.
On that basis, the group has departed from the requirements of IAS19, Employee Benets and has accounted for its constructive but not legal obligations for the Railways Pension Scheme RPS under the terms of its UK rail franchise agreements.
Details of the background and rationale for this departure are provided in note 22, including the impact on the groups reported financial performance and position of adopting this accounting treatment as required by IAS1.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The group is required to adopt IFRS in its consolidated financial statements with effect from 3 July 2005.
The results for the year ended 1 July 2006 represent the groups first annual review prepared in accordance with its accounting policies under IFRS.
Previously the group reported under UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
UK GAAP to IFRS reconciliations of equity for 3 July 2004 and 2 July 2005, and of profit for the year ended 2 July 2005 are summarised in note 26.
A summary of the groups accounting policies applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 1 July 2006 are set out below.
The most significant accounting policy changes arising on the transition to IFRS, along with the policies applied on the transition to IFRS on 3 July 2004 are set out in note 26.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except when otherwise indicated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are in relation to the measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets including goodwill see note 9 and the measurement of dened benefit pension obligations, as set out in note 22.
As noted above, the group has taken the decision to depart from the requirements of IAS19 Retirement Benets so as to present fairly its financial performance, position, and cash ows in respect of its obligation for the RPS.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 1 July 2006.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries for use in the consolidation are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent group and are based on consistent accounting policies.
All intergroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
The groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the interest in the joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the groups share of its net assets, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
The group income statement reects the share of the jointly controlled entitys results after tax.
The group statement of recognised income and expense reects the groups share of any income and expense recognised by the jointly controlled entity outside profit and loss.
Minority interests represent the interests not held by the group in GOVIA Limited, a 65% owned subsidiary, and is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the income will ow to the group and the value can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
Rendering of services The revenue of the group comprises income from road passenger transport, rail passenger transport and aviation services including parking revenues.
Bus revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local transport authorities.
Aviation revenue includes amounts receivable generated from contracts in place with Airport authorities.
Parking revenue is generated through the operation and management of car parks and associated services which include security and bus transportation.
Rail revenue includes amounts based principally on agreed models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry, in respect of passenger receipts.
In addition, franchise agreement receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and local Passenger Transport Executives PTEs are treated as revenue, and franchise agreement payments to DfT are recognised in operating costs.
The attributable share of season ticket or travel card income is deferred within liabilities and released to the income statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travel card.
Rental income Rental income is generated from rental of surplus properties and subleasing of rolling stock and railway infrastructure access.
It is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance revenue Interest on deposits is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Uninsured liabilities The group limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties.
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits.
An accrual is made within current liabilities for the estimated cost to the group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
On the basis that the group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date, these uninsured liabilities are classied as current.
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is made after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the group.
Government grants Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.
Where the grant relates to a non-current asset, value is credited to a deferred income account and is released to the income statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset.
34 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Land and buildings are recognised initially at cost and thereafter measured at fair value less depreciation on buildings and impairment subsequent to the date of valuation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Valuations of land and buildings are performed by a qualied valuer, frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying amount.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted on a prospective basis if appropriate at each financial year-end.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives and the lease terms.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on cost or fair value, less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings over 10 to 100 years Rolling stock over 8 to 15 years Plant and equipment over 3 to 15 years The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve except where it reverses a decrease in the carrying value of the same asset previously recognised in the Income Statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the Income Statement.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent of any existing surplus in respect of that asset in the revaluation reserve.
An annual transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to revenue reserves for the depreciation relating to the revaluation surplus.
Upon disposal any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Additionally, accumulated deprecation as at revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Business combinations and goodwill Acquisitions of businesses since 3 July 2004 are accounted for under IFRS3 using the purchase method.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost over the fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS3 at the acquisition date.
It is capitalised and carried as an asset on the balance sheet.
If an acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill, this is released immediately to the income statement.
Some fair value accounting adjustments are made using provisional estimates, based on information available, and amendments are sometimes necessary in the twelve months following the acquisition, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous amounts, and has been subject to impairment testing as at the transition date and annually thereafter.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 27 June 1998 has not been reinstated.
In the event of subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates, goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal to be charged to the income statement.
IFRS3 does not permit the annual amortisation of goodwill, but does require an annual impairment review of carrying values.
This is the approach taken previously by the group, and so the groups accounting policy for goodwill remains unchanged under IFRS3, with the following exception.
Rail businesses are obtained to run rail franchises, which have a nite life.
An annual impairment charge is made on this goodwill to represent its nite nature.
Intangible assets Franchise bid costs A key part of the groups activities is the process of bidding for and securing franchises to operate rail services in the UK.
All franchise bid costs incurred prior to achieving preferred bidder status are treated as an expense in the income statement irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the bid.
Directly attributable, third party incremental costs incurred after achieving preferred bidder status are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over the life of the franchise 7 to 8 years.
Software Software, that is not integral to the related hardware, is stated at cost less amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement evenly over its expected useful life of 3 to 5 years.
Franchise assets Where the conditions relating to the award of a franchise require the group to assume legal responsibility for any pension liability that exists at that point in time, the group recognises an asset or liability representing the fair value of the related net pension surplus or deficit that the group expects to fund during the franchise term.
When a pension deficit exists at the start of the franchise, a corresponding intangible asset is recognised, reecting a cost in acquiring the right to operate the franchise.
If a pension surplus exists at the start of the franchise then a corresponding deferred income balance is recognised, representing a government grant.
The intangible asset or deferred income balance is amortised through the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the franchise.
The carrying value of franchise assets is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the award of the franchise and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Inventories Stocks of fuel and engineering spares are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and costs incurred in bringing the items to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs of sale.
Impairment of assets The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount, being the higher of the assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss, is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
35 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Impairment of assets continued The reinstated amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal, on assets carried at a valuation, is treated as a valuation increase.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classication.
Financial assets Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with IAS39.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The group has not restated comparative amounts on first applying IAS32 and IAS39, as permitted in IFRS1.
See note 26:Explanation of key UK GAAP to IFRS differences.
The group uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated with fuel price uctuations.
Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments, and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows are recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the cash ow hedge results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-financial asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the period which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or otherwise no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of the related non-financial asset as described above.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortisation of liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or other derecognition of debt, are recognised directly in the income statement.
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet, with a corresponding liability being recognised, and are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Retirement benets The group operates a number of pension schemes: both dened benefit and dened contribution.
The costs of these, as described below, are recognised in the income statement within operating costs.
As discussed below, the group has invoked the provisions of IAS1, Presentation of Financial Statements, and has departed from the requirements of IAS19 in respect of the rail pension schemes.
Non-rail schemes The cost of providing benets under the dened benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benets to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of dened benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The interest element of the dened benefit cost represents the change in present value of obligations during the period, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benets paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost, along with the current service cost, is recognised in the income statement within operating costs.
The group has early adopted the amendment to IAS19 to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur in line with the recent amendment to IAS19 Retirement benets.
The dened benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the dened benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benets have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benets already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
Contributions payable under dened contribution schemes are charged to operating costs in the income statement as they fall due.
Rail schemes Our TOCs participate in the RPS, a dened benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK Rail Industry.
This is partitioned into sections and the group is responsible for the funding of these schemes whilst it operates the relevant franchise.
In contrast to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee.
A liability is recognised in line with other dened benefit schemes in the group, although this is offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability represents the deficit that the group expects to fund during the franchise term.
This represents a departure from IAS19 so as to present fairly the groups financial performance, position and cash ow in respect of its obligations for the RPS.
36 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 Share-based payment transactions The group operates equity-settled share option schemes under which options have been granted to employees including directors.
The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS2 and has applied IFRS2 only to options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
The cost of options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, determined by an external valuation using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled options, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc market conditions.
The cost of options is recognised in the income statement over the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised, at each reporting date, reects the extent to which the period to vesting has expired and the directors best estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities for taxation purposes, and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
It is provided for on all temporary differences, except: on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Otherwise, tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares Reacquired shares in the group, which remain uncancelled, are deducted from equity.
Consideration paid and the associated costs are also recognised in shareholders funds as a separate reserve for own shares.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the groups shares is transferred from the reserve for own shares to revenue reserves.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Exceptional items The group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of revenue or expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow better understanding of financial performance.
New Standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: Effective date International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs IFRS1 Amendment relating to IFRS6 1 January 2006 IFRS4 Amendment to IAS39 and IFRS4- Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 IFRS6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets 1 January 2006 IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS1 Amendment to IAS1: Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS21 Amendments to IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates 1 January 2006 IAS39 Fair value option, cash ow hedge accounting 1 January 2006 Effective date International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC IFRIC4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease 1 January 2006 IFRIC5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds 1 January 2006 IFRIC6 Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specic Market-Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 1 January 2006 IFRIC7 Applying IAS29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies for the First Time 1 March 2006 IFRIC8 Scope of IFRS2 1 May 2006 IFRIC9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 IFRIC10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 2006 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS7, the group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their signicance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specically the group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
37 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets, as detailed in the divisional review in the Operating and Financial Review.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

Sharesave Scheme The group operates an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved savings-related share option scheme, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003 the Sharesave Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme is open to all group employees including executive directors who have completed at least six months service with a group company at the date they are invited to participate in the scheme.
Qualifying employees are invited to save between 5 and 250 per month for a period of three to five years.
At the end of that period, employees can apply the amounts saved, together with a bonus, in acquiring shares in the company at a minimum price equal to 80% of their market price at the time of invitation.
There are savings related options at 1 July 2006 as follows: Scheme maturity 1 Jul 2009 1 Jun 2008 1 Jan 2006 1 Feb 2005 Option price 14.62 12.10 4.84 4.90 No.

The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The key assumptions input into the model used for the options granted in the year to 1 July 2006 were: % per annum Future share price volatility 20.0 Future dividend yield 3.0 Future risk-free interest rate 4.7 Forfeiture rate 10.0 Option life 3 years Share Incentive Plan The company operates an HMRC approved share incentive plan, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP.
The SIP is open to all group employees including executive directors who have completed at least six months service with a group company at the date they are invited to participate in the plan.
The SIP permits the company to make four different types of awards to employees free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and dividend shares, although the company has, so far, made awards of partnership shares only.
Under these awards, the company invites qualifying employees to apply between 10 and 125 per month in acquiring shares in the company at the prevailing market price.
Under the terms of the scheme, certain tax advantages are available to the company and employees.

As such this reects the cost of the right to operate a rail franchise.
The brought forward element of the franchise intangible relating to New Southern Railway Limited is being amortised on a straight-line basis over seven years.
The addition in the year comprises 15.1m relating to the opening deficit in the RPS pension scheme and 17.9m relating to the best estimate of the cost of the intangible asset acquired on the handover of the franchise assets relating to the southeastern rail franchise.
The element of the franchise relating to London and South Eastern Railway Limited is being amortised on a straight-line basis over eight years.
The franchise intangible was initially recognised at 17.9m and has a carrying value of 17.4m as at 1 July 2006.
Software Software costs capitalised exclude software that is not integral to the related hardware.
There are no internally generated costs that have been capitalised.
Goodwill As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is annually tested for impairment.
The goodwill charge of 2.4m 2005 2.4m is in respect of rail businesses, which due to the nite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill to be impaired.
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the groups business operations.
The carrying value of goodwill by cash generating unit is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Plane Handling 16.1 16.1 Meteor 15.1 15.1 Southern Vectis 12.6 12.4 Southern 8.2 10.6 Metrobus 6.5 6.5 Wilts & Dorset 14.4 10.6 Brighton & Hove 2.1 Birmingham Coach Company 4.1 79.1 71.3 The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash generating unit, using cash ow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three year period.
Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts using a range of growth rates between 2.25% and 3.0% 2005 3.0%.
The cash ows have been discounted using a discounted rate of 10.7% 2005 9.9%, based on the groups weighted average cost of capital.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cash ows, the discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the budget period.
The directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts and have therefore not presented any sensitivity analysis.
46 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 10 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On 25 September 2005, Brighton & Hove Bus and Coach Company Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary of the group, acquired the business interests of Stagecoach in Lewes and Seaford for 2.8 million including expenses.
15 buses were acquired and 65 staff transferred under TUPE, together with goodwill relating to three key bus routes.
On 2 December 2005, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Birmingham Passenger Transport Services Limited, the holding company of Birmingham Coach Company Limited, for a total consideration of 2.2m including expenses, satisfied by the issue of 64,020 10 pence ordinary shares at 15.62 each being the fair value of the shares on 2 December 2005, deferred loan notes of 0.5m, and cash of 0.7m.
Birmingham Coach Company Limited is a company incorporated within the United Kingdom providing bus and coach services in the West Midlands.
On 6 February 2006, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Hants & Dorset Trim Limited, a company providing bus refurbishment, accident repair and seat re-trimming services to bus and coach operators, for a total cash consideration of 5.5m including expenses on a debt free cash free basis.
On 22 February 2006, Birmingham Passenger Transport Services Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary of the group, acquired the trade and assets of Probus Management Limited, a bus operator in the Birmingham area, for a total consideration of 2.5m including expenses.
The above transactions have been accounted for as acquisitions in accordance with IFRS3.
The acquisition balance sheet has been adjusted to reect fair values and the goodwill arising has been capitalised as an intangible asset.
Management believes that the goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value to the group in respect of non contractual relationships, customer loyalty, and an assembled workforce, for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
A property valuation has been completed.

17 PROVISIONS Depots provision m At 2 July 2005 8.0 Arising during the year Utilised At 1 July 2006 8.0 A significant redevelopment of the depots facilities at one of the groups rail subsidiaries is in progress.
Whilst the majority of the project will be funded by the DfT, there is a risk that the group will need to nd part of the final total cost of the project.
On that basis a provision exists to cover the element that the group currently anticipates it will be required to fund.
It is expected that this matter will be nalised in either 2008 or 2009 before the end of this rail franchise.

The expense recognised for the dened contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is 3.2m 2005 2.4m being the contributions paid and payable.
The dened benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benets based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme Employees of Wilts & Dorset Limited participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme.
This is a dened benefit scheme which is externally funded and contractedout of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Contributions to the Scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
The plan is open to new entrants.
Southern Vectis Group Pension Scheme Employees of Southern Vectis group of companies participate in the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan.
This is a dened benefit scheme which is externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Other non-rail Companies Employees of Meteor Parking, Plane Handling and Metrobus have access to separate dened contribution pension arrangements.
The expense recognised for these is 0.5m 2005: 0.4m being the contributions paid.
The Railways Pension Scheme Employees of New Southern Railway Limited, Thameslink Rail Limited prior to franchise handover and London and South Eastern Railway Limited participate in dened benefit sections of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The RPS sections are all open to new entrants.
The assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identiable and segregated for funding purposes.
The group ceased to operate the Thameslink rail franchise and started to operate the London and South Eastern Rail franchise on 31 March 2006.
There is an adjustment to the balance sheet items as at 31 March to reect this in line with the terms of the franchise arrangements.
The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60% 40% between the franchise holder employee respectively.
52 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term.
The total surplus or deficit is adjusted by way of a franchise adjustment.
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted.
On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS scheme rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.
IAS19 would require the group to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation under the terms of each franchise agreement.
Following industry practice, the group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the groups financial position, financial performance and cash ows, is to recognise its constructive but not its legal RPS dened benefit obligations.
In all other respects the groups accounting policy is consistent with IAS19 and the treatment adopted for non-rail dened benefit schemes.
In doing so, the group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS1 and departed from the requirements of IAS19 Employee Benets in order to achieve a fair presentation of the groups obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit.
The franchise adjustment applied to reduce the groups total obligations under IAS19, is in respect of the deficit projected to exist at the end of each current franchise term and which the group will not be required to fund.
If the group had accounted for the rail schemes in accordance with the full provisions of IAS19 the following adjustments would have been made to the financial statements: 2006 2005 m m Balance sheet Dened benefit pension plan 23.4 30.6 Deferred tax asset 11.4 14.7 Deferred income government grant 13.2 17.3 Intangible asset 1.5 1.0 26.7 34.2 Statement of recognised income and expense Actuarial losses 6.2 18.0 Tax on actuarial losses 1.9 5.4 4.3 12.6 Income statement Operating costs franchise adjustment 1.5 0.8 Intangible asset amortisation 0.4 0.7 Release of deferred income government grant 4.1 4.1 Curtailment gain 2.5 Deferred tax charge 1.5 0.8 3.2 1.8 IAS19 disclosures All of the above plans have been accounted for under IAS19 covering employee benets.

The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and then taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since the inception of the pension schemes.
Consequently the directors are unable to determine the amounts of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the group SORIE before 3 July 2004.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide working capital, funding for the share buy-back programme and investment funds for xed assets and acquisitions.
The group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
Interest rate risk The main risk arising from the groups financial instruments is changes in interest rates.
The boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on bank borrowings is based on re-xing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to six months.
Excluding xed rate debt, the group has net liabilities and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.
Details of interest rates are shown in note 24.
Liquidity risk The group has bilateral arrangements, totalling 145m 2005 120m with prevailing rates and dates of maturity as detailed per note 16.
This gives exibility and management of interest rates obtained.
The group purchases road passenger vehicles by means of hire purchase arrangements or term loans at xed rates of interest over five year primary borrowing periods.
This provides a regular inow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises.
Operating leases The group uses operating leases for some bus and coach purchases across the group where the purchases are made to service specic contracts.
Leasing vehicle requirements on a back to back basis signicantly mitigates the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This has had the effect of incorporating 0.9m 2005 1.7m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The group holds operating leases for its bus eet with an asset capital value of 21.1m 2005 34.6m.
The majority of assets in the rail division are nanced by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent guarantees.
Derivative instruments The group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
The group closely monitors fuel prices and takes out fuel derivatives to hedge its risk to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.
The group benefited from fuel derivatives in place during the year, but as at 1 July 2006 the group had no fuel derivatives in place.
Foreign currency risk The group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material.
Should larger foreign currency transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedging the foreign exchange risk.
Credit risk The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt.
A provision is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cash ows.
The majority of the groups receivables are with public or quasi public bodies DfT, etc.
The group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this the group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
55 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS a Fair values The fair values of the groups financial instruments carried in the financial statements have been reviewed as at 1 July 2006 and are as follows: 2006 2005 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value m m m m Fuel price derivatives 0.3 Fixed rate debt 22.4 22.0 34.0 32.5 22.4 22.0 34.0 32.8 The fair value of all other financial instruments is not signicantly different to their carrying amount.
The fuel price derivatives were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price at the relevant date.
The fair value of xed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash ows at prevailing rates.
b Hedging activities During the year, the group had a fuel price swap in place.
0.6m has been transferred from retained earnings, of which 0.3m was recognised in retained earnings as at 3 July 2005 and the remainder was generated during the year due to the movement in market fuel prices.
The gains and losses on instruments used for hedging fuel price risk are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
There are no net unrecognised gains losses as at 1 July 2006.
The movement in the period is shown below: 2006 2005 m m Unrecognised gains on hedges at start of year 0.3 1.0 Gains arising in the year 0.3 0.5 Recognised gains in the year 0.6 1.5 Gains arising in the year that were not recognised in the year 0.3 Unrecognised gain on hedges at the end of the year 0.3 Gains expected to be recognised within one year 0.3 c Interest rate risk The interest rate prole of the financial assets and liabilities of the group as at 1 July 2006 is as follows: Average Within 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 More than Rate year years years years years 5 years Total % m m m m m m m Year ended 1 July 2006 Floating rate liabilities assets Revolving credit facilities 4.99 20.0 75.0 25.0 120.0 Cash assets 4.55 90.2 90.2 Bank overdrafts 5.50 9.8 9.8 Medium-term oating rate term loan 5.05 5.6 5.6 5.6 5.6 5.7 28.1 Fixed rate liabilities Medium-term xed rate term loan 5.43 11.9 10.5 22.4 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 5.52 14.6 12.7 9.5 6.4 3.2 1.7 48.1 Average Within 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 More than Rate year years years years years 5 years Total % m m m m m m m Year ended 2 July 2005 Floating rate liabilities assets Revolving credit facilities 5.16 70.0 70.0 Cash assets 4.75 98.7 98.7 Bank overdrafts 5.75 12.4 12.4 Fixed rate liabilities Medium-term xed rate term loan 5.43 10.8 11.9 11.3 34.0 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 4.47 15.0 11.2 8.4 5.6 2.8 2.1 45.1 Interest on financial instruments classied as oating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classied as xed rate is xed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

During the year the group transferred in certain assets and liabilities relating to the Southeastern franchise and transferred out certain assets and liabilities on the handover of the Thameslink franchise.
Cash was increased reduced in the group balance sheet as a result of rail franchise handovers, as detailed below: LSER Thameslink Total m m m Intangible xed assets 33.0 33.0 Software 0.7 0.7 Tangible xed assets 25.4 1.7 23.7 Inventories 4.0 4.0 Retirement benefit obligation 15.1 15.1 Receivables 11.7 3.8 7.9 Payables 81.4 19.3 62.1 Cash 21.7 13.8 7.9 57 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 26 RECONCILIATION OF NET ASSETS, PROFIT AND CASH FLOW UNDER UK GAAP TO IFRS First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The group has applied IFRS1, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, to provide a starting point for reporting under IFRS.
The groups date of transition to IFRS is 3 July 2004 and all comparative information in the financial statements is restated to reect the groups adoption of IFRS, except where otherwise required or permitted under IFRS1.
IFRS1 requires an entity to comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date for its first IFRS financial statements.
As a general principle, IFRS1 requires the standards effective at the reporting date to be applied retrospectively.
However, retrospective application is prohibited in some areas, particularly where retrospective application would require judgements by management about past conditions after the outcome of the particular transaction is already known.
A number of optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRSs are granted where the cost of compliance is deemed to exceed the benefit to users of the financial statements.
The group has taken the following exemptions: the group has elected to use fair value as deemed cost for land and buildings at the date of transition: the group has not applied IFRS3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before 3 July 2004: IFRS2 Share-based Payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005: the group has elected to recognise directly in equity all cumulative actuarial gains and losses, in respect of the dened benefit pension schemes, at the date of transition, subject to the franchise adjustment in respect of the Rail Pension Schemes: the group has elected to implement IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 3 July 2005.
The following tables and related notes summarise: the group reconciliation of total equity or net assets from that previously reported under UK GAAP to that reported under IFRS for the transitional balance sheet as at 3 July 2004 and the comparative balance sheet as at 2 July 2005: and the reconciliation of profit after tax from that previously reported under UK GAAP to that reported under IFRS for the year ended 2 July 2005.

Therefore, dividends approved after the balance sheet date cannot be recognised as an accrual in those year-end financial statements.
The final dividend declared for the year which is typically approved in September, is required to be reversed.
At 3 July 2004, net assets were increased on transition by 13.7m, and at 2 July 2005 by 16.5m.
ii IAS19 Employee benets: dened benefit pension plans Non-rail pension schemes In prior periods the group accounted for pensions under UK GAAP using SSAP24.
IAS19 requires the recognition on the balance sheet of any surplus or deficit, of the groups dened benefit schemes as calculated in accordance with the standard.
At 3 July 2004, for the groups non-rail pension schemes, this resulted in a reduction in net assets of 57.1m, at 2 July 2005 87.7m, net of deferred tax.
The income statement is charged with the estimated cost of providing current service benets, together with a pension finance charge or credit representing the difference between the expected return on the schemes assets and the interest charged on the schemes liabilities.
Both the service cost and pension finance charge or credit has been reported within operating costs.
For the year to 2 July 2005, the groups profit after tax was reduced by 1.3m.
Rail pension schemes Employees in our rail businesses are members of the appropriate section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
As explained in the groups accounting policies, the accounting for RPS schemes is on the basis that there is no recourse to the group for any over or under funding of their sections of the RPS at the end of the franchises.
At 3 July 2004, for the rail pension schemes, this resulted in a reduction in net assets of 7.6m at 2 July 2005 5.9m and a reduction in the group profit after tax for the year to July 2005 of 0.5m.
iii IFRS2 Share based payments IFRS2 Share Based Payments requires the group to reect in its income statement the effects of share based payments, based on the fair value at the date of the grant.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The group has used the Black Scholes model to measure the fair value of options granted, and the cost has been taken to the income statement over the relevant option vesting periods, adjusted to reect actual and expected levels of vesting.
The impact on profit after tax for the year to 2 July 2005 was not significant.
58 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 In addition to the charge to the income statement under IFRS2, under IAS12 deferred tax has been provided on share-based payments.
Due to an inconsistency in the rules, whereby tax is recovered on the excess of value at exercise date over the option price, we are required to bring on to the balance sheet at transition deferred tax in relation to all outstanding share save schemes, even though no charge has been taken in relation to some of these.
As a result a 2.5m deferred tax asset has been brought on to the balance sheet as at 3 July 2004 2 July 2005 2.0m and although we will obtain the cash tax deduction, the majority of this asset will never be realised in the income statement as the cash benefit will be taken to the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
This also had the impact of increasing the tax charge in the year to 2 July 2005 by 3.1m.
iv IAS16 Property revaluation The group has obtained a third party professional valuation and elected to use the fair value of the land and buildings at 3 July 2004 as deemed cost, resulting in an increase in net assets at the date of transition of 48.5m net of deferred tax at 2 July 2005 47.9m.
As set out the group accounting policies, on an ongoing basis the group has decided to adopt the revaluation option in IAS16 and in the year to 2 July 2005 a revaluation loss of 1.4m was required to be recognised.
In addition it has performed a review of residual values and asset lives, resulting in a decrease in depreciation for the year ended 2 July 2005 of 0.3m.
These two factors, net of tax, resulted in the reduction in profit before tax of 0.8m for the year to 2 July 2005. v IFRS3 Business combinations The group has taken the option under the transitional arrangements not to apply IFRS3 Business Combinations retrospectively to acquisitions that occurred prior to 3 July 2004.
As required in IFRS3 the group has revisited the acquisition accounting for Plane Handling Limited and Southern Vectis plc, which were acquired after 3 July 2004.
The only adjustments related to the recognition of the dened benefit pension deficit at Southern Vectis of 7.5m, the removal of the previous SSAP24 creditor of 0.6million, and related deferred tax asset of 2.1m, and an increase in the fair value of land and buildings at Southern Vectis of 3.1million and related deferred tax liability of 0.9m.
The New Southern Railway business was acquired to run the rail franchise, which has a nite life.
Under UK GAAP the goodwill in relation to Southern is amortised over the life of the franchise.
An annual impairment charge, anticipated to be equivalent to the goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP will continue to be charged on this goodwill to represent the nite nature of the goodwill.
vi IFRS5 Assets and liabilities held for disposal IFRS5 requires that any assets held for sale, and any related liabilities, should be separately classied on the balance sheet, and any non-current assets classied as being held for sale, should not be depreciated from the date they meet the criteria to be recognised as held for sale.
As at 3 July 2004 2.2m of properties have been disclosed as held for resale 2 July 2005 2.3m.
vii IAS12 income taxes Under UK GAAP deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised when xed assets are revalued unless there is a binding arrangement to sell the revalued asset at the balance sheet date.
Neither is deferred tax recognised when xed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Under IAS12, all taxable temporary differences give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities and must be recognised in full in the financial statements.
The tax effects of the other reconciling items from UK GAAP to IFRS have been included in the taxation charge in the income statement.
The deferred tax adjustments for pensions, property and share based payments have been explained above.
The impact of other deferred adjustments was to reduce net assets by 2.1m at 3 July 2004 at 2 July 2005 3.1m and to reduce profit after tax in the year to 2 July 2005 by 0.8m.
viii IAS16 Software costs Under IAS16 some items of software, which do not meet the criteria of xed assets, have been reclassied as intangible assets.
ix Deferred income An adjustment has been made to defer certain types of revenue streams in the groups rail division.
This has reduced net assets by 2.6m at 3 July 2004 at 2 July 2005 2.9m and profit after tax by 0.3m in the year to 2 July 2005. x Cash ow The transition to IFRS has not had a significant impact on the cash ow of the group.
