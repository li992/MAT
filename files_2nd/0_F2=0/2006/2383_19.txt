The main differences relate to the SEC requirement to use year-end prices, the application of SEC interpretations of SEC regulations relating to the use of technology mainly seismic to estimate reserves in the reservoir away from wellbores and the reporting of fuel gas i. e. gas used for fuel in operations within proved reserves.
Consequently, reserves quantities under SEC rules differ from those that would be reported under application of the UK SORP.
The change to SEC reserves represents a simplication of the groups reserves reporting, as in the future only one set of reserves estimates will be disclosed.
In addition, the use of SEC reserves for accounting purposes will bring our IFRS and US GAAP reporting into closer alignment, as well as making our results more comparable with those of our major competitors.
This change in accounting estimate has a direct impact on the amount of depreciation, depletion and amortization DD&A charged in the income statement in respect of oil and natural gas properties which are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis as described in Note 1.
The change in estimate is applied prospectively, with no restatement of prior periods results.
The groups actual DD&A charge for the year is $9,128 million, whereas the charge based on UK SORP reserves would have been $9,057 million, i. e. an increase of $71 million due to the change in reserves estimates which was used to calculate DD&A for the last three months of the year.
Over the life of a eld this change would have no overall effect on DD&A but the estimated effect for 2007 is expected to be an increase of approximately $400 million to $500 million for the group.
