BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2006 181 5041 BHPB AR06 Pt2 13 9 06 10:11 PM Page 182 Notes to Financial Statements continued 21 Provisions continued c At 30 June 2006, US$2,839 million 2005: US$2,509 million was provided for reclamation and decommissioning costs relating to operating sites in the provision for site restoration and rehabilitation.
In addition, the Group has certain obligations associated with maintaining and or remediating closed sites.
At 30 June 2006, US$1,273 million 2005: US$1,162 million was provided for closed sites.
The Group believes that it is reasonably possible that, due to the nature of the closed site liabilities and the degree of uncertainty which surrounds them, these liabilities could be in the order of 25 per cent 2005: 30 per cent greater, or in the order of 20 per cent 2005: 20 per cent lower than the US$1,273 million provided at year end.
The main closed site to which this total amount relates is Southwest Copper in the US and this is described in further detail below, together with a brief description of other closed sites.
Actual expenditure associated with these activities occurs both before and after closure and can continue for an extended period of time dependent on restoration and rehabilitation requirements.
These reclamation and decommissioning expenditures are mostly expected to be paid over the next 30 years.
The provisions for reclamation and decommissioning are derived by discounting the expected expenditures to their net present value.
The estimated total site rehabilitation cost undiscounted and in todays dollars to be incurred in the future arising from operations to date, and including amounts already provided, is US$6,939 million 2005: US$6,284 million.
Southwest Copper, Arizona, US The Southwest Copper operations comprised several mining and smelting operations and associated facilities, much of which had been operating for many years prior to the BHP Billiton Group acquiring the operation in 1996.
In 1999 the facilities were effectively placed on a care and maintenance basis, pending evaluation of various alternative strategies to realise maximum value from the respective assets.
The BHP Billiton Group announced the closure of the San Manuel mining facilities and the San Manuel plant facilities in 2002 and 2003 respectively.
A comprehensive review of closure plans was conducted in 2004 and continues to be assessed in light of expenditures to date.
The closure provisions for Southwest Copper, including amounts in relation to Pinal Creek litigation, total US$734 million at 30 June 2006 2005: US$731 million.
In relation to Pinal Creek, BHP Copper Inc BHP Copper is involved in litigation concerning groundwater contamination resulting from historic mining operations near the Pinal Creek Miami Wash area located in the State of Arizona.
In 1994, Roy Wilkes and Diane Dunn initiated a toxic tort class action lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona.
In September 2000, the Court approved a settlement reached between the parties for a non-material amount, and the terms of the settlement are now being implemented as a monitoring program.
A State consent decree the Decree was approved by the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona in August 1998.
The Decree authorises and requires groundwater remediation and facility-specific source control activities, and the members of the Pinal Creek Group which consists of BHP Copper, Phelps Dodge Miami Inc and Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co are jointly liable for performing the non-facility specific source control activities.
Such activities are currently ongoing.
As of 30 June 2006, the BHP Billiton Group has provided US$118 million 2005: US$110 million for its anticipated share of the planned remediation work, based on a range reasonably foreseeable up to US$138 million 2005: US$138 million, and the Group has paid out US$53 million up to 30 June 2006.
These amounts are based on the provisional equal allocation of costs among the three members of the Pinal Creek Group.
BHP Copper is seeking a judicial restatement of the allocation formula to reduce its share, based upon its belief, supported by relevant external legal and technical advice, that its property has contributed a smaller share of the contamination than the other parties properties.
BHP Copper is contingently liable for the whole of these costs in the event that the other parties are unable to pay.
BHP Copper and the other members of the Pinal Creek Group filed a contribution action in November 1991 in the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona against former owners and operators of the properties alleged to have caused the contamination.
As part of this action, BHP Copper is seeking contribution from its predecessors in interest with respect to BHP Coppers ultimate allocated share of costs, based upon such predecessors proportionate contributions to the total contamination in the Pinal Creek drainage basin.
Such action seeks recovery from these historical owners and operators for remediation and source control costs.
BHP Coppers predecessors have asserted a counterclaim in this action seeking indemnity from BHP Copper based upon their interpretation of the historical transaction documents relating to the succession in interest of the parties.
BHP Copper has also filed suit against a number of insurance carriers seeking to recover under various insurance policies for remediation, response, source control, and other costs noted above incurred by BHP Copper.
Other closed sites The closure provisions for other closed sites total US$539 million at 30 June 2006 2005: US$431 million.
