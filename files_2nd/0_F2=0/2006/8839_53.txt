94 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2006 18 Financial instruments The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained pro ts and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at oating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps as cash ow hedges to generate the desired interest pro le and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
The Groups long-term policy is to maintain approximately 50% of its borrowings at xed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2006, approximately 51% 2005 : 45% of the Groups borrowings were at xed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk As regards liquidity, the Groups policy has throughout the year been that, to ensure continuity of funding, at least 90% of the Group borrowing facilities excluding joint ventures should mature in more than one year.
At 31 December 2006, 96% 2005 : 96% of the Group borrowing facilities were due to mature in more than one year.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group also has signi cant overseas subsidiaries whose revenues and expenses are denominated in other currencies.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from movements in exchange rates, the Group nances its net investment in non US dollar subsidiaries primarily by means of borrowings denominated in the appropriate currency.
Some of the sales of the Groups businesses are to customers in overseas locations.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all signi cant currency exposures on sales at the time of the transaction through forward currency contracts.
Where the Group does not hedge account for these forward contracts, changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of receivables.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to any signi cant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.

The foreign exchange loss of US$14.3m 2005 : gain US$2.1m on translation of the borrowings into US dollars has been recognised in the currency translation reserve.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments.
Long-term borrowings are generally rolled over for periods of three months or less.
