Further information relating to the individual directors is provided in the directors remuneration report on pages 40 to 45.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the groups operations.
The group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The group also uses derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and caps, and forward currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the groups long-term variable rate debt obligations and its cash and bank balances.
The groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of xed and variable rate debt and specically to keep between 60% and 80% of its borrowings at xed or capped rates of interest.
At 31 December 2006, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps and caps, approximately 64.8% 2005: 84.7% of the groups term borrowings are at a xed or capped rate of interest.
Foreign currency risk The group uses forward currency contracts to manage the currency exposure on transactions significant to its operations.
It is the groups policy not to enter into forward contracts until a rm commitment is in place and to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.
81 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 31 December 2006 32 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the groups exposure to bad debts is not considered significant.
At 31 December 2006, the groups five largest customers accounted for 66.3% of outstanding trade receivables and work in progress 2005: 69.8%.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and certain derivative instruments, the groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Liquidity risk The groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of overdrafts, revolving credit facilities, project finance and term loans.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of the groups financial instruments as compared to their carrying amounts included within the groups balance sheet are set out below: Carrying amount Fair value 2006 2005 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Financial assets Cash and short-term deposits 457,848 208,896 457,848 208,896 Restricted cash 883 1,648 883 1,648 Available-for-sale financial assets 1,726 2,413 1,726 2,413 Interest rate caps and swaps 568 672 568 672 Forward currency contracts 8,840 8,840 Forward currency purchase option 461 461 Financial liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 117,180 106,870 117,180 106,870 Deferred consideration 7,373 4,450 7,373 4,450 Interest rate swaps 147 147 Forward currency contracts 11,452 11,452 Market values have been used to determine the fair values of available-for-sale financial assets and forward currency contracts.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and caps have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
The Company considers that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, other current and non-current financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values and are therefore excluded from the above table.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the groups interest-bearing financial liabilities and assets.
The following table indicates the years over which these financial liabilities and assets will reprice or mature: Year ended 31 December 2006 Within 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 More than 1 year years years years years 5 years Total US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Financial liabilities Floating rates Revolving credit facilities 6,500 443 1,994 6,427 15,364 Short-term loan 6,033 6,033 Bank overdrafts 20,442 20,442 Term loan 2,500 10,000 11,250 15,625 37,736 77,111 26,475 9,000 10,000 11,693 17,619 44,163 118,950 Financial assets Floating rates Cash and short-term deposits 457,848 457,848 Restricted cash balances 883 883 458,731 458,731 82 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2006 Year ended 31 December 2005 Within 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 More than 1 year years years years years 5 years Total US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Financial liabilities Floating rates Revolving credit facilities 8,900 404 1,817 2,827 3,029 16,977 Short-term loan 6,228 6,228 Bank overdrafts 6,055 6,055 Project term loan 7,000 7,000 Term loan 2,500 10,000 11,250 15,625 18,750 13,897 72,022 30,683 10,000 11,654 17,442 21,577 16,926 108,282 Financial assets Floating rates Cash and short-term deposits 208,896 208,896 Restricted cash balances 1,648 1,648 210,544 210,544 Financial liabilities in the above table are disclosed gross of debt acquisition costs of US$1,770,000 2005: US$1,412,000.
Interest on financial instruments classied as oating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
The other financial instruments of the group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Derivative instruments designated as cash ow hedges At 31 December 2006, the group held the following derivative instruments, designated as cash ow hedges in relation to oating rate interestbearing loans and borrowings: Fair value asset liability 2006 2005 Instrument Period to maturity Date commenced US$000 US$000 UK LIBOR interest rate swap 2 years and 9 months 31 December 2004 77 147 UK interest rate cap 1 year 31 December 2004 4 5 US LIBOR interest rate swap 1 year 31 December 2004 487 667 Foreign currency risk The group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are entered into in a currency other than US dollars.
The group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk, when considered appropriate.
At 31 December 2006, the group had foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges with a fair value gain of US$8,840,000 2005: fair value loss US$11,452,000 as follows: Net unrealised Contract value Fair value gain loss 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Euro currency purchases 203,908 344,107 212,694 332,689 8,786 11,418 Sterling currency purchases 3,901 36,896 4,098 36,862 197 34 Yen currency purchases 13,379 13,236 143 8,840 11,452 The above foreign exchange contracts mature between January 2007 and February 2008 2005: between January 2006 and June 2007.
During 2005, the group acquired an option from a bank to purchase Euro currency equivalent to US$31,368,000 by paying a premium of US$689,000.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the option was US$461,000 with an unrealised loss deferred in equity of US$228,000.
In October 2006, the option was exercised and a gain of US$105,000 was recognised in the income statement.
83 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 31 December 2006 33 Events after the balance sheet SPD Group Limited On 16 January 2007, the group acquired a 51% interest in the share capital of SPD Group Limited SPD, a specialist provider of well operations services.
The consideration for the acquisition of the 51% interest inclusive of estimated transaction costs of US$172,000 was US$7,872,000.
Consideration of US$7,700,000 excluding transaction costs was settled by a cash payment of US$3,935,000, issuance of loan notes payable of US$1,765,000 and the balance of US$2,000,000 by issuance of 274,938 new ordinary shares of the Company at market value at the date of issue to the vendor over three years in equal instalments on the anniversary of the transaction.
The terms of the sale and purchase agreement for the remaining 49% interest in the share capital of SPD which convey call option rights on the acquirer and minority shareholder put option rights over these shares and the respective rights to dividends and share of profits of the two parties are such that this transaction has been accounted for as a 100% acquisition of the business by the group.
The discounted deferred consideration for the remaining 49% of the share capital of SPD has been estimated at US$12,025,000 and this will be reassessed each year to fair value and any adjustment to the deferred consideration arising will be reected in goodwill except for the unwinding of interest which will be reected in the income statement as an interest expense.
The total consideration for the 100% interest therefore, including transaction costs, amounts to US$19,897,000.
The 100% fair values of the identiable assets and liabilities of SPD Group Limited at the date of acquisition are analysed below and these are provisional pending final agreement with the vendor.
