Kensington Group plc Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2006 55 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 30 November 2006 1.
Accounting policies Kensington Group plc is a company registered in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 81.
The nature of the Groups principal activity is set out in the Operating and Financial Review and Directors Report.
Basis of Accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRIC Interpretations that, under European Regulations, are effective at the Groups first reporting date under IFRS, 1 December 2005, and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Previously the Group prepared financial information in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements there were Standards and Interpretations that were in issue but not yet effective which have not been applied in these financial statements.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the Group except for the additional financial instrument and capital disclosures required by IFRS 7 and the related amendment to IAS 1 when effective.
The 30 November 2005 comparative figures have been restated from UK GAAP where necessary to comply with IFRS adoption.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in respect of the adoption of IAS 32 and 39 for the comparatives and accordingly has applied the requirements of these standards from 1 December 2005.
The transitional reconciliations required under IFRS 1 are set out in Notes 31 to 35.
The Company has not taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in respect of the adoption of IAS 32 and 39.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.
In addition, an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of IFRS in the year are set out in Notes 31 to 35.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, where required by IAS 39.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company, all its subsidiaries including Special Purpose Vehicles that are consolidated in accordance with SIC 12 over which the Group has control and interest in joint ventures together the Group drawn up to 30 November 2006.
Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of the profit and loss and net assets not held by the Group.
They are presented separately to the Groups, in the consolidated income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Minority interest consists of the amount of those interests at the date of original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since that date.

Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation continued These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, the Groups presentation currency.
The assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to reserves.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Income recognition Investment income and expense effective interest rate For all financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost including mortgage balances and financing, investment income and expenses are recognised in the Income Statement on an Effective Interest Rate EIR basis.
Under IAS 39, the Groups mortgage loan assets are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the initial advance net of any fees or other charges paid or received and then subsequently measured on an amortised cost basis.
This requires that, for all loan assets, revenue is recognised over the estimated not contractual life of the mortgage loan, taking into account all incremental income and expenditure directly attributable to the loan, in the same way that all these factors would be taken into account in determining an investment return for a product.
The rate at which revenue is recognised is referred to as the EIR and is equivalent to the rate that effectively discounts estimated future cash flows throughout the estimated life to the net carrying value of the loan.
The revenue stream includes interest, upfront fees, estimated early redemption charges, upfront costs such as procurement fees, commissions and other external fees paid, all of which are spread across the expected life of the loan using the EIR.
The effect of discounts and fixed rates offered are spread over the expected life of the loan rather than the discount period.
In respect of financial liabilities, the Group incurs set up costs in arranging financing.
These incremental set up costs are spread across the expected repayments of the liabilities at the EIR which is equivalent to the rate that discounts estimated future cash flows throughout the estimated life to the net carrying value of the liabilities.
Any fees, commissions, charges, interest or other cash flows forming part of the yield for financial asset and liabilities and recognised as profit or loss through the EIR calculation, are presented within investment income and expense respectively in the Income Statement.
Profit on sale of mortgages The Group periodically sells portfolios of mortgages to external third parties.
The profit on sale of these mortgages represents the excess of the consideration received over amortised cost of the mortgages, less the transaction costs.
Impairment of mortgage balances Impairment is only recognised when following an impairment event after initial recognition, there is objective evidence to suggest at the balance sheet date that the value of the loan is impaired.
The impairment provision on any loan is that amount which would reduce the carrying value of the asset to the estimated value of the future cash flows related to the loan, including realisation of collateral, discounted at the original EIR.
Evidence of impairment events include default or delinquency in interest or principal payments.
Once an impairment event has occurred future cash flows are estimated on the basis of historical loss experience, adjusted to reflect the prevailing economic conditions.
Leasing Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Kensington Group plc Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2006 57 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 30 November 2006 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Information technology development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset delivering benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised.
The costs that are capitalised are then written off to the income statement on a straight-line basis over three years from the date the asset created came into use within the business.
Pension costs The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme and contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
As permitted by IFRS 1, unamortised goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Investments in joint ventures In the Groups financial statements, investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of the joint ventures profits less losses while the Groups share of the net assets of the joint venture is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Available for sale investments Unquoted equity investments have been classified as available-for-sale, and are recognised initially and measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Unrealised gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Any dividends are recognised in the income statement when the right of payment has been established, Where the fair value of unquoted securities cannot be measured reliably because there is no observable price or alternative reliable method of estimating fair value, these investments are measured at cost.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and net of any provision for impairment.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the lives of the assets on a straight-line basis.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Short-term leasehold property Over the period of the lease Computer equipment 25% per annum and 33% per annum Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 20% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum Development costs 33% per annum Kensington Group plc Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2006 58 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 30 November 2006 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Financial Instruments Mortgage loans Mortgage loans are considered to be loans and receivables as defined by IAS 39.
They are therefore accounted for on an amortised cost basis.
On initial recognition, mortgage loans are recorded at the initial advance net of any fees or other charges paid or received that form part of the EIR.
Thereafter they are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate, less any provision where the mortgage loans are considered to be impaired.
Mortgage loans are derecognised when the rights to receive the cash flows have expired.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise the mortgage backed floating rate notes, short-term loans, bank loans and the subordinated loan.
Financial liabilities are initially recorded in the balance sheet as the proceeds received net of any direct issue costs.
On subsequent reporting dates, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost based on the original effective interest rate.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are recognised in the Groups balance sheet on a trade date basis.
Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are transacted by the Group purely for hedging purposes, in line with approved risk management policies.
The Group does not enter into such derivatives for speculative purposes.
Refer to the Directors Report for further details of the approved risk management policies.
The Group transacts interest rate swap, interest rate cap and cross currency interest rate swap contracts to alter the risk profile of existing underlying exposures of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Derivatives are held in the balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise, within investment income in respect of the interest rate and interest rate cap derivatives and within financing costs in respect of the cross currency interest rate swaps.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and are effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the hedged cash flow affects the income statement, the effective portion recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement in the period or periods that the hedged cash flow affects it.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or is dedesignated.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement immediately.
The fair value for interest rate and foreign currency derivatives is estimated using discounted cash flow models based on quoted market interest rates and foreign currency prices.
Equity options The Group has an investment in two unquoted companies, Money Partners Holdings Limited and Start Mortgages Holding Limited, and has an option to increase its ownership in the ordinary shares of those entities.
These options are classified as derivative instruments and accordingly the estimated fair value of these options is included in the balance sheet and the movement in their fair value taken to the income statement.
The fair value of the equity options is calculated using a Black Scholes model.

Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Mortgage-backed floating rate notes included in financial liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date, are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the reporting date.
Any exchange differences arising in the period on the settlement or retranslation of foreign currency liabilities are included in the income statement within finance costs.
Share based payments The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled shared based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market based vesting conditions.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the options, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Kensington Group plc share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors.
As permitted by IFRS 1, only those options which were granted after 7 November 2002, and not vested by 1 December 2005, have been restated on transition to IFRS.
Taxation Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax at a future date, at the rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements knowledge of the amount, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The most significant use of accounting judgements and estimates are: EIR In order to determine the EIR applicable to mortgage loans, an estimate must be made of the expected life of each mortgage loan and hence the cash flows related thereto.
These estimates are based on historical data and reviewed as appropriate.
The accuracy of the EIR applied would therefore be compromised by any differences between actual borrower behaviour and that predicted.
Any changes in these estimates will result in an adjustment to the carrying value of the mortgage assets.
The corresponding charge or release to the income statement will be included in the period in which the estimates are revised.
Impairment losses on mortgages The level of potential credit losses is uncertain and depends on a number of factors such as unemployment levels, interest rates, house price levels and other general economic conditions.
The Group bases impairment provisions on estimates based on historical loss experience.
Actual cash flows on financial assets may differ from management estimates, resulting in an increase or decrease of impairment charges and provisions.
Segmental information The Group considers that the dominant business risks and returns are within one business segment, being the provision of a range of mortgage loans.
The Groups operations are materially all within one geographical market, being the United Kingdom.

The deferred consideration, if any, is calculated by reference to MPLs audited post tax profit for the year ending 30 November 2008.
The Group continues to share control of MPL with the other Founder Shareholder since the Group is precluded from making key decisions around the financial, strategic and operating policies of the business without the approval of the other Founder Shareholder.
Accordingly, despite the increase in shareholding to 57.5% from 20%, it will continue to be treated as a joint venture and accounted for using the equity method.

Deferred tax asset The movement on the deferred tax asset is as follows: 2006 2005 Group m m Balance at 1 December 0.5 3.5 Charge for the year 0.3 3.0 Credit directly to equity 2.5 Transfer to interest in joint venture 0.2 Balance at 30 November 2.5 0.5 The deferred tax asset is made up as follows: 2006 2005 m m Tax relief on share based remuneration 2.5 Other timing differences 0.5 Total 2.5 0.5 The deferred tax asset has been recognised in accordance with IAS 12 on the grounds that sufficient future taxable profits will arise for the asset to be recovered.
The directors consider this is justified on the basis of the strong growth in profitability of the Group in recent accounting periods and have no reason to believe that profits will not arise in the future.
Such profits include income expected to arise on assets already securitised.
In accordance with IAS 12 the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 2.5m being the estimated value of future corporation tax deductions available, in respect of those employee share options currently in issue.
This valuation of the deduction is based on the difference between the current share price and the option price of each employee share option in issue at the year end, and the benefit of this recognition has been taken directly to equity.

Short-term loan facilities at 30 November 2006 amounted to 2,873m 2005: 1,567.4m and are only available to fund the origination of mortgages.
These include facilities of 1bn 2005: 375m in respect of the operation of Start Mortgages Limited in the Republic of Ireland.
ii Bank loans are secured by charges over specific cash flows from SPV Companies.
iii As at 30 November 2006, 125m 2005: 75m of principal was outstanding.
The subordinated debt has a fixed rate of 9% per annum and is due for repayment in December 2015. iv Mortgage backed floating rate notes have been issued by SPV Companies in order to finance the purchase of certain mortgage loans originated by the Group.
The SPV Companies are ultimately beneficially owned by charitable trusts.
The Group is not obliged to support any losses of the SPV Companies and does not intend to do so.
The terms and conditions of the securitisations provide that the note holders will receive interest and repayment of principal only to the extent that sufficient funds are generated by the mortgage portfolios acquired by the SPV Companies.
Note holders have no recourse to the Group in any form.
The SPV Companies have the option to call the notes before the contractual dates.
The priority and amount of claims on the proceeds generated by the assets are determined in accordance with a strict priority of payments.
The Group is entitled to further deferred consideration or residual income depending on the performance of the SPV Companies, although the proceeds already received by the Group from the securitisation of the mortgage loans are non-returnable.
The Group has an option to sell further mortgages to the same SPV Companies over a fixed period of time.
The SPV Companies have undrawn committed loan facilities of 623.8m 2005: 559.6m to provide short-term funding for income shortfalls.
The maturity profile of the mortgage backed floating rate loan notes issued by the SPV Companies has not been included as these are repaid in line with the redemption profile of the securitised mortgages.
The average expected life of securitised mortgages is between three and four years.
Kensington Group plc Notes to the financial statements Annual report and accounts 2006 70 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 30 November 2006 continued 22.
Interest rate profile The Groups policy is to maintain floating rate assets and broadly match these with floating rate liabilities, hedging fixed rate assets by the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps and caps.
The rates of interest payable on the short-term loans, bank loans and mortgage-backed floating rate notes are reset either monthly or quarterly on the basis of Libor.
The interest rates being charged on the Groups variable rate mortgages are determined by reference to the Groups funding costs, the underwriting risk and rates being charged on similar products in the marketplace.
With the exception of the 134.6m of fixed-rate subordinated debt, all the Groups financial liabilities are reset to floating rate at least every three months.
All foreign currency floating rate notes are swapped into GBP Libor by the cross currency interest rate swaps.
There are no non-interest bearing financial assets or liabilities.
As at 30 November 2006, 41.5% approximately 2,956m of the outstanding mortgage loans were still within their initial fixed rate period.
To minimise the exposure to interest rate risk, the Group has 2,992m of interest rate swaps outstanding to hedge these fixed-rate mortgages and a proportion of the undrawn fixed-rate mortgages offered to customers.
The interest rate and currency profile of the mortgage-backed floating rate notes is as follows: 2006 Floating Margin m rate range Pound sterling 3,044.7 Libor 0.04% 3.80% US Dollar 572.7 USD Libor 0.01% 3.00% Euro 2,321.0 Euribor 0.07% 3.55% 5,938.4 The EIR on the mortgage-backed floating rate notes approximates to the contractual interest rates on the notes.
The margin range reflects the variety of floating rate notes issued by the SPV Companies ranging from AAA rated to BB rated.
All liabilities in respect of foreign currency mortgage-backed floating rate notes have been swapped into Sterling.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is considered to be materially the same as the carrying value because floating rate assets and liabilities reset to market on a regular basis and the average period of the fixed rate mortgage assets is less than two years.
