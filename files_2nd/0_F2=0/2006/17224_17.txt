72 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2006 Notes to the financial statements 52 weeks ended 29 January 2006 42 Pension liabilities Defined benefit pension scheme The Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at 6 April 2005 and were updated for FRS 17 Retirement benefits purposes for the periods to 29 January 2006 and 30 January 2005 by a qualified independent actuary.
The current joint employer employee contribution rate of 16.8% of pensionable pay that applied from 6 April 2005 will continue to apply until the review following the next annual valuation of the scheme due as at 6 April 2006.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes liabilities were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Rate of increases in salaries 4.25 5.25% 4.25 5.25% 4.25 5.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.75% 5.25% 5.50% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics.
The current mortality table used is PA92 C2020.
The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00% Bonds 4.25% 5.00% 5.25% Property 7.00% N A N A Cash 4.50% 4.75% 4.00% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 m m m Equities 252.4 205.2 163.9 Bonds 34.4 11.5 11.4 Property 0.7 Cash 18.9 10.9 3.5 Total market value of assets 306.4 227.6 178.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 381.3 299.6 246.7 Deficit in the scheme pension liability 74.9 72.0 67.9 Related deferred tax asset 22.5 21.6 20.4 Net pension liability in the balance sheet 52.4 50.4 47.5 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2006 73 Notes to the financial statements 52 weeks ended 29 January 2006 42 Pension liabilities continued The movement in the deficit during the period was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 m m m Deficit in the scheme at start of the period 72.0 67.9 28.7 Current service cost 21.6 19.5 13.6 Contributions 24.9 24.1 23.6 Other finance income costs 0.8 1.1 0.1 Actuarial loss 7.0 7.6 49.1 Deficit in the scheme at end of period 74.9 72.0 67.9 Profit and loss account impact The following amounts have been charged in arriving at operating profit in respect of pension costs: 2006 2005 m m Current service cost 21.6 19.5 The following amounts have been included in other finance income: 2006 2005 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 17.2 13.1 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 16.4 14.2 0.8 1.1 Amounts recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses The amounts included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses were: 2006 2005 m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 35.4 7.5 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 4.2 1.8 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 46.6 16.9 Actuarial loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 7.0 7.6 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 History of experience gains and losses m m m m m Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount 35.4 7.5 24.9 44.0 29.4 Percentage of scheme assets 11.6% 3.3% 13.9% 37.3% 21.8% Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities: Amount 4.2 1.8 3.4 2.6 2.4 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 1.1% 0.6% 1.4% 1.8% 1.9% Effects to changes in the demographic and financial assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities: Amount 46.6 16.9 70.6 4.4 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 12.2% 5.6% 28.6% 0.0% 3.4% Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount 7.0 7.6 49.1 41.4 27.4 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 1.8% 2.5% 19.9% 28.3% 21.5% 74 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2006 Notes to the financial statements 52 weeks ended 29 January 2006 42 Pension liabilities continued Defined contribution pension scheme Employees joining the company after September 2000 are no longer eligible to gain automatic entry into the final salary pension scheme.
