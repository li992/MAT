The following table shows the groups trading book exposure to market price risk for the year ended 31st July, 2006: Highest Lowest Average Exposure exposure exposure exposure at 31st July 000 000 000 000 Equities: Long 64,636 41,245 50,200 49,623 Short 45,119 10,242 22,767 21,684 27,433 27,939 Debt securities: Long 89,422 40,511 60,099 67,066 Short 87,682 38,231 54,510 54,554 5,589 12,512 The following table shows the groups trading book exposure to market price risk for the year ended 31st July, 2005: Highest Lowest Average Exposure exposure exposure exposure at 31st July 000 000 000 000 Equities: Long 60,480 28,473 42,670 40,377 Short 33,634 10,905 20,541 20,424 22,129 19,953 Debt securities: Long 96,841 46,952 62,270 61,345 Short 88,064 37,781 58,572 49,628 3,698 11,717 The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
The basis on which the trading book is valued each day is given in the accounting policies in note 1 i.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 2,794,000 2005: 1,995,000 decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 1,251,000 2005: 1,172,000 decrease in the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly a jobbing business where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the result shown above is purely hypothetical.
