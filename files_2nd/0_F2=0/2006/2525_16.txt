78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies British Sky Broadcasting Group plc the Company is a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales, and domiciled in the United Kingdom UK.
The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group and its interests in associates and jointly-controlled entities.
a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS including International Accounting Standards IAS and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and its committees as adopted for use in the European Union EU, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations.
IFRS differs in certain material respects from United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP see note 32.
These are the Groups first annual consolidated financial statements since adopting IFRS, and the Group has elected 1 July 2004 as the date of transition to IFRS the Transition Date.
This transition date complies with the Securities and Exchange Commissions SECs decision to provide an exemption from the provision of a second year of comparative financial information for foreign registrants in the first year in which they adopt IFRS.
In subsequent years, the Group will produce two years of comparative financial information for SEC reporting purposes.
The following IFRSs have been adopted from the Transition Date, which is earlier than required under the IFRS transitional provisions: IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
b Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the remeasurement to fair value of financial instruments as described in the accounting policies below, and on a going concern basis.
The Group maintains a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest to 30 June in each year.
In fiscal year 2006 this date was 2 July 2006, this being a 52 week year fiscal year 2005: 3 July 2005, 53 week year.
For convenience purposes, the Group continues to date its financial statements as of 30 June 2006.
The Group has classified assets and liabilities as current when they are expected to be realised in, settled in, or intended for sale or consumption in, the normal operating cycle of the Group.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the date control of the subsidiaries commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Associates and joint ventures Associates are entities where the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of the entity.
Joint ventures are those entities which are jointly controlled by the Group under a contractual agreement with another party or parties.
These consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and joint ventures using the equity method, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences to the date that it ceases, based on the present ownership interests and excluding the possible exercise of potential voting rights, less any impairment losses see accounting policy k. When the Groups interest in an associate or joint venture has been reduced to nil because the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, the Group only provides for additional losses to the extent that it has incurred legal or constructive obligations to fund such losses, or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Where the disposal of an investment in an associate or joint venture is considered to be highly probable, the investment ceases to be equity accounted and, instead, is classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 79 1.
Accounting policies continued d Foreign currency translation The Groups functional currency and presentational currency is pounds sterling.
Trading activities denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in pounds sterling at the actual exchange rates as of the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and commitments denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to pounds sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the initial transaction.
Gains and losses from the retranslation of assets and liabilities are included net in profit for the year, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
The assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
Any exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups foreign exchange reserve.
e Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses a number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives are held at fair value from the date that a derivative contract is entered into.
Fair value is defined as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated with reference to the contracted value and the appropriate market value prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Certain derivatives held by the Group which relate to highly probable forecast transactions hedged items, that meet qualifying criteria under IAS 39, are designated as cash flow hedges, and are subject to cash flow hedge accounting.
Other derivatives held by the Group do not meet the qualifying criteria for recognition for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges, despite this being their economic function.
Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives solely for speculative purposes.
Derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges hedging instruments are initially recognised in the hedging reserve.
In circumstances where only the intrinsic value of a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, only the intrinsic value of the derivative is initially recognised in the hedging reserve, with all other movements being recognised in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in the hedging reserve are subsequently recognised in the income statement in the periods across which the related hedged items are recognised in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires, is terminated or is exercised, or if a hedge no longer meets the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the hedging reserve at that time remains in the hedging reserve and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement, provided that the underlying transaction is still expected to occur.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the hedging reserve is immediately recognised in the income statement and all future changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are immediately recognised in the income statement.
The ongoing effectiveness of the Groups cash flow hedges is assessed using the dollar-offset approach, with the expected cash flows of hedging instruments being compared to the expected cash flows of the hedged items.
This assessment is used to demonstrate that each hedge relationship has been highly effective in the period and is expected to continue to be highly effective in future periods.
The measurement of hedge ineffectiveness for the Groups hedging instruments is calculated using the hypothetical derivative method, with the fair values of the hedging instruments being compared to those of the hypothetical derivative that would result in the designated cash flow hedge achieving perfect hedge effectiveness.
The excess of the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual hedging instrument compared to that of the hypothetical derivative is deemed to be hedge ineffectiveness, which is recognised in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value from the inception of the host contract.
Changes in fair value are recognised within the income statement during the period in which they arise.
Goodwill Business combinations that have occurred since the Transition Date are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting.
Following this method, goodwill is initially recognised on consolidation, representing the difference between the fair value cost of the business 80 1.
Accounting policies continued combination and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
Where a business combination occurs in several stages, as a result of successive share purchases, the goodwill associated with each stage is calculated using fair value information at the date of each additional share purchase.
Any movement in the fair value of the Groups share of net assets held previously is recognised in a revaluation reserve.
In respect of business combinations that occurred prior to the Transition Date, goodwill has been included at its deemed cost, as permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
Deemed cost represents the goodwills carrying value under the Groups United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP accounting policies on the Transition Date.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to the Transition Date, which is not reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses and is tested, at least annually, for impairment, based on the recoverable amounts of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated.
Any impairment identified is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
The carrying amount of goodwill in respect of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture.
Intangible assets Research expenditure is recognised in the income statement as the expenditure is incurred.
Development expenditure relating to the application of research knowledge to plan or design new or substantially improved products for sale or use within the business is recognised as an intangible asset from the point at which it is probable that the Group has the intention and ability to generate future economic benefits from the development expenditure, that the development is technically feasible and that the subsequent expenditure can be measured reliably.
Any other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Other intangible assets, which are acquired by the Group separately or through a business combination, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, other than those that are classified as held for sale, which are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Amortisation of an intangible asset begins when the asset is available for use, and is charged to the income statement through operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets estimated useful life, principally being a period of no more than ten years, unless the asset life is judged to be indefinite.
If the useful life is indefinite or the asset is not yet available for use, no amortisation is charged and an impairment test is carried out at least annually.
Other intangible assets are tested for impairment in line with accounting policy k below.
g Property, plant and equipment PPE i.
Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses, see accounting policy k, other than those that are classified as held for sale, which are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
When an item of property, plant and equipment is comprised of major components having different useful economic lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets Assets held under finance leases, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are treated as property, plant and equipment see accounting policy p. iii.
Depreciation The cost of PPE, less estimated residual value, is depreciated in the income statement on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
Land, and assets that are not yet available for use, are not depreciated.
Principal useful economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Lower of lease term and the useful economic life of the asset Equipment, furniture and fixtures 3 to 10 years Assets under finance leases Lower of lease term and the useful economic life of the asset BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 81 1.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Acquired and commissioned television programme rights Programme rights are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value NRV, including, where applicable, estimated subscriber escalation payments, and net of the accumulated expense charged to the income statement to date.
Programme rights are recorded in inventories when the programmes are available for transmission.
Contractual obligations for television programme rights not yet available for transmission are not included in inventories and are instead disclosed as contractual commitments see note 26.
Payments made upon receipt of commissioned and acquired programming, but in advance of the legal right to broadcast the programmes, are treated as prepayments.
The cost of television programme rights is recognised in the operating expense line of the income statement, primarily as described below: Sports 100% of the cost is recognised in the income statement on the first showing or, where the rights are for multiple seasons or competitions, such rights are principally recognised on a straight-line basis across the seasons or competitions.
News 100% of the cost is recognised in the income statement on first showing.
General entertainment The cost is recognised in the income statement based on the expected profile of transmission.
Movies The cost is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of transmission rights.
Where programme rights are surplus to the Groups requirements, and no gain is anticipated through a disposal of the rights, or where the programming will not be broadcast for any other reason, a write-down to the income statement is made.
Any reversals of inventory writedowns are recognised as reductions in operating expense.
ii Digiboxes and related equipment Digiboxes including Sky boxes and High Definition boxes and related equipment are valued at the lower of cost and NRV, the latter of which reflects the value the business expects to realise from the digiboxes and the related equipment in the hands of the customer, and are recognised through the operating expenses line of the income statement.
Any subsidy is expensed on enablement, which is the process of activating the viewing card once inserted in the digibox upon installation, so as to enable a viewer to view encrypted broadcast services, and effectively represents the completion of the installation process for new subscribers.
The amount recognised in the income statement as the inventories are sold is recognised on a first-in first-out basis FIFO.
iii Raw materials, consumables and goods held for resale Raw materials, consumables and goods held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and NRV.
The cost of raw materials, consumables and goods held for resale is recognised through the operating expenses line of the income statement on a FIFO basis.
i Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence that any financial asset is impaired.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial asset or liability.
Financial assets are derecognised from the balance sheet when the Groups contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of the financial asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised from the Groups balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Equity investments Equity investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time are classified as available for sale investments.
They are carried at fair value, where this can be reliably measured, with movements in fair value recognised directly in reserves.
Where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is carried at cost.
Any impairment losses in equity investments are recognised in the income statement and are not reversible under any circumstances.
Available for sale investments are included within non-current assets unless management have the intention of holding the investment for less than twelve months from the balance sheet date, in which case they are included in current assets.
On disposal, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had previously been recognised directly in reserves is recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade and other receivables, with no stated interest rate, are measured at the original invoice amount if the effect of discounting is immaterial.
An allowance account is maintained to reduce the carrying value of trade and other receivables for impairment losses identified from objective evidence, with movements in the allowance account, either from increased impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses, being recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank accounts, deposits receivable on demand and deposits with maturity dates of 3 months or less from the date of inception.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents where offset conditions are met.
Short-term deposits This includes short-term deposits and commercial paper which have maturity dates of more than 3 months from inception.
These deposits are initially recognised at fair value, and then carried at amortised cost or fair value through the income statement less any allowance for impairment losses.
v. Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are non-derivative financial liabilities and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables, with no stated interest rate, are measured at the original invoice amount if the effect of discounting is immaterial.
Borrowings Borrowings are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including any premium payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the underlying instrument to which they relate, to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
j Transponder rental prepayments Payments made in respect of future satellite broadcast capacity have been recorded as prepaid transponder costs.
These payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.
k Impairment At each balance sheet date, and in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of all its assets excluding inventories see accounting policy h, non-current assets classified as held for sale, financial assets see accounting policy i and deferred taxation see accounting policy q to determine whether there is any indication that any of those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
An impairment, other than an impairment of an investment in a joint venture or associate, is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment of an investment in a joint venture or associate is recognised within the share of profit from joint ventures and associates.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price, defined as the fair value less costs to sell, and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to those units, and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss for an individual asset or cash generating unit shall be reversed if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised and is only reversed to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Any impairment loss in respect of goodwill is irreversible.
l Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to make a probable transfer of economic benefits as a result of past events.
The amounts recognised represent the Groups best estimate of the transfer of benefits that will be required to settle the obligation as of the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material using a market rate adjusted for risks specific to the liability.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 83 1.
Accounting policies continued m ESOP reserve Where the Company or its subsidiaries purchase the Companys own equity shares, the cost of those shares, including any attributable transaction costs, is presented within the ESOP reserve as a deduction in shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements.
n Revenue recognition Revenue, which excludes value added tax and transactions between Group companies, represents the gross inflow of economic benefit from Skys operating activities.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
The Groups main sources of revenue are recognised as follows: Revenue from the provision of direct-to-home DTH subscription services, including residential broadband services and revenue associated with sale of the customer magazine, is recognised as the goods or services are provided, net of any discount given.
Pay-per-view revenue is recognised when the event, movie or football match is viewed.
Cable revenue is recognised as the services are provided to the cable wholesalers and is based on the number of subscribers taking the Sky channels, as reported to the Group by the cable wholesalers, and the applicable rate card.
Advertising sales revenue is recognised when the advertising is broadcast.
Revenue generated from airtime sales where Sky acts as an agent on behalf of third parties is recognised on a net commission basis.
Betting and gaming revenues are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39.
Sky Bet revenues therefore represent income in the period for betting and gaming activities, defined as amounts staked by customers less betting payouts.
Sky Active revenues include income from online advertising, email, telephony income from the use of interactive services e. g. voting, interconnect, text services and digibox subsidy recovery revenues earned through conditional access and access control charges made to customers on the Sky digital platform.
All Sky Active revenues are recognised in the income statement when the goods or services are delivered.
Other revenue principally includes income from installations, digibox sales including the sales of Sky, Multiroom boxes and High Definition boxes, Sky Talk, service calls, warranties, customer management service fees, access control fees, SkyCard, Sky Mobile TV and the supply of broadband services to business customers.
Other revenues are recognised, net of any discount given, when the relevant goods or service are provided.
o Employee benefits Wages, salaries and social security contributions Wages, salaries, social security contributions, bonuses payable and non-monetary benefits for current employees, are recognised in the income statement as the employees services are rendered.
Pension obligations The Group provides pensions to eligible employees through defined contribution schemes.
The amount charged to the income statement in the year represents the cost of contributions payable by the Group to the schemes in exchange for employee services rendered in that year.
The assets of the schemes are held independently of the Group.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognised as a liability when, and only when, the Group has a demonstrable commitment to terminate the employment of an employee or group of employees before the normal retirement date or as the result of an offer to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Equity compensation benefits The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair values of these payments are measured at the dates of grant using optionpricing models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards are granted.
The fair value is recognised over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards, subject to the Groups estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based performance conditions not being met.
Where an award has market-based performance conditions, the fair value of the award is adjusted at the date of grant for the probability of achieving these via the option pricing model.
The total amount recognised in the income statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest, except where forfeiture is due to the failure to meet market-based performance measures.
In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1, and IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to options and awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
Accounting policies continued p Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessor Sublease income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The Group as lessee Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value on the date of acquisition, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reductions of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
The lease expense arising from operating leases is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
Benefits received and receivable as incentives to enter into operating leases are recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term.
q Taxation, including deferred taxation The Groups liability for current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Temporary differences arising from Goodwill and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit are not provided for.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect an amount that is probable to be realised based on the weight of all available evidence.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also included within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
r Dividends Dividends are recognised in the retained earnings reserve in the period in which they are declared or paid.
s Earnings per share Basic earnings per share represents the profit for the year, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held in the Groups ESOP during the year to satisfy employee share awards.
Diluted earnings per share represents the profit for the year, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held in the Groups ESOP Trust during the year to satisfy employee share awards, plus the weighted average number of dilutive shares resulting from share options and other potential ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
t Reportable segments A reportable segment, as defined by IAS 14 Segmental Reporting, is a distinguishable business or geographical component of the Group, that provides products or services, that are subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Group has no reportable segments within its business.

Accounting policies continued u Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective The Group has not yet adopted certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which have been published but are only mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2006, or later periods.
These new standards are listed below: Amendment to IAS 21 Net Investment in a Foreign Operation effective from 1 July 2006 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts effective from 1 July 2006 Amendment to IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions effective from 1 July 2006 Amendment to IAS 39 The Fair Value Option effective from 1 July 2006 IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease effective from 1 July 2006 IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds effective from 1 July 2006 IFRIC 6 Liabilities Arising from Participating in a Specific Market Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment effective from 1 July 2006 IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29 effective from 1 July 2006 IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 effective from 1 July 2006 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives effective from 1 July 2006 IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources effective from 1 July 2006 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures effective from 1 July 2007 and amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures effective from 1 July 2007 The Directors currently anticipate that the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group, other than additional disclosure requirements.
v Critical accounting policies and the use of judgement Certain accounting policies are considered to be critical to the Group.
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if its selection or application materially affects the Groups financial position or results.
The Directors are required to use their judgement in order to select and apply the Groups critical accounting policies.
Below is a summary of the Groups critical accounting policies and details of the key areas of judgement that are exercised in their application.
i Goodwill see note 11 Judgement is required in determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent assets assumed in a business combination.
Calculating the fair values involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including expectations about future cash flows, discount rates and the lives of assets following purchase.
Judgement is also required in evaluating whether any impairment loss has arisen against the carrying amount of goodwill.
This may require calculation of the recoverable amount of cash generating units to which the goodwill is associated.
Such a calculation may involve estimates of the net present value of future forecast cash flows and selecting an appropriate discount rate.
Alternatively, it may involve a calculation of the fair value less costs to sell of the applicable cash generating unit.
ii Revenue see note 2 Selecting the appropriate timing for, and amount of, revenue to be recognised requires judgement.
This may involve estimating the fair value of consideration before it is received and determining the stage of completion of a transaction at the balance sheet date.
Judgement is also required in evaluating the likelihood of collection of customer debt after revenue has been recognised.
This evaluation requires estimates to be made, including the level of provision to be made for amounts with uncertain recovery profiles.
Provisions are based on historical trends in the percentage of debts which are not recovered or on more detailed reviews of individually significant balances.
iii Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets see notes 12 and 13 The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected.
This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.
Accounting policies continued Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires judgement.
If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows forecast to be derived from the asset.
This forecast involves cash flow projections and selecting the appropriate discount rate.
Assessing whether assets meet the required criteria for initial capitalisation requires judgement.
This requires a determination of whether the assets will result in future benefits to the Group.
In particular, internally generated intangible assets must be assessed during the development phase to identify whether the Group has the ability and intention to complete the development successfully.
iv Programming inventory see note 17 The key area of judgement in respect of accounting for programming inventory is the assessment of the appropriate period over which to recognise the expense associated with the inventory in the income statement.
This assessment requires consideration of the period over which the Group will benefit from the programming inventory, which may not be certain on initial recognition of the inventory.
v Deferred tax see note 16 The key area of judgement in respect of deferred tax accounting is the assessment of the expected timing and manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date.
In particular, assessment is required of whether taxable profits are more likely than not to arise against which the deferred tax can be utilised.

These options do not currently have a dilutive effect as the exercise price of the options exceeds the average market price of ordinary shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the year into the weighted average number of shares for the year.
In order to provide a measure of underlying performance, management have chosen to present an adjusted profit for the year which excludes items that may distort comparability.
Such items arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but which management believes should be separately identified to help explain underlying performance.

Goodwill continued Goodwill, allocated by cash generating unit, breaks down as follows: 2006 2005 m m Interactive i 302 302 Betting and gaming ii 112 112 Broadcast iii 172 Broadband Enterprise iv 30 Multiple units without significant goodwill 7 3 623 417 Recoverable amounts for the Interactive, Betting and gaming and Broadband Enterprise cash generating units were calculated on the basis of value in use, using cash flows calculated for the next five years as forecast by management.
The recoverable amount for the Broadcast cash generating unit was calculated on the basis of its fair value less costs to sell.
i Interactive The interactive unit includes goodwill arising from the purchase of BiB.
The key assumptions on which these forecast five year cash flows were based included the number of interactive application providers on the interactive platform, the number of unique users of interactive services, the average spend per unique user, contractual rate cards, the number of customer connections to interactive services, and the level of conditional access and access control charges to broadcasters and interactive application providers on the Sky digital platform.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on historical data and trends within the unit, and on contractual rate cards, where these were available.
A growth rate of 3% was applied in order to extrapolate these cash flow projections beyond this five year period.
The cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.5%.
ii Betting and gaming The betting and gaming unit includes goodwill arising from the purchase of SIG.
The key assumptions on which these forecast five year cash flows were based include the number of weekly unique users, the number of bets placed per user per week, the average stake per user per week and the average spend per active user per week.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on an extrapolation of historical trends within the unit, and external information on expected future trends in betting and gaming.
iii Broadcast The broadcast unit includes goodwill arising from the purchase of Easynets UK broadband network assets and residential business.
The recoverable amount for the Broadcast cash generating unit was calculated on the basis of the difference between the quoted market value of the Company and the value in use of the Groups other cash generating units, less estimated costs to sell.
iv Broadband enterprise The broadband enterprise unit includes goodwill arising from the purchase of Easynets enterprise broadband business in the UK and other European countries.
The key assumptions on which these forecast five year cash flows were based include the number of enterprise customers, the average revenues per customer and the operating margin generated per customer.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on an extrapolation of historical trends within the unit, and external information on expected future trends in the enterprise broadband industry.

On 16 January 2002, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of the other half to fix the rate at 6.130% from 15 April 2002, payable semi-annually for the remainder of the life of the notes.
US$600 million of 6.875% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in February 2009.
At the time of issuing these notes, the US dollar proceeds were swapped into pounds sterling 367 million at an average fixed rate of 8.200%, payable semi-annually.
In July 2003, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of 61.2 million of this swapped debt.
The effect of this new hedging arrangement was that, from July 2003 until February 2009, the Group will pay floating six months London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR plus a margin of 3.490% on 61.2 million of its swapped debt.
However, at each six monthly reset date, the counterparty to this transaction has the right to cancel the transaction with immediate effect.
In October 2003, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of an additional 61.2 million of this swapped debt, the effect of which was to reduce the rate payable to 7.950% for the period August 2003 to February 2004.
Thereafter, until August 2006, the rate payable is 7.950% plus any margin by which the floating six monthly LIBOR reset rate exceeds the sum of the previous reset rate plus 0.500%.
Thereafter, the rate reverts to a fixed 8.180%.
In February 2005, the 7.950% interest rate on this swap was renegotiated to 8.020% with all other aspects of the swap remaining unchanged.
100 million of 7.750% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in July 2009.
The fixed coupon is payable annually.
US$650 million of 8.200% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in July 2009.
At the time of issuing these notes, the US dollar proceeds were swapped into pounds sterling 413 million at an average fixed rate of 7.653% payable semi-annually.
In December 2002 the Group entered into further swap arrangements relating to 63.5 million of this debt.
These arrangements were subsequently amended in March 2003 and July 2004, the effect of which was to fix the interest rate on 63.5 million at 5.990% until January 2004, after which time it reverted to a floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 2.460%, except that should LIBOR be less than 2.750% for the period January to July 2004, 2.890% for the period July 2004 to January 2005, or 2.990% thereafter, the effective rate shall be deemed to be 7.653%.
After July 2004, the margin over LIBOR increased from 2.460% to 2.840%.
In order to increase its exposure to floating rates, in July 2003, the Group entered into another interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of a further 63.5 million of the above-mentioned debt.
The effect of this arrangement was that, from July 2003 until July 2009, the Group will pay 102 21.
Borrowings and non-current other payables continued floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 2.8175% on this 63.5 million, except that should LIBOR be less than 2.750% for the period January to July 2004, or less than 2.990% thereafter, the Group shall revert back to 7.653%.
At 30 June 2006, none of the floor levels had been breached: therefore, the Group continues to pay the relevant floating rates.
US$750 million of 5.625% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in October 2015, which were issued in October 2005.
At the time of issuing these notes, the Group entered into swap transactions to convert the dollar proceeds to pounds sterling 428 million, which carry interest at an average fixed rate of 5.401% until maturity, payable semi-annually.
The Group entered into further interest rate hedging arrangements in respect of 257 million of this swapped debt.
The effect of these arrangements was that, from October 2005 until October 2015, the Group will pay an average floating rate of six months LIBOR plus a margin of 0.698% on 257 million of its swapped debt.
400 million of 5.750% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in October 2017, which were issued in October 2005.
On 14 June 2006, the Group entered into an interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of 20 million of debt.
The effect of this hedging arrangement is that, from October 2006 until October 2009, the Group will pay floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 0.325% on 20 million of its debt.
On the same date, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of 10 million of debt, to take effect from October 2009 and mature in October 2017.
Under the terms of this swap the Group will pay floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 0.325%.
However, at each annual reset date from October 2009 to October 2017, the counterparty to this transaction has the right to cancel the transaction with immediate effect.
US$350 million of 6.500% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in October 2035, which were issued in October 2005.
At the time of issuing these notes, the Group entered into swap transactions to convert the dollar proceeds to pounds sterling 200 million at an average fixed rate of 5.826%, payable semi-annually.

Borrowings and non-current other payables continued The main obligations under finance leases are in relation to the following: Financing arrangements in connection with the contact centre in Dunfermline.
During the year, repayments of 1 million 2005: 1 million were made against the lease.
A proportion of these payments have been allocated against the capital amount outstanding.
The lease bears interest at a rate of 8.5% and expires in September 2020. Financing arrangements in connection with the broadband network infrastructure purchased in the year through a business combination.
During the year, repayments of 7 million were made against the lease.
A proportion of these payments have been allocated against the capital outstanding.
The lease bears interest at a rate of 2.7% and expires in March 2040. iv Undrawn Revolving Credit Facility RCF In November 2004, the Company entered into a 1 billion RCF.
This facility was used to cancel an existing 600 million RCF and is available for general corporate purposes.
The 1 billion facility has a maturity date of July 2010, and interest accrues at a margin of between 0.45% and 0.55% above LIBOR, dependent on the Groups leverage ratio of Net Debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA as defined in the loan agreement.
The 1 billion RCF contains certain financial covenants which are tested at the end of each six-monthly accounting period.
The key financial covenants are the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as defined in the loan agreement and EBITDA to Net Interest Payable as defined in the loan agreement.
The Group must currently maintain these ratios as follows: Net Debt to EBITDA must be no more than 3:1 EBITDA to Net Interest Payable must be at least 3.5:1.
At 30 June 2006, the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as defined in the loan agreement was 0.8:1 2005: 0.4:1.
In the year ended 30 June 2006, the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest Payable as defined in the loan agreement was 11.2:1 2005: 15.8:1.
Commitment fees of 2 million 2005: 2 million were payable for undrawn amounts available under the RCFs, based on a rate equal to 40% of the applicable margin of 0.45% over LIBOR 30 June 2005: 40% of the applicable margin of 0.45% over LIBOR.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Set out below are the derivative financial instruments held by the Group to manage the interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.

On the same dates as these forward contracts were entered into, the Group entered into equal and opposite forward contracts with the respective joint ventures.
As a result, the net fair value of these contracts to the Group was nil 2005: nil.
The gross sterling equivalent face value of these forward contracts at 30 June 2006 was 7 million 2005: 11 million.
Group treasury activity The Groups treasury function is responsible for raising finance for the Groups operations, together with associated liquidity management, and the management of foreign exchange, interest rate and credit risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by both the Audit Committee and the Board, who receive regular updates of treasury activity.
Derivative instruments are transacted for risk management purposes only.
It is the Groups policy that all hedging is to cover known risks and that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Regular and frequent reporting to management is required for all transactions and exposures, and the internal control environment is subject to periodic review, both by the Groups internal audit team and by its Treasury Committee.
The Groups principal market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which arise both from the Groups sources of finance and from its operations.
Following evaluation of those market risks, the Group selectively enters into derivative financial instruments to manage these exposures.
The principal instruments currently used are interest rate swaps and options on interest rate swaps swaptions to hedge interest rate risks, forward exchange contracts, currency options collars and similar financial instruments to hedge transactional currency exposures, and cross-currency swaps to hedge exposures on long-term foreign currency debt.
Interest rate risk The Group has financial exposures to both UK and US interest rates, arising primarily from long-term bonds.
The Group manages its exposures by borrowing at fixed rates of interest and by using interest rate swap and swaption agreements to adjust the balance between fixed and floating rate BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 105 22.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued debt.
All of the Groups US dollar-denominated debt has been swapped to pounds sterling, using cross-currency swap arrangements, which, in addition to the translation of the principal amount of the debt to pounds sterling, also provide for the exchange, at regular intervals, of fixed-rate amounts of dollars for fixed-rate amounts of pounds sterling.
All of the Groups debt exposure is denominated in pounds sterling after crosscurrency swaps are taken into account.
At 30 June 2006, the split of the Groups aggregate net borrowings into their core currencies was US dollar 72% and pounds sterling 28% 2005: US dollar 91% and pounds sterling 9%.
The Group also enters into pounds sterling interest rate swap and swaption arrangements, which provide for the exchange, at specified intervals, of the difference between fixed rates and variable rates, calculated by reference to an agreed notional pounds sterling amount.
Certain of the swaption agreements can be cancelled prior to the maturity of the bonds, to which they apply see note 21 for further details.
The counterparties have a minimum long-term rating of A or equivalent with Moodys and Standard & Poors.
The Group has designated a number of cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges of 100% 2005: 100% of the Groups exposure to US dollar interest rates on US dollar denominated bonds.
As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the swaps designated and qualifying as cash flow hedging instruments is reported as a component of the hedging reserve, outside profit or loss, and is reclassified into profit or loss in the same periods during which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss i. e. when the interest expense is incurred and or gains or losses relating to the retranslation of US dollar denominated debt principal are recognised in the income statement.
Any hedge ineffectiveness on the swaps is recognised directly in profit or loss.
The ongoing effectiveness testing is performed using the dollar-offset approach.
If forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, any amounts included in the hedging reserve related to that forecast transaction are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Interest rate swap and swaption agreements which convert fixed interest rates to floating interest rates have not been designated as hedging instruments for hedge accounting purposes and as such movements in their values continue to be recorded directly in earnings.
The Groups hedging policy requires that between 50% and 75% of its borrowings are held at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swap and swaption agreements.
At 30 June 2006, 75% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps and swaption agreements 2005: 72%.
The fair value of interest rate swap and swaption agreements and cross-currency swaps held at 30 June 2006 was a 236 million net liability, compared to 103 million net liability at 30 June 2005.
At 30 June 2006, the Group had outstanding cross currency swap and interest rate swap and swaption agreements with net notional principal amounts totalling 1,596 million, compared to 1,018 million at 30 June 2005.
This movement reflects derivative financial instruments entered into in relation to bonds issued during the year, partly offset by the expiry of certain existing swap agreements.
In November 2004, the Group entered into a 1 billion RCF.
At 30 June 2006, the 1 billion facility was undrawn 30 June 2005: undrawn.
The 1 billion facility has a maturity date of July 2010, and interest accrues at a margin of between 0.45% and 0.55% above LIBOR, dependent on the Groups leverage ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as defined in the loan agreement.
The current applicable margin is 0.45% 2005: 0.45%, which is based on a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.00:1 or below.
Should this ratio increase above 1.00:1 and up to 2.00:1, the margin would increase to 0.50%, and above 2.00:1, the margin increases to 0.55%.
At 30 June 2006, the Group held 1,463 million 2005: 697 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits.
In order to manage interest rate risk on interest receivable, at 30 June 2005 forward rate agreements with a notional value of 53 million were entered into which fixed the interest rate receivable on sterling deposits for three months from 27 June 2005 at a rate of 5.060% and for three months from 26 September 2005 at a rate of 5.105%.
No forward rate agreements to manage interest rate risks on interest receivable are outstanding at 30 June 2006.
At 30 June 2006, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a 3 million decrease in the Groups annual net finance cost, defined as annual investment income less finance charges 2005: 3 million increase and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in a 3 million increase in the Groups annual net finance costs 2005: 2 million decrease generated by interest receivable and payable on bank accounts, bank loan, RCF and interest swap and swaption agreements.
At 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005, the Groups annual finance costs would be unaffected by any change to the Groups credit rating in either direction.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups revenues are substantially denominated in pounds sterling, although a significant proportion of operating costs are denominated in US dollars.
In the year 9% of operating costs 297 million were denominated in US dollars 2005: 12% 397 million.
These costs relate mainly to the Groups programming contracts with US suppliers.
During the year, the Group managed its currency exposure on US dollar denominated programming contracts by the purchase of forward exchange contracts and currency options collars and similar financial instruments for up to five years ahead.
All US dollar-denominated forward exchange contracts, currency options collars and similar financial instruments entered into by the Group are in respect of firm commitments only and those 106 22.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued instruments maturing over the year following 30 June 2006 represent approximately 80% 2005: 80% of US dollar denominated costs falling due in that year.
At 30 June 2006, the Group had outstanding commitments to purchase, in aggregate, US$626 million 2005: US$670 million at an average rate of US$1.81 to 1.00 2005: US$1.79 to 1.00.
In addition, currency option collars were held relating to the purchase of a total of US$336 million 2005: US$114 million.
The Group has designated a number of forward exchange contracts and currency options collars as cash flow hedges of up to approximately 80% 2005: 80% of the Groups exposure to US dollar payments on its programming contracts with US movie licensors for a period of five years, thereafter nil 2005: five years, thereafter nil.
As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of the hedging reserve, outside profit or loss, and is transferred to the income statement as the forecast transactions affect profit or loss i. e. when US dollar-denominated creditors are retranslated and related programming stock is amortised through the income statement.
For currency options collars, hedge accounting is only applied to changes in intrinsic value.
For forward exchange contracts, hedge accounting is applied to changes in the full fair value.
Any hedge ineffectiveness on the forward exchange contracts and currency options collars is recognised directly in the income statement.
If forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, any amounts included in the hedging reserve related to that forecast transaction would be recognised directly in the income statement.
Certain forward exchange contracts and currency options collars have not been designated as hedges and movements in their values continue to be recorded directly in the income statement.
The Groups primary euro exposure arises as a result of revenues generated from subscribers in Ireland.
Approximately 5% of total revenue in the year 2005: 3% was denominated in euros.
These euro-denominated revenues are offset to a certain extent by euro-denominated costs, relating primarily to certain transponder rentals, the net position being a euro surplus.
58 million euros were exchanged for US dollars on currency spot markets during the year 2005: 4 million euros and 51 million surplus euros were exchanged for pounds sterling 2005: nil.
At 30 June 2006, 55 million euros 37 million have been retained by the Group 2005: 82 million euros 56 million, to cover euro-denominated obligations falling due in the early part of the following year.
The Group purchased the programming rights to certain UEFA Champions League football matches until the end of the 2005 06 season.
Payments in respect of these rights were made pursuant to the contract in Swiss francs, which means that the Group was exposed to the Swiss franc:pound sterling exchange rate.
In line with the Groups policy of limiting foreign exchange transactions to fixed price instruments, all of the Swiss franc CHF 100 million was hedged during the year via the use of forward contracts.
It is the Groups policy that all anticipated foreign currency exposures are substantially hedged in advance of the fiscal year in which the exposure occurs.
The impact on the Groups annual profit of a 10% movement in pounds sterling against all currencies in which it has significant transactions is estimated to be a 1 million movement 2005: 8 million in the income statement, with a strengthening of pounds sterling resulting in a decrease in profits.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to default risk amounting to invested cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, and the positive fair value of derivatives held.
However, as financial transactions and instruments are only executed with counter parties that are all A long-term rating or better and the Groups policy is to ensure that investments are spread across a number of counterparties, these risks are deemed to be low.
Liquidity risk The Groups financial liabilities are shown in note 21, other than trade and other payables, shown in note 19, and provisions, shown in note 20.
To ensure continuity of funding, the Groups policy is to ensure that available funding matures over a period of years.
At 30 June 2006, 35% 2005: 49% of the Groups total available funding was due to mature in more than five years.
The Groups undrawn committed bank facilities, subject to covenants, were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Expiring in more than four years but not more than five years 1,000 Expiring in more than five years 1,000 BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 107 22.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of the book values and the estimated fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005: 2006 2005 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Financial assets and liabilities held or issued to finance the Groups operations Quoted bond debt 1,919 1,919 975 1,062 Derivative financial instruments 251 251 95 95 Obligations under finance leases and other borrowings 69 69 7 7 Short-term deposits 647 647 194 194 Cash and cash equivalents 816 816 503 503 The fair values of quoted bond debt are based on year-end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated by calculating the differences between the contracted rates and the appropriate market rates prevailing at the year-ends.
The fair values of other borrowings are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present value.
The fair values of short-term deposits and cash and cash equivalents are equivalent to book value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The differences between book values and fair values reflect unrealised gains or losses inherent in the financial instruments, based on valuations as at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be significantly different from the values reported above.
In addition to the financial assets and liabilities in the above fair value table, the Group had holdings in the equity share capital of other listed and unlisted entities at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005 see note 15.
The Group also had holdings in joint ventures and associates, which are accounted for using the equity method see note 14.
As these investments are unlisted their fair value cannot be measured reliably.
Additional information The estimated net amount of existing losses which are included in the hedging reserve at 30 June 2006 that are expected to be transferred to the income statement within the next twelve months is 7 million, net of tax 2005: 15 million, net of tax.
During the current year, the Group did not recognise any gains or losses in the income statement due to hedge ineffectiveness.
At 30 June 2006, the carrying value of financial assets that were, upon initial recognition, designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, was 148 million 2005: nil.
On 25 November 2005 the Group entered into a stock loan arrangement with a third party whereby the Group acquired a 100m basket of listed shares the Initial Purchase and, at the same time, the Group agreed to sell the basket of listed shares at the same price as the Initial Purchase on 25 November 2006.
During the period of share ownership, Sky is entitled to all rights of ownership associated with the shares.
The Group has recorded the stock loan arrangement as a short-term deposit at fair value with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.

v KCP awards All KCP awards outstanding at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005 vest only if performance conditions are met.
The contractual life of all KCP awards is ten years.
Designated managers participated in the KCP, which was a replica scheme of the LTIP, with the same performance conditions.
Awards exercised under the KCP can only be satisfied by the issue of shares purchased in the market.
vi EBP awards All EBP awards outstanding at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005 vest only if performance conditions are met.
The contractual life of these awards is ten years.
The EBP operated for Executive Directors and Senior Executives.
Awards under the plan were made in the form of a contingent right to acquire the Companys shares, for nil consideration, which are acquired in the market, and were subject to performance achieved in the financial year of award.
The movement in share awards outstanding is summarised in the following table: 2006 2006 2005 2005 Number of Weighted Number of Weighted shares average shares average under option exercise price under option exercise price Outstanding at 1 July 58,446,794 5.64 50,965,676 6.58 Granted during the year 8,390,285 0.80 19,636,399 3.57 Exercised during the year 4,160,336 3.85 1,938,116 6.05 Forfeited during the year 9,906,234 5.90 9,772,815 6.29 Expired during the year 2,776 4.85 444,350 6.05 Outstanding at 30 June 52,767,733 4.96 58,446,794 5.64 110 23.
Share capital continued The weighted average market price of the Groups shares at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 5.48 2005: 5.48.
The middle-market closing price of the Companys shares at 30 June 2006 was 5.735.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the 21,519,271 options which were exercisable at 30 June 2006 was 5.0 years, and their weighted average exercise price was 7.40.
Information for awards granted during the year The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year, as estimated at the date of grant, was 3.27 2005: 2.37.
This was calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model, except for awards which have market-based performance conditions, where a MonteCarlo simulation model was used, and for grants of nil-priced options, which were treated as the award of a free share.
The Monte-Carlo simulation model reflected the historical volatilities of the Companys share price and those of all other companies to which the Companys performance would be compared, over a period equal to the vesting period of the options.
The fair value of nil-priced options granted during the year was measured on the basis of the market-price of the Companys shares on the date of grant, discounted for expected dividends which would not be received over the vesting period of the options.
Weighted average fair value assumptions The following weighted average assumptions were used in these option pricing models: 2006 2005 Share price 5.13 4.93 Exercise price 0.80 3.57 Expected volatility 25.9% 41.5% Expected life 2.0 years 3.5 years Expected dividends 1.8% 1.0% Risk-free interest rate 4.3% 4.8% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price, over a period equal to the expected life of the options.
Expected life was based on the contractual life of the options, adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

This amount was equal to the Company-only profit and loss account reserve deficit at 30 June 2003.
As part of the application, the Companys balance sheet at 30 September 2003 was required to be presented.
At that date, the deficit on the Company-only profit and loss account reserve had reduced by 14 million since 30 June 2003, to 1,106 million.
As a condition of the reduction, the reduction in the share premium account of 1,120 million was permitted to be offset against the profit and loss account reserve by the amount of the deficit at 30 September 2003.
The excess of 14 million was credited to a special reserve, and, under the terms of the reduction, will remain undistributable until all the creditors of the Company and its guarantors as at 10 December 2003 are paid.
Purchase of own shares and capital redemption reserve On 12 November 2004, the Companys shareholders approved a resolution at the AGM for the Company to purchase up to 97 million ordinary shares.
On 4 November 2005, the Companys shareholders approved a resolution at the AGM for the Company to further purchase up to 92 million ordinary shares.
This authority to buy-back these shares expires on 3 November 2006.
Under the former resolution, during the year ended 30 June 2005, the Company purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 74 million ordinary shares at an average price of 5.60 per share, with a nominal value of 37 million, for a consideration of 416 million.
Consideration included stamp duty and commission of 3 million.
This represented 4% of called-up share capital at the beginning of the year.
During the financial year ended 30 June 2006, the Company purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 76 million ordinary shares at an average price of 5.30 per share, with a nominal value of 38 million, for a consideration of 408 million.
The nominal value of the shares cancelled has been credited to the capital redemption reserve.
This represents 4% of called-up share capital at the beginning of the financial year.
In July 2006, a further 2,902,173 shares were purchased and subsequently cancelled at an average price of 5.63 for a consideration of 16 million.
In addition, included within the total number of shares purchased in June 2006, are 3 million of the Companys ordinary shares, purchased by the Trustee of the ESOP.
These shares are held by the ESOP and will be used to satisfy the future exercise of share options and share awards by the Groups employees.
Reconciliation of shareholders equity continued The following table provides information about purchases of equity securities by the Company during the fiscal year.
ESOP reserve This reserve represents a deduction to Group equity for the cost of the Companys shares held by the Groups ESOP.
The movement in the ESOP reserve was as follows: Number of Ordinary Shares m At 1 July 2005 5,609,212 32 Share options exercised during the year 4,160,336 24 Shares repurchased by the Group for the ESOP during the year 3,000,000 17 At 30 June 2006 4,448,876 25 The 4,160,336 shares utilised during the year relate to the exercise of LTIP, EBP and KCP, Executive Share Option Schemes and Sharesave Scheme awards.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents amounts deducted from equity of 222 million 2005: 222 million relating to the acquisition of BiB and SIG, which will remain undistributable unless circumstances arise where either BiB or SIGs goodwill became impaired.
Under these circumstances, an amount equal to the impairment would be transferred to retained earnings.
The merger reserve was created in accordance with the merger relief provisions under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 as amended relating to accounting for business combinations involving the issue of shares at a premium.
Merger relief provided relief from the requirement to create a share premium account in a parent companys balance sheet.
In preparing group consolidated financial statements, the amount by which the fair value of the shares issued exceeded their nominal value was recorded within a merger reserve on consolidation, rather than in a share premium account.
Merger relief was available when three conditions had been satisfied: 1.
When a company secured at least 90 per cent of the nominal value of each class of the equity share capital of another company, as a result of an arrangement.
The arrangement provided for the allotment of equity shares by the acquirer.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 113 24.
Reconciliation of shareholders equity continued 3.
Consideration for the shares was either the issue or transfer of shares to the acquirer of equity shares in the purchased company, or the cancellation of those equity shares in the acquired company which the acquirer did not already hold.
The merger reserve was created as a result of the purchase by the Group of interests in two entities.
SIG was purchased on 12 July 2000, where consideration was paid by the issue of equity shares in the Group.
BiB was purchased between 28 June 2001 and 11 November 2002, where consideration was paid by the issue of equity shares in the Group.
Hedging reserve Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are initially recognised in the hedging reserve, and then recognised in the income statement when the related hedged items are recognised in the income statement.
In addition, deferred taxation relating to these derivatives is also initially recognised in the hedging reserve prior to transfer to the income statement.

This formed part of a corporate reorganisation, allowing the Company access to significant additional distributable reserves.

In addition, in the prior year, there were 45 million of commitments payable in Swiss francs and 3 million of commitments payable in Euros.
Assuming that movie subscriber numbers remain unchanged from current levels, an additional 363 million US$671 million of commitments 2005: 302 million, US$535 million would also be payable in US dollars, due to price escalator clauses.
The pound sterling television programme rights commitments include similar price escalation clauses that would result in additional commitments of 2 million 2005: 10 million if subscriber numbers were to remain at current levels.
ii The third party payment commitments are in respect of distribution agreements for the television channels owned and broadcast by third parties, retailed by the Group to DTH subscribers Sky Distributed Channels and are for periods up to five years 2005: four years.
The extent of the commitment is largely dependent upon the number of DTH subscribers to the relevant Sky Distributed Channels, and in certain cases, upon inflationary increases.
If both the DTH subscriber levels to these channels and the rate payable for each Sky Distributed Channel were to remain at current levels, the additional commitment would be 491 million 2005: 522 million.
iii Transponder capacity commitments are in respect of the Astra and Eurobird satellites that the Group uses for digital transmissions to both DTH subscribers and cable operators.
The commitments are for periods of up to fourteen years 2005: nine years.
Three additional transponder agreements were entered into in the year ended 30 June 2006 to provide capacity to facilitate the launch of the Groups HD services.
b Contingent liabilities The Group has contingent liabilities by virtue of its investments in joint ventures and associates that are unlimited companies, or partnerships, which include Nickelodeon UK, The History Channel UK, Paramount UK and National Geographic Channel UK.
The Groups share of contingent liabilities of its joint ventures and associates incurred jointly with the other investors is nil 2005: nil.
The Directors do not expect any material loss to arise from the above contingent liabilities.
c Contingent assets Under the terms of one of the Groups channel distribution agreements, British Sky Broadcasting Limited is entitled to a payment, expected to be received between July and December 2006, relating to a proportion of the fair market value of certain of the channels under that distribution agreement.
The fair market value of these channels has not yet been determined.
Accordingly, it is not yet possible to determine the value of the payment which may be received.
The Group has served a claim for a material amount against an information and technology solutions provider, which provided services to the Group as part of the Groups investment in customer management systems software and infrastructure.
The amount which may be recovered by the Group will not be finally determined until resolution of the claim.
d Guarantees The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have undertaken, in the normal course of business, to provide support to several of the Groups investments in both limited and unlimited companies and partnerships, to meet their liabilities as they fall due.
Several of these undertakings contain maximum financial limits.
These undertakings have been given for at least one year from the date of the signing of the UK statutory accounts of the related entity.
A payment under these undertakings would be required in the event of an investment being unable to pay its liabilities.
The Company has provided parental company guarantees of 14 million 2005: 14 million to creditors of Hestview Limited.
Letters of credit of BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 115 26.
Contracted commitments, contingencies and guarantees continued 5 million that British Sky Broadcasting Limited provided to Sky Interactive Limited in respect of Sky Buy expired during the year ended 30 June 2005 and were not replaced.
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed to provide additional funding to several of its investments in limited and unlimited companies and partnerships, in accordance with funding agreements.
Payment of this additional funding would be required if requested by the investees in accordance with the funding agreements.
The maximum potential amount of future payments which may be required to be made by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to its investments, in both limited and unlimited companies and partnerships under the undertakings and additional funding agreements, is 4 million 2005: 7 million.
Operating lease commitments The minimum lease rentals to be paid under non-cancellable operating leases at 30 June are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Within one year 28 26 Between one and two years 22 19 Between two and three years 18 15 Between three and four years 14 13 Between four and five years 13 11 After five years 49 45 144 129 The majority of operating leases relate to property.
The rents payable under these leases are subject to renegotiation at the various intervals specified in the leases.
The minimum sub-lease rentals to be received under non-cancellable operating sub-leases at 30 June are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Within one year 2 2 Between one and two years 2 2 Between two and three years 1 2 Between three and four years 1 1 Between four and five years 1 1 After five years 4 4 11 12 Sub-lease rentals relate to property leases.
Purchase of subsidiaries On 6 January 2006, the Group took control of Easynet Group Plc Easynet.
The Group has purchased 100% of the issued share capital for consideration of 223 million, satisfied in cash.
Easynet is the parent company of a group of companies involved in the provision of broadband networking services in the UK and other European countries.
The purchase of Easynet provides the Group with an opportunity to use and extend Easynets broadband network to offer residential broadband services to its customers.

Had the Group taken control of Easynet Group Plc on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue for the period would have been 4,228 million 2005: 3,992m, Group profit for the year would have been 535 million 2005: 562m and Group basic earnings per share would have been 29.3 pence 2005: 29.4 pence.
Goodwill includes the value that the Group is expecting to generate from its Sky Broadband products and services which utilise Easynets broadband infrastructure.
Goodwill has been determined provisionally because the Group cannot yet be certain that all assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have been identified.
Initial accounting for the goodwill will be complete within 12 months of the purchase date.
On 30 June 2006, the Group increased its shareholding in MKP from 49% to 100%, for consideration of 4 million, satisfied in cash.
Provisional goodwill of 4 million has been recognised as a result of this purchase.
Goodwill has been determined provisionally because of the short period of time between the purchase and publication of these consolidated financial statements.

Share-based payments i IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised a charge in the profit and loss account for its long-term incentive plans, based on the difference between the exercise price of the award and the price of a Sky share on the date of grant the intrinsic value.
No charge was recognised in respect of the Executive Share scheme, as the awards had an intrinsic value of nil, nor in respect of the Sharesave scheme due to a specific exemption under UK GAAP for such schemes.
Under IFRS 2, the Group is required to recognise a charge in the income statement for all share options and awards, based on the fair value of the awards as calculated at the grant date using an option-pricing model.
This IFRS method of valuations is applied in assessing the Income Statement charge for all share option schemes, including the Executive and Sharesave schemes.
The Group recognises a corresponding increase in shareholders equity in respect of this charge.
The effects of these two changes result in an additional charge to administration costs of 19 million and a reduction in taxation for the year of 6 million under IFRS compared to the charge under UK GAAP.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 121 31.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Financial instruments & hedge accounting Financial instruments and hedge accounting under IFRS resulted in an increase in profit before tax of 17 million and an additional tax charge of 6 million.
The breakdown of these adjustments is detailed below: ii IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Under UK GAAP, where the Group has taken out financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures, the rates inherent in the hedging contracts have been used to translate the hedged items.
IAS 21 requires the Group to record all foreign currency transactions at spot exchange rates at the transaction date, and to state all foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at closing exchange rates each balance sheet date.
The restatement of foreign currency creditors, programming additions and amortisation in the period resulted in a net charge of 22 million to programming costs.
The restatement of US$ debt and accrued interest in the period resulted in an additional charge to finance costs of 26 million.
Together, these adjustments resulted in a 14 million reduction in the taxation charge for the year.
iii IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement Under UK GAAP, the Group has recognised gains or losses on financial instruments on maturity.
Under IAS 39, the Group is required to recognise its derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value from inception of the contract, with changes in fair value being recognised in the income statement.
Where hedge accounting of cash flows is achieved, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument i. e. the change in fair value that is determined to be an effective hedge is initially recognised in equity in a hedging reserve, and is transferred to the Income Statement over the same period as the underlying hedged exposure affects the income statement.
This resulted in a reduction in programming costs of 34 million, and a reduction in finance costs of 31 million in respect of forward contracts and cross currency and interest rate swaps which achieved hedge accounting and an additional charge to taxation for the year of 20 million.
Under UK GAAP, the Group presented amounts receivable from betting and gaming customers on a gross basis.
Under IFRS, betting payouts are presented net against amounts receivable from betting and gaming customers.
This resulted in a 229m reduction in revenue, with a corresponding reduction in operating expense.
Goodwill iv IFRS 3 Business Combinations Under UK GAAP, the Group amortised goodwill on a straight-line basis over periods no longer than twenty years.
Under IFRS 3, the Groups goodwill balances which existed at the date of transition to IFRS are no longer amortised and instead are subject to annual impairment testing.
Therefore, the amortisation charge under UK GAAP for 2005 of 116 million has been reversed under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions which had been written off to reserves is recycled to the profit and loss account on disposal of the investment.
Under IFRS 3, such goodwill is not included in the gain or loss on disposal.
This results in a different gain or loss on disposal of investments under IFRS.
During the year, this difference gave rise to an adjustment of 32 million to reverse out goodwill recycled to the profit and loss account on the disposal of Granada Sky Broadcasting Limited GSB, so that the 23 million loss on disposal under UK GAAP became a gain on disposal of 9 million under IFRS.
Other adjustments v IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 38 requires development expenditure to be recognised in the balance sheet if it is probable it will provide future economic benefits to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Under IFRS, certain smartcard development expenditure arising in the year that was expensed under UK GAAP must be capitalised under these criteria.
This has resulted in an 11 million reduction in operating expenses and an additional charge to taxation for the year of 3 million.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued vi IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Investments in Joint Ventures Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for its share of joint ventures and associates using equity accounting.
Under IFRS, the Group continues to apply equity accounting.
However, under IFRS, the Group is required to cease recognising losses in equity accounted investments where our share of the loss exceeds our investment in the venture, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
In addition, the Groups share of joint ventures interest and taxation are reported through the share of joint ventures line.
Lastly, goodwill amortisation relating to joint ventures and associates has been reversed out under IFRS.
The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in Investment income of 1 million.
vii IAS 18 Revenue Under UK GAAP, revenues derived from the sale of surplus programming rights and magazine advertising were recognised net against operating expenses.
Under IFRS, this revenue has been recognised on a gross basis, resulting in a 23 million increase in revenue, offset by a 23 million increase in operating costs.
This treatment is consistent with the Groups US GAAP accounting policy for revenue.

Under IFRS, they are required to be recorded within reserves.
This resulted in a reclassification between accruals and reserves of 23 million in the Groups transitional balance sheet.
In addition, the requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes led to the recognition of 1 million of additional deferred tax assets relating to share-based payments.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Financial instruments & hedge accounting Financial instruments and hedge accounting under IFRS resulted in a decrease in total assets of 9 million, an increase in total liabilities of 5 million and a decrease in shareholders equity of 14 million.
The breakdown of these adjustments is detailed below: ii IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Under UK GAAP, where the Group has taken out financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures economically, the rates inherent in the hedging contracts have been used to translate the hedged items into GBP.
The restatement of foreign currency balances led to a decrease in programming creditors of 31 million, a decrease in programming inventory of 26 million, and a decrease in borrowings of 118 million.
These adjustments also led to a 37 million decrease in deferred tax assets.
iii IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Under IAS 39, the Group is required to recognise its derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value from inception of the contract, with changes in fair value being initially recognised in the hedging reserve or the income statement.
In the transitional balance sheet, this resulted in the recognition of additional assets of 2 million and additional liabilities of 43 million in respect of financial instruments used to hedge programming foreign currency exposures.
Additional assets of 9 million and liabilities of 111 million were recognised in respect of financial instruments used to hedge the Groups foreign currency debt exposure, and 1 million of additional assets relating to embedded derivatives.
These adjustments increased deferred tax assets by 42 million.
Other adjustments iv IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 38 requires certain expenditure, which was capitalised as tangible fixed assets under UK GAAP, to be capitalised as intangible assets under IFRS.
These assets include software that is not integral to a related item of hardware and software development.
The assets have been reclassified on transition to IFRS, and have continued to be amortised over their useful economic lives, which have not changed as a result of the reclassification.
This resulted in a reclassification between Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets of 155 million in the Groups transitional balance sheet.
v IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the Balance Sheet date, but before the date of signing the financial statements, are treated as adjusting post-balance sheet events, and the associated dividend payable has been recorded as a liability within the year-end balance sheet.
Under IAS 10 such a dividend is recorded as a liability in the accounting period in which it is approved.
This resulted in the removal of the final dividend of 63 million declared in August 2004 in respect of the year ended 30 June 2004 from the Groups transitional balance sheet.
vi IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements Under IAS 7, the definition of cash and cash equivalents normally includes investments with a short maturity less than three months from the date of acquisition, which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash with an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The definition of short-term deposits includes commercial paper and other term deposits with a maturity of more than three months from the date of acquisition.
This resulted in an IFRS reclassification in the transitional balance sheet from Short-term deposits to Cash and cash equivalents of 39 million for items with a maturity of less than three months at the date of acquisition.
vii IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Investments in Joint Ventures In accordance with the equity accounting requirements of IAS 28, the Groups accumulated share of losses in certain joint ventures that exceed its interest in those entities and its obligations to provide further funding are not recognised.
This resulted in an adjustment of 3 million in the transitional balance sheet for losses recognised under UK GAAP.
viii IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Under IAS 1, all deferred tax balances must be classified as non-current assets or liabilities, which has led to a reclassification of deferred tax assets previously classified within current assets under UK GAAP.

This resulted in a reclassification between accruals and reserves of 14 million 126 31.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued at 30 June 2005.
In addition, the requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes led to the recognition of 2 million of additional deferred tax assets relating to share-based payments.
Financial instruments & hedge accounting Financial instruments and hedge accounting under IFRS resulted in an increase in total assets of 10 million, an increase in total liabilities of 22 million and a decrease in shareholders equity of 12 million.
The restatement of foreign currency balances led to a decrease in programming creditors of 2 million, a decrease in programming inventory of 19 million, and a decrease in borrowings of 94 million.
These adjustments also led to a 23 million decrease in deferred tax assets.
iii IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement Under IAS 39, the Group is required to recognise its derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value from inception of the contract, with changes in fair value being recognised in the income statement.
In the Balance Sheet at 30 June 2005 this resulted in the recognition of additional assets of 13 million and additional liabilities of 6 million in respect of financial instruments used to hedge the Groups programming foreign currency exposures.
Additional assets of 9 million and liabilities of 112 million were recognised in respect of financial instruments used to hedge the Groups foreign currency debt exposure, and 1 million of additional assets relating to embedded derivatives.
These adjustments increased deferred tax assets by 29 million.
Goodwill iv IFRS 3 Business Combinations The adjustment of 116 million reinstates the goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP in the period, and is partly offset by an adjustment of 73 million in reserves, which reverses a release from the merger reserve to the Profit and Loss reserve made under UK GAAP in relation to the acquisitions on which the goodwill arose.
Other adjustments v IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 38 requires certain expenditure, which was capitalised as tangible fixed assets under UK GAAP, to be capitalised as intangible assets under IFRS.
This resulted in a reclassification between Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets of 191 million in the balance sheet.
IAS 38 requires development expenditure to be recognised in the balance sheet if it is probable that it will provide future economic benefits to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Under IFRS, certain development expenditure arising in the year meets these criteria and has therefore been capitalised.
Under UK GAAP the Group has elected to expense all such expenditure as incurred.
This results in an increase of 11 million in intangible assets in the balance sheet at 30 June 2005.
This adjustment decreases deferred tax assets by 3 million.
vi IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the balance sheet date, but before the date of signing the financial statements, are treated as adjusting post-balance sheet events, and the associated dividend payable has been recorded as a liability within the year-end balance sheet.
This resulted in the removal of the final dividend of 93 million declared in August 2005 in respect of the year ended 30 June 2005 from the Groups balance sheet.
vii IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements Under IAS 7, the definition of cash and cash equivalents normally includes investments with a short maturity less than three months from the date of acquisition, which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash with an insignificant risk of changes in value.
This resulted in an IFRS reclassification in the balance sheet from Cash and cash equivalents to Short-term deposits of 140 million for items with a maturity of more than three months at the date of acquisition.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued viii IAS 1 Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements Under IAS 1, all deferred tax balances must be classified as non-current assets or liabilities, which has led to a reclassification of deferred tax assets previously classified within current assets under UK GAAP.
In addition, 13 million of provisions, disclosed separately under UK GAAP, have been reclassified to current liabilities.

Investments with maturities of over three months have therefore been reclassified to Short-term deposits, resulting in a 224 million reduction in the effect of shortterm deposits on the movement in cash and cash equivalents.
ii IAS 38 Intangible Assets The Groups 81 million expenditure on software and development during the year has been reclassified from purchase of property, plant and equipment to purchase of intangible assets.
In addition, certain cash flows relating to smartcard development of 11 million have been reclassified from cash generated from operations to the purchase of intangible assets.

Summary of differences between IFRS and US GAAP i Differences giving rise to accounting adjustments The Groups accounts are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
The following is a summary of the significant adjustments to operating income, net income, shareholders equity and certain other balance sheet items required when reconciling such amounts recorded in the accounts to the corresponding amounts in accordance with US GAAP.
Year ended 30 June 2006 2005 m m Except per share data Operating income: Operating profit under IFRS 877 822 Adjustments: 2 Employee stock-based compensation 1 20 3 Derivative accounting 2 4 Capitalised interest 3 2 Operating income under US GAAP 873 840 Net income: Profit for the year under IFRS 551 578 Adjustments: 1 Goodwill 23 2 Employee stock-based compensation 1 20 3 Derivative accounting 8 2 4 Capitalised interest 4 11 5 Pre-consolidation results 2 6 Deferred taxation on US GAAP adjustments 5 7 Net income under US GAAP 551 577 8 Basic earnings per share under US GAAP 30.2p 30.2p 8 Diluted earnings per share under US GAAP 30.1p 30.1p 130 32.

Deemed cost represents the carrying value of the goodwill under the Groups UK GAAP accounting policies on the IFRS Transition Date.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses and is tested at least annually for impairment.
Under US GAAP, the Group adopted SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No.
As is the case under IFRS, SFAS No.
142 does not presume that goodwill is a wasting asset that should be amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life: instead, it must be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever indicators of impairment arise.
142, the Group ceased the amortisation of goodwill with a net carrying value of 1,084 million.
For US GAAP reporting purposes, the latest annual impairment test was completed during the current year.
The fair value measurements were compared to the carrying amounts of each reporting unit and it was determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Subsidiaries Sky Television Limited Goodwill of 492 million arising on the acquisition of Sky Television Limited on 3 November 1990 was being amortised under US GAAP on a straightline basis over 40 years.
From 1 July 2002, no further amortisation has been recorded under US GAAP following the adoption of SFAS No.
The goodwill balance under US GAAP at that date was 309 million.
Prior to the adoption of IFRS, under UK GAAP, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Sky Television Limited was eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP is not reinstated on transition to IFRS, as required by IFRS 1, leading to an increase in total assets under US GAAP compared to IFRS of 309 million.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 131 32.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US GAAP continued BiB The Group completed the acquisition of a 67.5% interest in BiB during fiscal 2001.
Under IFRS, the goodwill arising on the acquisition has been included at its deemed cost of 302 million, representing its carrying value under UK GAAP at the IFRS Transition Date.
Under US GAAP, the goodwill arising on acquisition was 664 million.
No amortisation has been charged from 1 July 2002 following the adoption of SFAS No.
The goodwill balance under US GAAP at that date was 560 million.
During fiscal 2003, under US GAAP, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of 24 million in respect of BiB tax losses carried forward.
The tax benefits of BiBs tax losses carried forward that were not recognised at the acquisition date of 21 million were applied to reduce goodwill relating to the acquisition.
This reduced the goodwill balance under US GAAP to 539 million, resulting in a goodwill balance which is currently 237 million higher than that under IFRS.
SIG The Group completed the acquisition of SIG on 12 July 2000.
Under IFRS, the goodwill arising on the acquisition has been included at its deemed cost at the IFRS Transition Date of 112 million.
Under US GAAP, goodwill of 272 million was being amortised on a straight-line basis over seven years.
From 1 July 2002, no further amortisation has been recorded following the adoption of SFAS No.
The goodwill balance under US GAAP at that date was 189 million.
During fiscal 2003, under US GAAP, the Group recorded an impairment charge of 5 million against goodwill which arose on the acquisition of BSkyB Sports Holdings Limited formerly Opta Index Limited, a subsidiary of SIG.
This reduced the goodwill balance under US GAAP to 184 million, resulting in a goodwill balance which is currently 72 million higher than that under IFRS.
In addition, there is 3 million of goodwill under IFRS, which has a carrying value of nil under US GAAP, which has arisen on certain other acquisitions.
Joint ventures On 1 November 2004, the Group sold its 49.5% investment in GSB, realising a profit on disposal under IFRS of 9 million.
This was included as an item below operating profit.
Prior to the adoption of IFRS, under UK GAAP, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of an additional 9.5% interest in GSB in March 1998 was eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP is not included in determining any subsequent gain or loss on disposal under IFRS, as required by IFRS 1.
Under US GAAP, the carrying value of the goodwill at the time of the disposal was 23 million, which resulted in a loss on disposal of 14 million.
Under US GAAP, 1 million of goodwill has arisen on the purchase of certain other joint ventures and associates.
No amortisation charge is being recognised.
Under IFRS, the deemed cost of this goodwill at the IFRS Transition Date was nil.
2 Employee stock-based compensation Under IFRS, the Group recognises an expense for all share options and awards based on fair values, measured at the date of grant using appropriate option-pricing models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards are granted.
The expense is recognised over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards, adjusted for the Groups estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either due to employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based performance conditions not being met.
Under US GAAP, prior to 1 July 2005, the Group accounted for the cost of options and awards in accordance with APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No.
For performance-related options deemed to be variable plans under APB No.
25, compensation expense was measured as the difference between the quoted market price and the exercise price at the date when the number of shares that would vest and the exercise price was known the measurement date : the cost was recognised over the period the employee performed the related services.
Since the ultimate compensation was unknown until the performance conditions were satisfied, estimates of compensation expense were recorded before the measurement date based on the quoted market price of the common shares at the intervening dates, in situations where it was probable that the performance conditions would be attained.
Options that vested conditional only on continued employment over the life of the options were deemed to be fixed plans under APB No.
25, with the excess of the market price over the exercise price on the date of grant being charged against income over the vesting period of the options.
Under US GAAP, following the adoption of SFAS No.
123 revised 2004 Share-Based Payment SFAS No.
123R, from 1 July 2005, the accounting for share options and awards has changed.
123R requires the recognition of an expense for all share options and awards granted to employees, based on the fair value at the grant date of those awards, as estimated using appropriate option-pricing models.
Under IFRS, in accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, an expense has only been recognised in respect of options and awards granted after 7 November 2002, that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
123R using the modified prospective application transition method and was therefore required to recognise an expense in respect of the 132 32.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US GAAP continued portion of any requisite vesting period which had not been completed for all options and awards at 1 July 2005, regardless of the original date of grant of those awards.
Furthermore, under IFRS, the Group is required to recognise compensation cost for awards with graded vesting on an accelerated basis, as though each separately vesting portion of the award is a separate award.
Under US GAAP, the Group is required to recognise compensation cost under SFAS No.
123R using the attribution method that was used under SFAS No.
123 Accounting for Stock-based Compensation SFAS No.
123, the Group recognised compensation cost for such awards using a straight-line method, and is therefore required to continue to follow that same recognition method for the unvested portion of these awards after adopting SFAS No.
The extra US GAAP charge for the year in respect of these differences amounts to 1 million, as the charge recognised was greater than that recognised during the year under IFRS.
The total tax benefit recognised under US GAAP relating to stock-based compensation was 8 million and the tax benefit recognised in respect of options exercised during the year was 3 million.
As the Group adopted SFAS No.
123R using the modified prospective application transition method, prior periods have not been restated.
The effect of adopting SFAS No.
123R was to reduce income before taxation for the year ended 30 June 2006 by 10 million, compared to that which would have arisen if share options and awards had been accounted for in accordance with APB No.
25, to reduce net income for the year by 5 million, and to reduce basic and diluted earnings per share by 0.3 pence.
Had compensation expense for share options been determined in accordance with SFAS No.
123 for periods prior to 1 July 2005, the Groups net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro-forma amounts shown below: Year ended 30 June 2005 m Net income under US GAAP: As reported 577 Add: APB No.
25 stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income 5 Related tax effects 1 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards 31 Related tax effects 9 Pro-forma 559 Earnings per share under US GAAP: Basic as reported 30.2p Basic pro-forma 29.3p Diluted as reported 30.1p Diluted pro-forma 29.2p Under IFRS, employers National Insurance is accrued over the vesting period of the share options.
Under US GAAP, EITF 00-16 Recognition and Measurement of Employer Payroll Taxes on Employee Stock-Based Compensation requires the accrual for National Insurance to be recognised on the date of the event triggering the measurement and payment of tax to the tax authority i. e. the exercise date of the share options.
The additional US GAAP credit arising for the year amounts to 2 million 2005: 1 million, as the National Insurance paid was less than that accrued during the year under IFRS.
The cumulative balance sheet effect of this adjustment at 30 June 2006 was a decrease in the accrual under IFRS for employers National Insurance of 7 million 2005: 5 million.
3 Derivative accounting Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the Group is required to recognise its derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value from inception of the contract, with changes in fair value being recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of derivative instruments is determined based on discounted present value techniques.
Under US GAAP, a number of the Groups cross-currency swaps which convert fixed US dollar interest payments into fixed sterling interest payments were not designated as cash flow hedges until after their inception.
Accordingly, the fair value of these swaps at the date of designation results in hedge ineffectiveness, which is recorded directly in the income statement.
Under IFRS, as permitted by the IFRS 1 transition rules, there is no ineffectiveness arising, as hedge accounting is deemed to have been achieved from their inception.
The estimated net amount of existing losses which are included in other comprehensive income OCI at 30 June 2006 that are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is 11 million, net of tax 2005: 20 million.
During the current year, the Group recognised a loss in the income statement of 6 million due to hedge ineffectiveness 2005: 5 million.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 133 32.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US GAAP continued 4 Capitalised interest Under IFRS, the capitalisation of interest is not required, and the Group expenses interest charges to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Under US GAAP, interest charges on funds invested in the construction of major capital assets are required to be capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the assets concerned.
Cumulative capitalised interest on assets under construction net of amortisation at 30 June 2006 amounted to 24 million 2005: 20 million.
During the year, interest of 7 million 2005: 13 million was capitalised in respect of assets under construction, and amortisation of 3 million 2005: 2 million was charged in respect of capitalised interest on assets in use.
5 Pre-consolidation results On 21 October 2005, the Group made a recommended cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Easynet.
On 6 January 2006, the offer was declared unconditional in all respects, and this is considered to be the acquisition date.
Under IFRS, the Groups ownership interest in Easynet shares up until the date of acquisition were treated as an available for sale investment.
Under US GAAP, the Group has applied the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
18 The equity method of accounting for investments in common stock, which require that when an investment previously accounted for using other than the equity method becomes qualified for consolidation, an investors retained earnings and results of operations should be adjusted retrospectively to adopt the equity method for its ownership interest in previous periods.
Accordingly, under US GAAP, the Groups share of Easynets net loss for the period to 6 January 2006 of 2 million has been included within net income.
6 Deferred taxation Under IFRS, IAS 12 Income taxes IAS 12 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax bases.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
109 Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS No.
109 requires that deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax bases.
A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realised.
The net deferred tax asset recognised under IFRS and US GAAP primarily differs in respect of deferred tax on IFRS to US GAAP adjustments.
A further difference arises in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of employee stock-based compensation expense.
Under IFRS, the deferred tax asset is based on the compensation expense recognised in the income statement, but is adjusted to reflect the Groups estimate of the actual future tax deduction which will arise, based on the Groups share price at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, the deferred tax asset is also based on the compensation expense recognised in the income statement, however SFAS No.
123R requires that no consideration is given to the Groups share price at the balance sheet date in either measuring the gross asset or any valuation allowance required.
Under IFRS, at 30 June 2006, there is a deferred tax asset of 100 million 2005: 105 million.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US GAAP continued The net deferred tax asset under US GAAP comprises the following: Deferred tax asset Deferred tax asset 30 June 2006 30 June 2005 Gross Valuation Net Gross Valuation Net iv iv asset allowance Asset asset allowance asset m m m m m m Accelerated capital allowances 45 19 26 30 16 14 i Tax losses carried forward 277 244 33 146 78 68 ii Fixed asset investments 354 354 354 354 Short-term timing differences 22 44 Share-based payment timing differences 12 12 77 iii Financial instrument timing differences 43 43 29 29 Foreign exchange timing differences 21 21 23 23 Other 4 4 4 4 708 617 91 543 448 95 i At 30 June 2006, there is a valuation allowance of 169 million 2005: 64 million against a deferred tax asset in respect of overseas trading losses, including 64 million 2005: 64 million with respect to the Groups German holding companies of KirchPayTV, on the basis that these temporary differences are not more likely than not to be realised.
There is also a valuation allowance of 75 million 2005: 14 million against a deferred tax asset arising from UK losses in the Group.
The losses are available to be carried forward indefinitely under current law.
Under US GAAP, the subsequent recognition of tax benefits relating to the deferred tax asset of 75 million 2005: 14 million arising from UK losses in the Group will be allocated to reduce goodwill, then intangible assets arising on previously acquired entities.
ii At 30 June 2006, there is a valuation allowance of 330 million 2005: 330 million against a deferred tax asset in respect of potential capital losses related to the Groups holding of KirchPayTV on the basis that these temporary differences are not more likely than not to be realised.
There is also a valuation allowance of 24 million 2005: 24 million against a deferred tax asset in respect of realised and unrealised capital losses in respect of football club and other investments, on the basis that it is more likely than not that they will not be realised.
iii During the current year, the deferred tax asset relating to financial instruments increased by 14 million 2005: increased by 3 million through OCI.
iv The current period charge to the income statement in respect of these valuation allowances was 3 million 2005: credit of 3 million.
The US GAAP tax charge, which relates wholly to UK corporation tax on continuing operations, comprises: Year ended 30 June 2006 2005 % % UK corporation tax rate 30.0 30.0 Permanent differences 1.7 0.2 Loss on disposals of investments, net 0.5 Joint venture profits 0.2 0.1 Valuation allowance 0.4 0.2 Credits relating to prior periods 0.8 3.1 Other 0.6 0.1 US GAAP income tax charge 30.5 27.2 7 Debt issue costs Under IFRS, borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
21 Interest on Receivables and Payables, which require that direct issue costs should be reported in the balance sheet as deferred charges, within assets.

ii Additional US GAAP Disclosures a Adoption of new standards SFAS No.
154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFAS No.
This standard replaces APB Opinion No.
20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No.
3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim financial statements.
154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.
The standard is effective for financial statements with fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2005 and will therefore be adopted by the Group from 1 July 2006.
154 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group results of operations or its financial position.
155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments SFAS No.
This standard simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments, eliminates certain interim guidance relating to securitised financial assets, and eliminates certain restrictions on qualifying special-purpose entities.
The standard is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in any fiscal year beginning after 15 September 2006, and will therefore be adopted by the Group from 1 July 2007.
155 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group results of operations or its financial position.
156 Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.

156 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group results of operations or its financial position.
48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.
The evaluation of a tax position under FIN 48 is a two-step process.
The first step is recognition: tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return should be recognised only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold, it should be presumed that the position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
The second step is measurement: tax positions that meet the recognition criteria are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being recognised upon ultimate settlement.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US GAAP continued FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2006 and is therefore effective for the Group from 1 July 2007.
The Group is currently assessing FIN 48 and has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of this interpretation will have on its financial position or results of operations.
