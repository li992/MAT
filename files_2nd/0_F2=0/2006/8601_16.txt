For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any gain or loss on the sale of properties, impairment of goodwill, financing fair value movements and one off items that are material and infrequent in nature.
In the current financial year, these one off items were the Business Review costs, IT insourcing costs and debt restructuring costs.
In the prior financial year, these one off items were the Business Review and Transformation costs.

The financial liabilities on which no interest is paid do not have predetermined dates of payment and therefore a weighted average period of maturity cannot be calculated.
Onerous leases are considered to be a floating rate financial liability as, in establishing the provision, the cash flows have been discounted.
The discount rate is reappraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The above analysis excludes a cancellable swap in a notional principal amount of 150 million under which the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.09 per cent and receives floating rate LIBOR.
The counterparty may exercise an option to cancel the swap on quarterly dates through to August 2030.
Currency exposures After taking into account forward contracts the Group had net euro denominated monetary assets of 36 million, US dollar denominated monetary assets of 33 million and Australian dollar monetary assets of 1 million.
The Group has net euro denominated trade creditors of 8 million and Australian dollar denominated trade creditors of 1 million.
Sainsburys Bank is not exposed to currency risk at 26 March 2005 and does not have any assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling so no currency risk arises.

The defined benefit schemes were closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Groups assets.
The defined benefit schemes were subject to a triennial valuation carried out by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries, at March 2003, on the projected unit basis.
The results of this valuation have been used to determine the current employer and employee contribution rates respectively.
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one off cash payment.
In the current financial year, the Group utilised funds obtained from the new long-term financing note 21 to make an additional one off contribution of 350 million into the pension schemes which, together with additional annual contributions, are designed to fund the reported deficit of the pension schemes as at 8 October 2005.

This is an approved Inland Revenue Scheme and was established in 1980.
Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares of the Company at a stated exercise price.
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.

J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Share-based payments continued b Executive Share Option Plan ESOP Under the Executive Share Option Plan, participants were granted options to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
The maximum annual option award is two times basic salary and the actual grants were agreed by the Remuneration Committee according to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS relative to inflation over a threeyear period.
The Committee reviews the performance condition prior to the annual award of options to ensure that it is set at appropriately challenging levels.
EPS is measured against a fixed starting point over the performance period beginning with the year in which the option was granted.
For the ESOP grants made in the prior financial year, the performance conditions provided that no options will vest for average annual real growth of less than three per cent per annum over the three-year performance period, 50 per cent of the option will vest if average real growth of three per cent per annum is achieved and for average real growth of five per cent per annum, the option is exercisable in full, with a pro rating between three and five per cent.
To the extent that the condition is not satisfied in full after three years, it will be retested on a fixed point basis over four and then five financial years.
To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Once the options vest, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to exercise the options between vesting date normally at the end of the three-year performance period and the option expiry date, which is ten years from date of grant.
It is intended that there will be no further options granted under this plan.

Under the CSOP, participants are granted options to purchase shares of the Company at a stated exercise price.
The exercise of options is conditional upon participants remaining in the employment of the Group for a three-year period after date of grant.
Colleagues leaving employment for certain reasons have six months from their leaving date to exercise their options.
At 25 March 2006, a total of 54,817 UK employees 2005: 62,679 participated in the plan and hold options over 18.6 million shares 2005: 21.9 million.

Under the PSP, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to receive a grant of options after a performance period of three years to purchase the shares awarded to them for the sum of 1, at any time during the ten years following the date of grant.
The participants entitlement to receive the grant depends on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR being the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, compared with a peer group of 12 companies namely Ahold, Boots, Carrefour, Casino, Dixons, GUS, Kingfisher, Loblaw, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Next and Tesco, over the three-year performance period.
If the median performance of the TSR against the comparator group is not achieved at the end of the three-year performance period, the entitlement to receive the grant of options will lapse.
At median level, shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary will be released and the award will be pro rated at every position between the median and first position in the comparator group.
The maximum allocation for Directors is a conditional grant of shares equal to 75 per cent of salary.
No further allocations will be made under this plan.

J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 85 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Share-based payments continued e J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005 A long-term incentive plan was introduced in March 2005 as a one off, self funded incentive arrangement focused on rewarding those responsible for leading and implementing the Companys recovery plan.
The underlying principle of the plan is to reward delivery of strong growth in sales and profitability, covering a four-year period.
Under the plan, shares were awarded to participants on the conditional basis that the performance targets are achieved within the four-year performance period.
The levels of awards are scaled according to seniority and there is an opportunity for Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members to make a personal investment of up to 50 per cent of salary in the plan.
Performance is measured over a four-year period from the financial year beginning 27 March 2005 until the financial year ending March 2009.
The awards will vest if stretching sales and earnings per share EPS targets are achieved, as shown in table 1 below.
The relevant performance multiplier, which is on a sliding scale up to a maximum of five times, will be calculated and applied to the core award of shares, as well as the personal investment of shares i. e. shares acquired by Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members.
The total award released will include the personal investment shares acquired by the participant.
The maximum award will be targeted towards sales growth of 2.5 billion, and requires compound annual growth in EPS of at least 21 per cent over the four years.
Sales inc VAT exclude Sainsburys Bank and petrol sales.
Further, there is an opportunity for partial vesting of up to half the award, if the accelerated performance targets have been met at the end of year three i. e. financial year ending March 2008 see table 2.
No awards will vest unless threshold levels of growth in both sales and EPS are achieved.
Once performance targets have been achieved, options will be granted to participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons to acquire the shares awarded to them, at nil cost.
These options will expire within a year after the end of the four-year performance period, i. e. in March 2010.
Dividends will accrue on any shares which vest and will be released to participants in the form of additional shares at the point of vesting.
On 24 March 2005, the Remuneration Committee made conditional awards over 32.5 million shares assuming maximum performance multiplier to over 1,000 participants in the plan, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
The J Sainsbury plc Share Plan was approved by shareholders on 13 July 2005.

The free shares are being held in a trust on behalf of participants and will be forfeited if participants cease to remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years.
Shares are released to participants within the first three years for certain reasons.
After the three-year period, the shares continue to be held by the trust for a further holding period of two years, unless they are released to participants upon cessation of employment with the Group.

40 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments Contingent liabilities Operating lease commitments note 38 include payments in respect of 26 supermarket properties sold 16 supermarket properties sold in March 2000 for 325 million and ten supermarket properties sold in July 2000 for 226 million and leased back to Sainsburys Supermarkets for a period of 23 years.
Under the arrangement, the Company has provided a residual value guarantee of 170 million for the 16 supermarket properties and 39 million for the ten supermarket properties at the end of the lease period.
In view of the relatively low amount of the guarantees when compared to the present market value of the freehold interests, the Directors believe that the likelihood of the guarantees being invoked is remote, therefore no provision has been recognised in these financial statements.
Financial commitments The Group is committed to make the second tranche payment of 240 million in relation to the additional one off contribution to the defined benefit pension schemes on 19 May 2006 note 32.
Sainsburys Bank The amounts noted below indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date in respect of undrawn commitments to lend on credit cards, mortgages and personal loans.
They do not reflect the underlying credit or other risks which amounted to 9 million 2005: 11 million as indicated by the risk-weighted amount using the Financial Services Authoritys capital adequacy requirement.

In addition, the net pension deficit of 30 million relating to Shaws has been transferred as part of the sale of Shaws with the effect of increasing the reported gain on sale.
This is recorded as an increase in the Profit attributable to discontinued operations in the income statement for the 52 weeks to 26 March 2005.

Under IFRS, investments in foreign subsidiaries are held at historical cost and exchange differences arising on translation of foreign currency borrowings are taken to the income statement in the individual financial statements of the Company.
The impact of this change in treatment is to increase investments by 37 million in the balance sheet at 26 March 2005 and increase profit after tax of 4 million in the income statement for the 52 weeks to 26 March 2005.
In addition, there has been a change in presentation of investments, as a result of which advances to subsidiaries are no longer presented as part of investments, but classified as receivables under IFRS.
There is no impact on net assets in the balance sheets at 28 March 2004 and 26 March 2005 from this change in presentation.
b Own shares held by ESOP trusts Under UK GAAP, the assets and liabilities of the ESOP trusts were aggregated with the assets and liabilities of the Company, as the Company is the sponsoring entity of the trusts.
Under IFRS, the ESOP trusts are only consolidated at the Group level, and would not be aggregated within the Companys individual financial statements.
Thus, the own shares held by the ESOP trusts are not deducted from the Companys equity.
The impact of this change in treatment is to increase net assets by 86 million and 85 million in the balance sheets at 28 March 2004 and 26 March 2005 respectively.
c Dividend income Under IFRS, the Company recognises dividend income from its subsidiaries only when the dividend has been declared.
Accordingly, dividend receivable of 312 million and 250 million are reversed in the balance sheets at 28 March 2004 and 26 March 2005 respectively.
The impact on the income statement for the 52 weeks to 26 March 2005 is to increase profit after tax by 62 million.
d Dividends IFRS requires that dividends be recognised as a liability when they are declared i. e. approved by shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, when paid.
Accordingly, the accrued final dividends of 218 million and 95 million are reversed in the balance sheets at 28 March 2004 and 26 March 2005 respectively.
The final dividend of 218 million is recognised directly as an appropriation of retained earnings in the balance sheet at 26 March 2005.
Explanation of material adjustments to the Group and Company cash flow statements Income taxes and interest paid are classified as part of operating cash flows under IFRS, but were included in separate categories under UK GAAP.
Equity dividends paid are classified as part of financing cash flows under IFRS, but were shown as a separate line item under UK GAAP.

Where the instruments are part of a qualifying hedge relationship the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that reflects the designated hedged risk.
The Group and Company choose not to hedge account for certain interest rate and cross currency swaps.
In these cases the difference between the previously reported carrying value and the fair value of the derivative financial instrument has been recognised directly in opening retained earnings.
The difference between the previously reported carrying value and the fair value of the hedged item that reflects the designated hedged risk has also been recognised directly in opening retained earnings and will be fully amortised through the income statement by maturity.
A portion of the Groups and Companys interest rate swaps do not qualify as hedging instruments under IAS 39.
At the date of transition the difference between the previously reported carrying value and the fair value of these swaps was 23 million 16 million after deferred tax and has been recognised directly in opening retained earnings.
Movements in the fair value of these instruments are recognised in the income statement.
In addition, on adoption of IAS 39, an available-for-sale financial asset of 85 million relating to the Groups beneficial interest in a property investment pool has been recognised, with the corresponding credit made to reserves.
This asset will be held at fair value with any fair value movements taken to reserves.
The majority of the Groups bank accounts are pooled in an offset arrangement for the purpose of charging interest.
Under IAS 32 financial assets and financial liabilities must be separately disclosed.
The effect of grossing up the Group bank accounts at 27 March 2005 is to increase overdrafts and cash at bank by 103 million.
Under IAS 32, the Company must present the B shares, which have previously been included as part of equity, as a current liability.
Dividends paid on the B shares are recognised in the income statement as part of finance costs.
The carrying value of the B share capital at 27 March 2005 was 133 million.
