Responsibility of Directors for the preparation of the directors report and the accounts The directors are responsible for preparing the directors report and the accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company accounts for each financial year.
Under that law the directors have elected to prepare both the group and the parent company accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
The group and parent company accounts are required by law and IFRS as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the group and parent company and the performance for that period: the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such accounts that references in the relevant part of that Act to accounts giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the group and parent company accounts, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently: make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU: and prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
