FORTY-SIX The Expro Group Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts Year ended 31 March 2006 1.
General information Expro International Group PLC the group is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985 and is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and within the directors report.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the group had not adopted the amendment to IAS 39 relating to cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of this amendment, the group will not adopt this standard until 1 April 2006.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of this amendment will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group.
In addition, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the Companies Act 1985 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The group adopted IFRS with a transition date of 1 April 2004, with the exception of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which have been applied prospectively from 1 April 2005.
The figures for the year ended 31 March 2005 which were previously reported in accordance with UK GAAP have been restated to comply with IFRS.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS allows certain exemptions from the retrospective application of IFRS prior to 1 April 2004.
Where these exemptions have been used, they are explained under the relevant headings below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial information includes the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of Expro International Group PLC the company and the enterprises under its control its subsidiaries.
Control is defined as the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the group and are presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.
Adjustments are made, where necessary, to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with group policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to business combinations that took place before 1 April 2004.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
With the exception of goods sold under construction contracts, sales of goods are normally recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities is charged as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs which are expected to generate probable future economic benefits would be capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
All other development expenditure is charged to the income statement.
Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 The Expro Group FORTY-SEVEN Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Construction contracts Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
Stage of completion is determined by reference to the extent to which obligations identified at the commencement of the contract are considered to have been met.
These obligations may be contractual or non-contractual.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract costs incurred will be recovered.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense.
Share-based payments The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes under which shares are issued to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For schemes with only market based performance conditions, those conditions are taken into account in arriving at the fair value at the grant date.
Accordingly no subsequent adjustment to the amortised fair value is made for achievement or otherwise of those conditions.
For schemes that include non-market based conditions or no conditions, a true-up model is applied to the expense at each reporting date based on the expected number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a random walk stochastic model which takes into account exercise price, share price at date of grant, expected life, expected volatility of the share price, risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment with any impairment being charged to the income statement as it arises.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit.
Any remainder is then allocated to the assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture operation, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible assets Intangible assets, which include patents, licences and capitalised software expenditure, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset as follows: Patents and licences between 1 and 35 years Trade names between 10 and 15 years Customer relationships and contracts between 5 and 15 years Other between 1 and 10 years Intangible assets arising from a business combination whose fair value can be reliably measured are separated from goodwill and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful live is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
FORTY-EIGHT The Expro Group Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint control is defined as when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The group reports its interests in joint ventures using the equity method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are shown at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Property leasehold between 15 and 30 years freehold 50 years Plant and equipment between 3 and 12 years Assets in the course of construction are shown at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
Depreciation on these assets commences when they are placed in service.
Assets attributable to specific projects are depreciated over the useful life of the relevant project.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as equivalent owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their current location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash Cash comprises cash-in-hand and bank overdrafts, where there is right of offset.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as finance leases.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiary undertakings and jointly controlled entities except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 The Expro Group FORTY-NINE Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Retirement benefits The group provides pensions to its employees and directors through defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The schemes are wholly funded and their assets are held independently by trustees.
Payments to defined contribution benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The group has applied the provisions of IAS 19 and its amendment of December 2004 in full.
Subsequently, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
These gains and losses are not shown in the income statement but instead are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, or is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds in future contributions to the plan.
In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19 Employee Benefits all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on the groups defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in equity on the date of transition.
Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies that comprise the group, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value is determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, income statements of foreign operations are translated into sterling at monthly average rates which approximate to the actual rate for the relevant accounting periods.
Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on all balances, except foreign currency loans accounted for as net investment hedges, are taken to the income statement.
Exchange differences arising on consolidation of the net investments in overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, together with those on foreign currency loans accounted for as net investment hedges, are taken to equity.
An intra-group monetary item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, a part of the groups net investment in the foreign operation.
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of the groups net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of foreign operations, the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised directly in equity for that foreign operation are to be transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the group has reset these cumulative translation differences to zero on the transition to IFRS.
FIFTY The Expro Group Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments As permitted by IFRS 1, the group has elected to apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 April 2005.
As a result, the relevant comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2005 does not reflect the impact of these standards and is accounted for in accordance with UK GAAP.
The adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 represents a change in accounting policy and in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 has not been restated.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps and caps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate movements.
The group does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Under IFRS derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Provided that conditions specified by IAS 39 are met, a derivative financial instrument can be designated as a hedging instrument and hedge accounting can be applied.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction resulted in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 The Expro Group FIFTY-ONE Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact on the financial statements.
The most critical of these are: Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment In order to carry out the groups operations, it is necessary for it to hold significant amounts or property, plant and equipment.
At 31 March 2006, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment was 95.4m 2005: 72.4m.
These assets are depreciated in accordance with the policy outlined within this note.
Management reviews the appropriateness of assets useful economic lives at least annually and assesses any changes which could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Management believe that its approach to assessing useful economic lives, and in particular its assessment of whether assets are attributable to specific projects, is prudent.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairments The group is comprised of a number of products and services which arise from internal development expenditure or through the acquisition of specific businesses.
Management necessarily applies it judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent cash flows to appropriate cash-generating units CGUs, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the value-in-use calculation.
Subsequent changes to the CGU allocation or to the timing of asset cash flows could impact the respective assets.
Taxation The groups operations have wide geographic coverage, resulting in differing taxation regimes depending on the location in which those activities take place.
The effective rate reflects this broad geographic spread of profits, unrecoverable losses in certain territories, a variety of imputed and higher rate overseas tax regimes and non-deductible items.
Accounting provision must be made for taxation liabilities before tax returns are filed, and review or audit of these returns by the local taxation authorities can take place several years later.
Management makes provision for taxation liabilities on what it believes to be a fair and reasonable calculation of the probable liability, which includes recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities on temporary differences between accounting and taxable profit.
Changes in the underlying assumptions regarding the reversal of these differences, or in the tax regime where the differences arise, could result in significant changes in the carrying value of tax assets or liabilities.

Business and geographical segments For management purposes, the group is organised into two operating divisions Regional businesses and Global businesses.
These divisions are the basis on which the group reports its primary segment information.
Principal activities are as follows: Regional businesses provide services which are primarily driven by customer operating expenditure.
Customer requirements are often for a short period of time, and delivery is made through, and supported by, the groups locally established infrastructure.
Global businesses provide products and services which are primarily driven by customer capital expenditure.
These products and services, which are often based upon bespoke engineering or technology based solutions, are delivered remotely over a long term and are typically for offshore projects.

This interest was disposed of on 31 March 2005.
The results were not treated as discontinued as the sale of the joint venture did not represent the discontinuance of a separate major line of business nor a withdrawal from a geographical location.
The balance of consideration due in respect of this disposal, which amounted to 4,797,000, was received on 3 May 2005.

No individual CGU is considered significant in comparison with the total carrying value of goodwill.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill, which is comprised of several CGUs, had been allocated as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Regional businesses 15,744 13,070 Global businesses 10,136 10,135 25,880 23,205 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the year.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following three years based on an estimated growth rate of 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% is used.
No impairment of goodwill is required for year ended 31 March 2006.
An impairment charge of 4,971,000 was made in the year ended 31 March 2005 of which 4,000,000 related to the impairment against the carrying value of goodwill of Tripoint Inc. which was acquired on 1 February 2000.

The groups core funding is provided by a 115m multi-currency facility comprising a 45m term loan facility, a 25m revolving credit facility and a 45m bank overdraft facility.
All borrowings and overdrafts are arranged at floating interest rates and expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The fair value of the groups borrowings is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given frequency of resets.
The bank overdraft is drawn under the groups 45m multi-option bank overdraft, foreign exchange and bonding facility.
This facility carries an interest rate of 1% above LIBOR and is renewable on an annual basis with the next renewal taking place on 30 June 2006.
The overdraft facility was not in use on either of the balance sheet dates.
The bank loans comprise drawings under the groups 25m three year, multi-currency revolving credit facility carrying an interest rate of 1.4% above LIBOR, and under the groups 45m multi-currency term loan facility carrying an interest rate of 1.75% above LIBOR.
The loans re-price at a frequency of between one and six months.
The outstanding amount under the revolving credit facility is repayable on 30 June 2007, and the outstanding amount under the term loan facility is repayable in annual instalments over the period 30 June 2007 to 30 June 2011.
These facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the group.
At 31 March 2006 the group had 52m of committed borrowing facilities available.
The loans are collectively a designated net investment hedge against the groups overseas subsidiaries.
Foreigh exchange movements in the fair value of the loans are recognised directly in equity, offset against foreign exchange movements in the net investment.

Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the group and movements thereon during the current and previous years.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2006 2005 000 000 Deferred tax assets 6,365 3,470 Deferred tax liabilities 2,428 1,629 3,937 1,841 At the balance sheet date, the group has unused tax losses of 1.1m 2005: 5.4m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of such losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams 2005: deferred tax asset 1.1m.
These losses will expire in 2025.
Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 The Expro Group SIXTY-FIVE Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 23.
Derivative financial instruments As permitted by IFRS 1, the group has elected to apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 April 2005.
Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been adopted for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the balance sheet been restated as at that date, a net financial asset of 534,000 and an associated net deferred tax asset of 13,000 would have been recognised.
Currency derivatives The group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
In particular the group enters into forward foreign currency contracts, which are designated hedging instruments, based upon highly probable forecast foreign currency cash flows to minimise currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly US Dollars.
The total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that are in place at the balance sheet date is set out below: 2006 000 US Dollar denominated forward currency sale contracts 21,479 These arrangements are designed to address exchange exposures in the year ended 31 March 2007 and are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
The contracts in place at the balance sheet date have a maturity of six months or less from the balance sheet date.
At 31 March 2006 the fair value of the groups forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is a liability of 295,000.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments and the fair values are included within current liabilities.
Interest rate derivatives The groups policy on interest rate risk is designed to limit the groups exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
The borrowings as at 31 March 2006 are floating rate bank borrowings which bear interest fixed for periods between one and six months based upon LIBOR and as such are subject to cash flow interest rate risk.
Interest rate swap The group has a five year interest rate swap expiring on 15 May 2007 for 12 million at a fixed rate of 5.62%.
Interest payable or receivable under the swap during the year is the difference between three month LIBOR and the fixed swap rate of 5.62%.
This amount has been included in finance charges.
The fair value of the swap is a liability of 138,000.
This amount is based on the market value of the instrument at the balance sheet date.
This swap is not a designated hedging instrument and as such it is accounted for as at fair value through profit and loss.
Interest rate cap The group has a five year US Dollar interest rate cap for $40m at 6.25% expiring on 15 May 2007.
At the balance sheet date the cap had no fair value.
The cap is not a designated hedging instrument and as such it is accounted for as at fair value through profit and loss.
Comparative disclosures previously published This is the first year that the group has applied IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Comparative data prepared under UK GAAP FRS 13 Financial Instruments for 2005 has been reproduced from the 2005 Annual Report.
The analysis is set out more fully below: Accounting policy The group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps and caps to reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the groups financial statements.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge the instrument is marked to market and any resultant profit or loss recognised at that time.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The group has a significant operating cash inflow in Sterling and US Dollars, and to a lesser extent, Euros, Canadian and Australian Dollars.
To minimise currency risk, the group takes out US Dollar forward foreign exchange contracts based upon forecast foreign currency net cash flows.
In addition, during the year, the group utilised an interest rate cap and a fixed for floating interest rate swap to hedge interest rate risk associated with floating interest rates.
The group does not utilise any financial derivatives for speculative purposes.
SIXTY-SIX The Expro Group Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 23.
Derivative financial instruments continued The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in FRS 13.
Certain financial assets, such as investments in subsidiary companies and employers obligations to employees under employee share option and employee share schemes, are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS 13, the short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than currency disclosures.
Interest rate profile The group does not hold any financial assets other than short term debtors and cash in current bank accounts.
Short term debtors are non-interest bearing and cash in current bank accounts receive interest based on LIBOR.
The groups financial liabilities other than short term creditors are as follows: Fixed rate Floating rate Total 2005 2005 2005 000 000 000 US Dollar borrowings 12,000 30,747 42,747 Canadian Dollar borrowings 4,365 4,365 Euro borrowings 6,883 6,883 Australian Dollar borrowings 4,720 4,720 12,000 46,715 58,715 At 31 March 2005 the group has a five year interest rate swap expiring on 15 May 2007 for 12m at a fixed rate of 5.62% which constitutes the weighted average rates for fixed rate borrowings at 31 March 2005.
In addition, at 31 March 2005 the group had a five year US Dollar interest rate cap for $40m at 6.25% also expiring on 15 May 2007.
The remaining borrowings as at 31 March 2005 are bank borrowings which bear interest fixed for periods between one and six months based upon LIBOR.
Currency exposure The table below shows the groups currency exposures which are those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the group that are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved.
As at 31 March 2005 these exposures were as follows: Functional currency of group operation Sterling US Dollar Other Total 2005 2005 2005 2005 000 000 000 000 Sterling 18 352 370 US Dollar 529 764 1,293 Canadian Dollar 5 24 93 122 Euro 630 142 772 Total 106 148 1,023 769 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of any forward contracts entered into to mitigate the effect of currency exposures.
As at 31 March 2005 the group also held open US Dollar forward currency contracts that had been taken out to hedge expected future foreign currency sales in the 12 months from 31 March 2005 with a net maturity value of 33m 2004: 30m.
Borrowing facilities The groups total borrowing facility is a 115m multi-currency facility comprising a 45m term loan facility, 45m revolving credit facility and a 25m bank overdraft, foreign exchange and bonding facility.
As at 31 March 2005 the group had 54m 2004: 60m undrawn committed borrowing facilities expiring in more than one year in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

Derivative financial instruments continued Fair values The group does not hold any financial assets other than short term debtors and cash in current bank accounts.
The groups financial liabilities comprise short term creditors, bank loans, overdrafts, forward foreign currency contracts, an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap.
Short term debtors and creditors that arise directly form the groups operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note.
A comparison of book values and fair values of the groups financial assets and liabilities other than short term debtors and creditors as at 31 March 2005 is as follows: Book Fair value value restated restated 2005 2005 000 000 Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations: Borrowings 58,715 58,715 Financial assets 5,009 5,009 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swap 11 158 Interest rate cap 195 13 Forward US Dollar currency contracts 1,022 The fair values of the interest rate swap, cap and the forward foreign currency contracts have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments involved are traded.
All other financial instruments are at variable interest rates and the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value is not material.
Gains and losses on hedges The group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly US Dollars.
It also utilises interest rate swaps and caps to manage its interest rate profile.
Changes in the fair value of forward currency contracts are not recognised in the financial statements until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
An analysis of these unrecognised gains and losses is as follows: Gains Losses Net 2005 2005 2005 000 000 000 Unrecognised net gains on hedges at the start of the year 3,374 476 2,898 Net gains arising in previous years, recognised in the current year 3,374 201 3,173 Net losses arising before current year, not recognised in the current year 275 275 Net gains arising in current year, not recognised in the current year 1,022 54 968 Unrecognised net gains on hedges at the end of the year 1,022 329 693 Of which: Net gains expected to be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2006 1,022 179 843 Net losses expected to be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2007 or later 150 150 SIXTY-EIGHT The Expro Group Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 24.

Share-based payments Equity settled share option plans Included within wages and salaries in note 7 is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 615,014 2005: 416,913 all of which relates to equity settled share-based payments.
Details of each of the employee share plans in place are given below and where applicable in the remuneration report.
Below is a summary of the schemes in place during the year: a Executive share option scheme The group operates an executive share option scheme under which awards of share options are made to selected individuals directors and senior managers based on the achievement of an EPS growth target set at the Retail Price Index plus a margin and established at the date of grant.
The EPS growth is calculated for a continuous three year period during the normal exercise period.
When the EPS growth is met the options vest and can be exercised within ten years of the grant date.
b Performance share plan Under the 2003 and 2004 awards, selected individuals directors and senior managers receive an award of shares based on the growth in the Total Shareholder Return TSR for the group over a three year performance period when compared to growth in TSR of FTSE mid 250 companies, provided that the Remuneration Committee are satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the company has improved on a sustainable basis over the period.
To the extent that any options vest, they will ordinarily remain exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant and are settled in equity once exercised.
Under the 2005 award, which was restricted to executive directors, an award may be made, provided a non-market-based performance condition of specified EPS growth is achieved over a three year performance period.
c Sharesave scheme Under the schemes, which are open to all employees of eligible group companies, employees are granted share options at a discount to the open market value at the date of grant.
The employees enter into a savings plan for a three year period after which they have a choice of exercising their option or withdrawing saved funds.
No conditions other than continued employment are attached to the grant.
d Share matching plan Under the scheme, selected individuals directors and senior managers may invest a portion of their annual cash bonus in the companys shares at open market price.
Based on the amount invested, the group will award free matching shares after a three year vesting period equivalent to the amount invested at the grant date share price, grossed up for tax.

SEVENTY-SIX The Expro Group Annual Report and Accounts for year ended 31 March 2006 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued Year ended 31 March 2006 31.
Retirement benefit schemes The group operates a number of pension schemes consisting of the main scheme for UK based employees and several smaller schemes for overseas employees.
All of the schemes are wholly funded and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group.
Main scheme The main scheme comprises two parts: a a defined benefit scheme, which from 1 October 1999 was closed to new joiners.
The contributions to the scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of regular valuations.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 6 April 2005. b a defined contribution scheme was opened upon the closure of the defined benefit scheme, to new joiners.
Employee contributions are matched by an employer contribution up to a ceiling of 5% of basic salary.
The pension cost charge for the year of the groups defined contribution schemes amounted to 1,501,000 2005: 1,184,000.
Other schemes The group operates defined benefit and insured defined benefit arrangements in Holland and Norway.
The assets of insured schemes are insurance contracts which guarantee the pensions secured to date and an annual valuation of the scheme amends the contribution rate each year.
Defined benefit schemes The major assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit scheme liabilities under IAS 19 Employment benefits were: 2006 2005 % % Key assumptions used: Discount rate 5.0 5.5 Expected return on scheme assets 6.6 6.7 Expected rate of salary increases 3.9 3.9 Future pension increases 2.9 2.9 The expected long term return on cash is based on cash deposit rates available at the balance sheet date.
The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities and property have been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Current service cost 2,999 2,235 Interest cost 3,977 3,127 Expected return on scheme assets 3,232 2,648 Curtailments 73 3,671 2,714 Of the current service cost for the year, 1,560,000 2005: 1,155,000 has been included in cost of sales and 1,439,000 2005: 1,080,000 has been included in administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense is 3,396,000 2005: 7,847,000.
The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the year ended 31 March 2007 is 3,784,000.

Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 April 2004.
First-time adoption exemptions applied The requirements for the first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In general, IFRS 1 requires that accounting policies be adopted that are compliant with IFRS and that these policies be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
However, under IFRS 1, a number of exemptions are permitted to be taken in preparing the balance sheet as at the date of transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004.
These exemptions are explained below: The group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to business combinations that took place before 1 April 2004: The group has elected to set the foreign currency translation reserve to zero at 1 April 2004.
Any gain or loss on disposal of foreign operations will include only those cumulative translation differences arising after that date: The group has elected not to apply the provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to options and awards that were granted on or before 7 November 2002 or which had not vested by 1 January 2005: The group has taken advantage of the exemption to apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 April 2005 only.
As a result no adjustment to the 2005 UK GAAP financial statements was required: and In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19 Employee Benefits all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on the groups defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in equity in the transition date balance sheet.
Significant adjustments a Goodwill amortisation IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that goodwill is not amortised but instead is subject to an impairment review annually or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to business combinations that took place before 1 April 2004. b Intangible assets Business combinations since the date of transition have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations with intangible assets recognised and amortised over their useful economic lives where they are separable or arise from a contractual or legal right.
IAS 12 Income Taxes requires provision for the effects of deferred tax arising on intangible assets resulting from business combinations.
The deferred tax asset or liability is matched by a corresponding adjustment to the goodwill arising on these business combinations.
Matre Instruments AS was acquired by the group in February 2005 giving rise to goodwill on acquisition of 5,703,000 under UK GAAP.
In applying IFRS 3 the group has reclassified intangible assets arising on acquisition of 3,389,000 out of goodwill, representing the values placed on the Matre trade name, customer relationships, library of technical information and other intangible assets.
Amortisation charged on these intangible assets during the two month period from acquisition to 31 March 2005 was 103,000. c Property, plant and equipment IAS 17 Leases requires separate consideration of the land and building elements of leases in determining whether the arrangement is a finance lease or an operating lease.
Buildings deemed to be held under finance leases are required to be shown within property, plant and equipment with a corresponding liability recorded within finance leases.
The buildings are then depreciated and the relevant lease payments are allocated between capital repayment and a finance charge element.
Arrangements concerning the groups leased property have been reviewed in light of the specific requirements of IAS 17 resulting in certain of these leases requiring classification under IFRS as finance leases.
Following the review property leases with a value of 6,414,000 as at 1 April 2004 were recognised under property, plant and equipment with a corresponding liability of 7,009,000 recognised under finance leases.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued d Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payments requires that the expense incurred for equity instruments granted is recognised in the financial statements at their fair value measured at the date of grant and that the expense is recognised over the vesting period of the instrument.
IAS 12 Income Taxes requires provision for the effects of share-based payments beyond the tax charge recognised in the income statement.
The amount of deferred tax is required to be calculated based upon the number of share options outstanding at the balance sheet date by reference to the difference between the grant price and the market value of the shares at that date.
Changes to the amount of deferred tax in excess of the charge reported in the income statement are recognised in equity.
The charge recognised for share-based payment under UK GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2005 was 491,000.
This amount, along with the related tax effect of 147,000 recognised in the period, has been reversed under IFRS.
The IFRS 2 charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 was 417,000 with a tax effect of 125,000.
At 31 March 2005 a deferred tax asset of 476,000 is recognised in the balance sheet.
In accordance with IAS 12, 351,000 of this amount was recognised in equity with the balance shown as an adjustment to the tax charge within the income statement for that period.
e Employee benefits Under UK GAAP, the group accounted for post-employment benefits under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, whereby the cost of providing defined benefit pensions was charged against operating profit on a systematic basis with surpluses and deficits arising being amortised over the expected average remaining service lives of participating employees.
Additional transitional disclosures required under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits based on the valuation methods required by the standard were also provided.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits takes a similar approach to that of FRS 17, in that it requires the actuarial surplus or deficit relating to defined benefit post-employment schemes to be directly recognised at fair value on the groups balance sheet.
IAS 19 allows the effects of any movements in the surpluses or deficits to be immediately recognised in equity.
IAS 19 requires that the service cost element of pensions and other post-employment benefits be recognised separately from the financing elements within the income statement.
The financing charge represents the net impact of the unwinding of the discount on the schemes liabilities in the current year and the expected return on the schemes assets.
The deficit on the groups defined benefit pension schemes is recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19, along with the resulting deferred tax asset.
The balances at the date of transition to IFRS and at 31 March 2005 are as follows: 31 March 1 April 2005 2004 000 000 Pension scheme deficit 23,882 16,073 Deferred tax asset 6,997 4,559 f Deferred tax IAS 12 Income Taxes requires that deferred taxation should be provided on all temporary differences and not just timing differences as required under UK GAAP.
The main areas in which accounting for deferred tax differs under IFRS are set out below.
i Temporary differences arising on business combinations The increase in the difference between the carrying value of non-current assets and the tax base as a result of fair value adjustments to business combinations is not considered to be a timing difference under current UK GAAP, but is regarded as a temporary difference under IFRS.
An adjustment is therefore required to reflect the increase in the deferred tax liability at the date of transition to IFRS.
The resulting deferred tax liability changes at subsequent balance sheet dates due to the amortisation or impairment of the underlying non-current asset.
ii Pensions and post-employment benefits Under UK GAAP an asset or liability in respect of a post-employment benefit scheme was recognised to the extent that the timing of payments differed from the reported charge or credit for the period.
IAS19 requires the deficit or surplus arising on a post-employment benefit scheme to be reflected on a companys balance sheet.
This deficit or surplus is a temporary difference and results in the recognition of a deferred tax liability or asset under IAS 12.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued iii Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable, or there is a binding agreement in place with the subsidiary to distribute past earnings.
Under IFRS, deferred tax must be provided for in respect of all such earnings except where the parent company controls the flow of dividends and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses and other deductible temporary differences where it is probable that future taxable profit will utilise the tax losses and credits.
At 31 March 2005 a deferred tax asset of 1,040,000 was reported in the UK GAAP balance sheet.
The IFRS balance sheet at that date includes a deferred tax asset of 3,470,000 and a deferred tax liability of 1,629,000.
Deferred tax adjustments arising on the transition to IFRS have been offset only to the extent that this offset is permitted under IAS 12. h Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, the group recognised a liability for dividends that were proposed in respect of a prior accounting period, even if formal authorisation of the dividend did not take place until after the year end.
In accordance with IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability in the financial statements, as there is no present obligation to pay the dividends at the balance sheet date.
Net assets and equity have been increased to reflect the reversal of the accrual for proposed ordinary dividends which had not been declared at the balance sheet dates, as follows: 31 March 1 April 2005 2004 000 000 Adjustment to net assets on reversal of proposed dividend 4,706 Recognition of prior period dividend in subsequent period 4,692 4,692 14 4,692 i Cumulative foreign translation differences Under UK GAAP, the cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising on retranslation of the groups net investment in foreign operations into sterling were recognised in reserves.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedged the groups net investment in these foreign operations, were also recognised in reserves.
Under IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, cumulative foreign currency translation differences are required to be recognised as a separate component of equity and should be taken into account in calculating the gain or loss on the disposal of a foreign operation.
As permitted under IFRS 1 the group has elected to deem cumulative translation differences to be nil on 1 April 2004.
