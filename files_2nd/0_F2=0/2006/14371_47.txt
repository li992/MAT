Financial Instruments ForeignExchange Exposures The Group trades in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translation foreign exchange exposure.
The Groups policy is to protect equity by matching foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities wherever practicable.
These liabilities take the form of either borrowings in the Groups operating units or currency swaps where operations are financed using intragroup loans.
It is the Groups policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functionalcurrencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, the currency cost of purchases by Group companies of finished products and raw materials.
The principal flows of currency are purchases of US Dollars and Sterling from Euros, Japanese yen and Australian dollars, as well as cross purchases between the US and the UK.
The Group partly mitigates the translational impact on profits through the interest arising on foreign currency borrowings or swaps.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreignexchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for between 50% and 90% of forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into forward foreign exchange contracts are used to increase the hedges to 100% of the exposure.
The cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and the profits and losses on the hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within a further twelve month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are Sterling and US Dollars.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had contracted to exchange withinoneyear the equivalent of $425m.
In 2005, the Group entered into a contingent foreign exchange contract to exchange 430m for US Dollars maturing on the date of receipt of the proceeds of the sale of the BSN Medical joint venture.
No amounts would have been receivable or payable under the contract if the sale of BSN Medical had failed to complete.
The contract was shown in the 2005 accounts at fair value based on the expected completion date.
Interest Rate Exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and currency swaps which are all at floating rates.
TheGroup had not fixed future interest rates at 31 December 2006. Credit Risk Exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentrationof credit risk.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2006 was $6m being the gross debit fair value onforward foreignexchange contracts.
