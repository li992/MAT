New standards and interpretations not applied During the year the IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
Of these, only the following are expected to be relevant to the group: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 19 Amendment Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Fair Value Option 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 Transition and Initial Recognition of Financial 1 January 2006 Assets and Financial Liabilities Day 1 Profits IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2006 IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 January 2006 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specifically, the group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Kelda Group plc 54 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 3.
Segmental information The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
Secondary segment information is reported geographically.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transfers between business segments.
Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.
It is not possible to split the pension deficit between the UK subsidiary companies.
It is therefore recognised within unallocated.

Dividends amounting to 0.9m 2005: 1.2m in respect of the companys shares held by the ESOT see note 23 have been waived and are therefore excluded from the aggregate of dividends paid and proposed.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The ordinary shares held in the ESOT are excluded from the weighted average number of shares for this purpose.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year.

Goodwill has arisen within two operating segments.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated between the operating segments as follows: 2006 2005 m m UK regulated water services continuing operations 14.1 14.1 US operations discontinued operations 212.1 194.5 226.2 208.6 a UK regulated water services Goodwill arose on the acquisition of the entire share capital of York Waterworks plc on 8 March 1999.
Following the transition to IFRS goodwill is no longer amortised and is instead subject to annual impairment reviews.
The recoverable amount is determined on a value in use basis using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board covering a four year period.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.12% 2005: 8.12%.
No growth rate was assumed.
b US operations The recoverable amount is determined on a value in use basis using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board covering a four year period.
The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the four year period is 2.0% 2005: 2.0%.
The growth rate is based upon industry standard rates.
The value in use is sensitive to the following assumptions: Discount rates: These reflect managements estimate of return on capital employed ROCE required in the business.
The rates applied are based on the spread between current ROCE and base interest rates.
Growth rate assumptions: As disclosed above these are based on published industry research.
With regard to the assessment of value in use, management believes that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

a Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the groups financial liabilities at 31 March, after taking account of the interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest and currency profile, was as follows: Financial liabilities Within 12 23 34 45 More than 1 year years years years years 5 years Total Year ended 31 March 2006 m m m m m m m Fixed rate Bank loans 14.3 14.5 24.7 25.0 27.1 202.7 308.3 6.625% bond 2031 240.2 240.2 6.875% guaranteed bonds 2010 199.3 199.3 5.25% Eurobond 2006 50.0 50.0 5.375% bond 2023 196.1 196.1 Other loans 1.2 132.4 133.6 Preference shares 0.6 0.6 Finance lease swaps 1.5 1.4 3.3 0.2 8.9 15.3 65.8 15.1 26.1 28.3 227.8 780.3 1,143.4 Floating rate Short term loan 4.4 4.4 Bank overdraft 3.2 3.2 5.25% Eurobond 2006 379.0 379.0 3.048% index linked bond 2033 108.0 108.0 Other loans 3.1 2.7 5.8 Finance leases 7.9 6.2 9.0 9.6 10.3 411.4 454.4 397.6 6.2 9.0 12.3 10.3 519.4 954.8 Financial assets Floating rate Cash and short term deposits 101.5 101.5 Financial assets 27.8 27.8 129.3 129.3 Kelda Group plc 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 25.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is Aor better.
c Foreign currency risk The group may borrow in appropriate foreign currencies in order to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas.
The foreign exchange exposure on the translation into sterling of the net assets of Aquarion, which are denominated in US dollars, is hedged by a mixture of US dollar currency swaps and forward contracts.
There are no currency exposures on short term debtors and creditors or monetary assets and liabilities giving rise to a profit and loss account charge.
Kelda Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 75 Notes to the group accounts Year ended 31 March 2006 d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the book values and the fair values of the groups financial assets and liabilities, including those classified under discontinued operations, at 31 March.

e Hedges The groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk within approved board policies and guidelines.
Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements are used to manage interest rate exposure under a policy that requires between 85% and 95% of Yorkshire Water Services Limiteds net debt and 70% and 95% of Kelda Group plcs net debt to be held at fixed rates.
At the financial year end the proportions were 85% and 77% respectively.
Hedging of Eurobond 625m In July 1999 the group issued a 7 year 625m 5.25% Eurobond to finance the groups US acquisition and to provide further funds for the non-UK regulated business.
During 2003, 12.1m was bought back, leaving a nominal value outstanding of 612.9m.
The group does not have a requirement for euros and is exposed to movements in the euro sterling exchange rate which affects the sterling equivalent of the loan.
The exposure occurs at each reporting date and also upon ultimate repayment of the loan.
In order to fully protect the sterling liability the group has entered into a number of hedging instruments.
The euro fixed rate liability has been swapped in the most part into a floating rate sterling liability with a proportion swapped into a fixed rate sterling liability in a series of swaps.
The combination of the series of swaps is considered to be a hedge of the underlying requirement to pay fixed rate euro interest.
The hedging mechanism is a perfect hedge against the liability to pay fixed rate euro interest because the dates of interest payments under the series of swaps are the same as the dates on which interest repayments are due per the original bond.
The fair value of the hedging instrument at 31 March 2006 was an unrealised gain of 27.8m 2005: 32.2m gain.
The cash flow hedge was assessed to be highly effective at 31 March 2006 and an unrealised loss of 4.4m 2005: 3.5m relating to the hedging instrument was included in equity, however it was fully offset by the unrealised loss on the Eurobond.
Hedging of interest due under finance leases Yorkshire Water has a number of finance leases with a number of counterparties lasting from inception for periods up to 32 years.
In each instance interest payable under the lease is set once a year in late March or early April based on 12 month LIBOR.
Yorkshire Water is therefore exposed to changes in 12 month LIBOR which could have a material effect on interest costs from year to year.
In order to fix the interest cost on a proportion of its net debt, Yorkshire Water has entered into a number of floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps.
Kelda Group plc 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 25.
Financial instruments continued e Hedges continued Hedging of interest due under finance leases continued The hedging instrument is a perfect cash flow hedge against changes in 12 month LIBOR for the period of the swap agreements because the dates of interest payments under the swaps are the same as the dates on which interest is due per the leasing agreements and the nominal value of the swaps that hedge the cost total less than the nominal value outstanding.
The fair value of the hedging instrument at 31 March 2006 was an unrealised loss of 13.5m 2005: 10.9m loss.
The cash flow hedge was assessed to be highly effective at 31 March 2006 and an unrealised loss of 1.8m 2005: 2.3m gain relating to the hedging instrument was included in equity net of deferred tax.
Hedging of investments in foreign operations At each reporting date the group translates the dollar value in the UK investment in the US operations into sterling at the closing rate.
To hedge against movements in the US dollar sterling exchange rate the group has entered into cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts.
Together these two instruments hedge $461m of the groups exposure.
The two hedging mechanisms are perfect hedges and both are translated at each reporting date using the same exchange rates as that used in retranslating the investment.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of these instruments are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on the retranslation of the investment in the subsidiary.
Share-based payments Share options The employee share option plans are open to all qualifying employees and provide for an exercise price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less 20%.
The options will vest if the employee remains in service for the full duration of the option scheme either three or five years.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.

The options outstanding at 31 March 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of 4.50, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.5 years.
The fair value of the share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes statistical model.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model are as follows: 2006 2005 Share price at date of grant 735p 629p Exercise price 588p 461p Expected volatility 25% 25% Expected life 3 and 5 years 3 and 5 years Risk free rate 4.56% 4.81% Expected dividends 30p 29p Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over the previous 6 years.
Kelda Group plc Kelda Group plc Annual Repor Annual Reportt and Accounts 2006 and Accounts 2006 77 77 Notes to the group accounts Year ended 31 March 2006 Long term incentive plan LTIP Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan have two separate vesting conditions, both of which are dependent on market-based conditions.
The market-based conditions of the award are taken into account in valuing the award at the grant date by applying the probability that the LTIPs will vest to the current market price of the groups shares.
At each subsequent balance sheet date the group revises its estimate of the number of employees who will receive awards.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
70% of the full value of the LTIPs will vest based on the companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the performance period three years.
The groups share performance will be compared with reference to the six UK listed water companies.
At the end of the performance period the TSR of all seven companies will be calculated, and the results ranked.
Full vesting will require top ranking and, if Kelda is ranked between median and top position, between 30% and 100% of the shares will vest depending on how close Keldas TSR is to the first and fourth companies.
For the remaining 30%, the groups TSR will be compared to the constituents of the FTSE 350 index.
No shares will vest unless Kelda is ranked at least median.
30% vest at median and 100% will vest if Kelda is in the top 20% of companies, with pro-rata vestings based on ranking position for intermediate performance.
