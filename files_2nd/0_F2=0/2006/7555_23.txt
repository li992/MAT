Relating to the disposal of the MFI Retail operations As disclosed at the time of the transaction with MEP Mayflower Limited MEP, the Company is the ultimate guarantor on leases in relation to 56 properties which are occupied by the MFI Retail operations.
If MEP suffers financial distress and defaults on its obligations under the relevant leases the Companys guarantees are triggered.
For the period ended 25 December 2005 the net rentals payable by the Company in respect of these properties totalled 15.8m.
Remaining lease terms range between 6 months and 15 years from 30 December 2006.
The Company is not aware of any signs which indicate that the purchaser is in financial distress.
There is uncertainty whether the purchaser will ever suffer financial distress and thereby trigger the guarantee, and as to whether there would be any actual net liability if the Company ever did have to meet the lease obligations, given that the Company could mitigate any liabilities by surrendering or assigning the leases, or by subletting them to third parties.
Because of the nature of the uncertainties, as described above, the Company is unable to give an estimate of the financial effect of this contingent liability.
The Company is also exposed to potential costs in respect of certain warranties and indemnities in relation to the disposal agreement in favour of the purchaser.
The Company has made such provision as is considered necessary in this respect.
Other guarantees The Company has guaranteed a US$10.0m 2005: US$10.0m letter of credit facility from Standard Chartered Bank in favour of MFI Asia Limiteds suppliers.
This contingency would only trigger in the event that MFI Asia Limited fails to honour its obligations under the terms of the facility.
Members of the Group have assigned UK property leases in the normal course of business.
Should the assignees fail to fulfil any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the Group will be liable for those defaults.
The number of claims arising to date has been small and the cost, which is charged to income as it arises, has not been material.
There is a Group VAT registration cross-guarantee under which if one Group company fails to pay its VAT then the other Group companies are jointly and severally liable.
The amount outstanding on this guarantee at the period end is 19.0m 2005: 19.0m.
In February 2006, the Group refinanced its medium-term debt.
The Company, together with other Group companies, has guaranteed the obligations under the new bank facility.
The Company has guaranteed payments due by certain Group subsidiaries to one of their suppliers.
In the unlikely event that the subsidiaries do not meet their own payments, the liability under this guarantee is capped at 10m and 5m.
c. Other Aon have made a claim of 11.5m against the Company in respect of termination of an extended warranty agreement.
On the basis of information available, the Company has been advised that there is little merit in the claim.
