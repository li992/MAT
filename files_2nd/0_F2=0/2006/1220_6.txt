Notes to the IFRS financial statements 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies The business of the Group ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies ARM or the Group design reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors, physical IP and related technology and software and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and powerefficiency of high-volume embedded applications.
The Group licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard processors ASSPs based on the Groups architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
By creating a network of Partners, and working with them to best utilise the Groups technology, the Group is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including smart cards and digital video.
The Group also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers.
The Groups principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled under the laws of England and Wales.
The registered office of the Company is 110 Fulbourn Road, Cambridge, CB1 9NJ.
The Company was formed on 16 October 1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer UK Limited and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc.
Its initial public offering was on 17 April 1998.
Group undertakings include ARM Limited incorporated in the UK, ARM Inc. incorporated in the US, ARM KK incorporated in Japan, ARM Korea Limited incorporated in South Korea, ARM France SAS incorporated in France, Soisic SA incorporated in France, acquired during 2006, ARM Belgium N. V. incorporated in Belgium, ARM Germany GmbH incorporated in Germany, Keil Elektronik GmbH incorporated in Germany, ARM Norway AS incorporated in Norway, acquired and renamed during 2006, ARM Embedded Technologies Pvt.
Limited incorporated in India, ARM Physical IP Asia Pacific Pte.
Limited incorporated in Singapore, ARM Taiwan Limited incorporated in Taiwan and ARM Consulting Shangai Co. Limited incorporated in PR China.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale investments and derivative instruments.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make critical accounting estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
These estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
As discussed in detail in note 16, estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGUs and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present values of those cash flows.
Provisions for income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Provision for impairment of trade receivables The Group assesses trade receivables for impairment which requires the directors to estimate the likelihood of payment forfeiture by customers.
Legal settlements and other contingencies Determining the amount to be accrued for legal settlement requires the directors to estimate the committed future legal and settlement fees the Group is expecting to incur.
Where suits are filed against the Group for infringement of patents, the directors assess the extent of any potential infringement based on legal advice and written opinions received from external counsel and then estimate the level of accrual required.
Contingent consideration for an acquisition is recognised as part of the purchase consideration if the contingent conditions are expected to be satisfied.
This requires the directors to estimate the acquirees future financial performance, typically more than one year post-acquisition.
Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of licence agreements which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised on a  method basis.
Use of this method requires the directors to estimate the total project resource requirement and also any losses on uncompleted contracts.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation.
All subsidiaries use uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events and similar circumstances.
Business combinations The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
42 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is measured at cost less impairment losses.
In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of completion, the fair value of share options assumed is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon whether the directors believe any performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will be payable.
As permitted by IFRS 1, First-time adoption of international financial reporting standards, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
The Group performs its annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
At the date of transition, and at the annual tests in 2005 and 2006, impairment tests showed there was no impairment with respect to goodwill.
Available-for-sale investments Publicly-traded investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at market value.
Unrealised holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, directly in equity via a revaluation reserve.
Impairment losses and realised gains and losses of such securities are reported in earnings.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are also classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.
At 31 December 2006 and 2005, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated to cost less any permanent diminution in value, based on estimates determined by the directors.
Research and development expenditure All ongoing research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Where a product is technically feasible, production and sale are intended, a market exists, expenditure can be measured reliably, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product.
The Group believes its current process for developing products is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility which is evidenced by a working model.
Accordingly, development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant and, therefore, no costs have been capitalised to date.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Any collaborative agreements whereby a third party agrees to partially fund the Groups research and development is recognised over the period of the agreement as a credit within research and development costs.
Impairment charges The Group considers at each reporting date whether there is any indication that non-current assets are impaired.
If there is such an indication, the Group carries out an impairment test by measuring the assets recoverable amount, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised, and the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
In addition, as discussed under Goodwill above, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
Revenue recognition The Group follows the principles of IAS 18, Revenue recognition, in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies.
In principle, therefore, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue excluding VAT comprises the value of sales of licences, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees ARM technology-based products, revenues from support, maintenance and training, consulting contracts and the sale of boards and software toolkits.
Revenue from standard licence products which are not modified to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the customer.
Many licence agreements are for products which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer.
Revenue from the sale of such licences is recognised on a  basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
The  is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement, which approximates to the extent of performance.
Where invoicing milestones on licence arrangements are such that the receipts fall due significantly outside the period over which the customisation is expected to be performed or significantly outside its normal payment terms for standard licence arrangements, the Group evaluates whether it is probable that economic benefits associated with these milestones will flow to the Group and therefore whether these receipts should initially be included in the arrangement consideration.
In particular, it considers: whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice will be raised in the expected timeframe, particularly where the invoicing milestone is in some way dependent on customer activity: whether it has sufficient evidence that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled: whether there is sufficient certainty that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will indeed be incurred before the customer will accept that a future invoice may be raised: and the extent to which previous experience with similar product groups and similar customers support the conclusions reached.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with such future milestones will flow to the Group, taking into account these criteria, such milestones are excluded from the arrangement consideration until there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
The Group does not discount future invoicing milestones, as the effect of so doing would be immaterial.
If the amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts invoiced to customers, the excess amount is recorded as amounts recoverable on contracts within accounts receivable.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 43 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Where agreements involve several components, the entire fee from such arrangements is allocated to each of the individual components based on each components fair value, where fair value is the price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately.
The Group uses vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value to determine fair value of the individual components in multiple-component agreements.
VSOE is determined by reference to licence agreements with other customers where the components are sold, where fair value is the price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately.
Where, in substance, two elements of a contract are linked and cannot be allocated to the individual components, the revenue recognition criteria are applied to the elements as if they were a single element.
Agreements including rights to unspecified products as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements are accounted for using subscription accounting, with revenue from the arrangement being recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Group and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licences to the product.
In those cases where the Group makes sales of these products and is exposed to the significant risks and benefits associated with the transaction, the total value of the licence is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Group records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-delivery service support, in the form of support, maintenance and training which consists of the right to receive services and or unspecified product upgrades or enhancements that are offered on a  basis.
Fees for post-delivery service support, which takes place after customer acceptance of delivery, are generally specified in the contract.
Revenue related to post-delivery service support is recognised based on VSOE of fair value, which is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates.
If no renewal rates are specified, the entire fee under the transaction is amortised and recognised on a straight-line basis over the contractual post-delivery service support period.
Where renewal rates are specified, revenue for post-delivery service support is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Group with the licensee.
The excess of licence fees and post-delivery service support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred revenue.
Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence such as off-the-shelf software are recognised upon delivery, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
At that time, the Group has no further obligations except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing PCS have been accrued.
Services such as training that the Group provides which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately.
Revenue is recognised as services are performed and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Groups customers of products containing ARM technology.
Royalty revenues are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
As disclosed above, in accordance with IAS 8, Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the Group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies.
In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the  accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The use of the  method is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, there is an insignificant risk that customer acceptance is not obtained.
The Group also makes assessments, based on prior experience, of the extent to which future milestone receipts represent a probable future economic benefit to the Group.
In addition, when allocating revenue to various components of arrangements involving several components, it is assumed that the fair value of each element is reflected by its price when sold separately.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Government grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement to match the projects related expenditure.
Retirement benefit costs The Group contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China, Israel and India.
The Group contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation, and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and short-term marketable securities The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year to be either short-term investments or short-term marketable securities.
Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long term.
44 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Provision for impairment of trade receivables Trade receivables are first assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant.
Where there is no objective evidence of impairment for an individual receivable, it is included in a group of receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and these are collectively assessed for impairment.
Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables are recorded in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, plant and equipment The cost of property, plant and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
External costs and internal costs are capitalised to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers Three to five years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Asset lives and residual values are reviewed on an annual basis.
Acquired intangible assets Computer software, purchased patents and licences to use technology are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from them, which is typically three to five years.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed into operational use, are capitalised.
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, the directors are primarily responsible for determining the fair value of intangible assets.
Developed technology, existing agreements and customer relationships, core technology, trademarks and tradenames, and order backlog are capitalised and amortised over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from them.
In-process research and development projects purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IFRS 3, Business combinations, for recognition as intangible assets other than goodwill.
The directors track the status of in-process research and development intangible assets such that their amortisation commences when the assets are brought into use.
This typically means a write-off period of one to five years.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of intangible assets, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Computer software Three to five years Patents and licences Three to five years In-process research and development One to five years Developed technology One to five years Existing agreements and customer relationships Two to six years Core technology Five years Trademarks and tradenames Four to five years Order backlog One year Provision is made against the carrying value of acquired intangible assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Currency translation The functional currency of each Group entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentation currency of the Group.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into the functional currency of each Group entity at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Such exchange differences have been included in general and administrative expenses.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 45 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income statements of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the period.
Translation differences are taken directly to equity via the cumulative translation adjustment.
On disposal of a subsidiary such amounts are recycled to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Groups currency exchange contracts do not subject the Group to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
The currency exchange contracts and related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
All recognised gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative expenses in the income statement.
The Group does not enter into currency exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Embedded derivatives From time to time, the Group enters into contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer or the collaborative partner.
Where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Group carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative expenses.
Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the temporary differences will be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising in the same tax jurisdiction are offset.
In the UK and the US, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as compensation on exercise of certain employee share options under each jurisdictions tax rules.
As explained under Share-based payments below, a compensation expense is recorded in the Groups income statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options.
As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Companys share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
As explained under Share-based payments below, no compensation charge is recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002 or in respect of those options which have been exercised or have lapsed before 1 January 2005.
Nevertheless, tax deductions have arisen and will continue to arise on these options.
The tax effects arising in relation to these options are recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury stock and those shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2006 excludes incremental shares of approximately 33,390,000 2005: 39,614,000 related to employee share options and RSUs.
These shares are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
Options under these schemes are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which stipulates that the saving period must be at least 36 months.
The Group has recognised a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans and US ESPPs.
The charges for these are calculated as detailed above.
The Group also has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognise a compensation charge under IFRS 2, calculated as detailed above.
The Group has applied the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of IFRS 2 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The share-based payments charge is allocated to cost of sales, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses on the basis of headcount.
46 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options.
In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
A provision is made, calculated using the fair value of the Groups shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.
Employee share ownership plans The Companys ESOP is funded by loans from the Company, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
The Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP in its own accounts and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
Treasury shares Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to equity holders of the Company.
Investment income Investment income relates to interest income, which is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable Distributions to equity holders are not recognised in the income statement under IFRS, but are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a dividend when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised as a distribution when paid.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Segmental reporting The primary reporting format is based on business segments, comprising the Processor Division, the Physical IP Division and the Development Systems Division.
The secondary reporting format is based on geographical segments, these being Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
The primary reporting format requires segmentation of the Groups revenue and result before gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income and tax.
Segment expenses are expenses that are directly attributable to a segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can reasonably be allocated to the segment.
Foreign exchange gains or losses, gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income and tax are not segmented.
The primary reporting format also requires segmentation of the Groups assets and liabilities.
Segment assets and liabilities include items that are directly attributable to a segment plus an allocation on a reasonable basis of shared items.
Corporate assets and liabilities are not included in business segments and are thus unallocated.
At 31 December 2006 and 2005, these comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term marketable securities, tax-related and corporate prepaid expenses and other assets and the fair value of currency exchange contracts.
Any current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are also not included in business segments and are thus unallocated.
Forthcoming accounting standards At the date of approval of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: an amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements: capital resources, requiring disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about entities management of capital resources: a new accounting standard, IFRS 7, Financial instruments: disclosures.
This standard replaces IAS 30, Disclosures in bank financial statements, and the disclosure requirements in IAS 32, Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation, and locates in one place all disclosures relating to financial instruments.
The new requirements incorporate many of IAS 32s disclosures as well as additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the risks arising from financial instruments: IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment, which addresses the interaction between the requirements of IAS 34, Interim financial reporting, and the recognition of impairment losses on goodwill in IAS 36, Impairment of assets, and certain financial assets in IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, and the effect of that interaction on subsequent interim and annual financial statements: IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions, which clarifies how share-based payment charges should be calculated where employees of a subsidiary receive the shares of a parent.
IFRIC 11 also addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions involving two or more entities within one group: and a new accounting standard, IFRS 8, Operating segments, which supersedes IAS 14, Segmental reporting, under which segments were identified and reported on risk and return analysis.
Under IFRS 8, segments are reported based on internal reporting.
The directors expect that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in the future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements when they come into effect for periods after 1 January 2007.
2 Segmental reporting At 31 December 2006 the Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main business segments: Processor Division PD The Processor Division encompasses those resources that are centred around microprocessor cores, including specific functions such as graphics IP, fabric IP, embedded software and configurable digital signal processing IP.
Physical IP Division PIPD The Physical IP Division is concerned with the building blocks necessary for translation of a circuit design into actual silicon.
Development Systems Division DevSys The Development Systems Division is concerned with the tools and models used to create and debug software and system-on-chip SoC designs.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 47 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 2 Segmental reporting continued Following the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004, the Group had two reportable segments in 2005 namely PD and PIPD.
This was based upon the Groups internal organisation and management structure and was the primary way in which the board of directors were provided with financial information.
Whilst revenues were reported into four main revenue streams namely licensing, royalties, development systems and services, the costs, operating results and balance sheets were only analysed into the two segments.
In 2006, this structure and system of internal financial reporting to the board of directors was changed resulting in a third division, namely DevSys, becoming a separate reportable segment.
In 2005, the results of DevSys were reported within PD, but for ease of comparability, have been separated out in the comparatives below.
PIPD consists of the business stream previously undertaken by Artisan.
PD primarily comprises the legacy ARM products and services.
Recent acquisitions have been allocated to the various divisions as follows: Axys in 2004 to DevSys, Artisan in 2004 to PIPD, KEG and KSI in 2005 to DevSys, Falanx in 2006 to PD and Soisic in 2006 to PIPD.
Goodwill on each acquisition has also been allocated into these divisions, except for Artisan whereby this has been allocated between PD and PIPD.
There are no sales between the business segments.
Foreign exchange gains or losses, gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income and tax are unallocated.
Segment assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, inventories and receivables but exclude tax-related and corporate assets, current tax assets and deferred tax assets.

9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and treasury stock which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company had two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year: those being share options granted to employees and directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
For 2006 and 2005 no shares that were allocated for awards under the LTIP were included in the diluted EPS calculation as the performance criteria could not be measured until the conclusion of the performance period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are shown on the face of the income statement.

No impairment charge was recorded as a result of this annual impairment test.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs according to business segment.
The carrying amounts of goodwill by CGU at 31 December 2006 are summarised below: Development Processor Physical IP Systems Division Division Division Group 000 000 000 000 Goodwill relating to Artisan 97,440 305,496 402,936 Goodwill relating to Axys 6,221 6,221 Goodwill relating to KEG and KSI 5,507 5,507 Goodwill relating to Soisic 2,228 2,228 Goodwill relating to other acquisitions 11,443 31 11,474 108,883 307,724 11,759 428,366 The recoverable amount for each CGU has been measured based on a value in use calculation.
58 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 16 Goodwill continued Processor Division PD The Processor Division encompasses those resources that are centred around microprocessor cores, including specific functions such as graphics IP, fabric IP, embedded software IP and configurable digital signal processing DSP IP.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A ten-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2016 of 3% per annum.
It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisition of Artisan to the Processor Division are expected to accrue.
It is expected that it will take between four and seven years from acquisition before a meaningful proportion of ARMs larger semiconductor partners are licensing physical IP from the Group, with royalties being generated from these licences a further two to four years later, i. e. a total period of six to 11 years.
Forecast revenue growth Revenue is forecast to grow by an amount consistent with the Groups five-year plan as well as analysts expectations.
These have proved to be reliable guides in the past and the directors believe that these estimates are appropriate.
Revenue attributable to the benefits afforded by owning the PIPD unit The directors believe that revenue will accrue to the Processor Division as a result of the ownership of the Physical IP Division for the following reasons: the development of faster and more power-efficient microprocessors as a result of collaboration between PD and PIPD engineering teams.
This is expected to generate more PD licensing deals at higher prices: the potential for PD to win more microprocessor licensing business as a result of ARM being able to offer both processor and physical IP in-house: and the improvement in PD operating margins as a result of being able to transfer a number of engineering tasks to the Bangalore design centre acquired with Artisan.
Operating margins Operating margins have been assumed to remain consistent with current operating margins over the period of the calculation.
Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with ARMs estimated weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Processor Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.
It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisitions of Artisan and Soisic are expected to accrue.
It is expected that it will take between four and seven years from acquisition before the majority of ARMs larger semiconductor partners are licensing physical IP from the Group, with royalties being generated from these licences a further two to four years later, i. e. a total period of six to 11 years.
Forecast revenue growth Revenue is forecast to grow by approximately 20% in the first five years, falling to 7% by 2016 to reflect the uncertainty of forecasting revenues in the years further in the future.
In assessing the appropriate valuation of Artisan in 2004, the directors assumed revenue growth of approximately 20% per annum was achievable in the Artisan stand-alone business based on process geometry shrinks bringing more licensing opportunities across a broader range of foundries and based on the significant increase in the usage of Artisan IP in 2003 and 2004 which is yet to generate royalties.
Confidence in achieving revenue growth of 20% is underpinned by the expected increasing contribution from synergistic revenues in addition to the growth potential in the stand-alone business.
Licence revenues increased by 2% year-on-year in 2006, with the order backlog at the end of the year being approximately 20% up on the level at the beginning of the year.
During 2006, a significant proportion of engineering resource was deployed to accelerate the technology portfolio rather than working on the conversion of order backlog into short-term revenue.
The directors believe that this investment in the technology portfolio means a revenue growth of 20% is achievable.
Operating margins Operating margins are assumed to increase gradually over time with growth to the low-40s% by 2013.
In 2006, PIPDs operating margin was 28%, reflecting both flatter licensing revenues and additional R&D investment in order to accelerate the development of leading edge products.
This is expected to increase significantly in future years as licence revenues from leading edge products gather pace and royalties increase at effectively 100% margins.
Costs are expected to grow broadly in line with licence revenue growth.
This timescale is consistent with ARMs experience in developing the processor licensing and royalty model.
ARM has signed approximately 465 processor licences over the last 16 years with less than half of these yielding royalties thus far.
As royalty revenues are a function of cumulative licensing, royalty growth gathers momentum as the licensing base grows ARM processor royalties have increased from $38 million in 2002 to $164 million in 2006.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 59 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 16 Goodwill continued Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Physical IP business of approximately 10% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Physical IP Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
Development Systems Division The Development Systems Division is concerned with the tools and models used to create and debug software and system-on-chip SoC designs.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A five-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2011 of 3% per annum.
It is considered appropriate to use a five-year forecast period to properly reflect the weighted average period over which the benefits of the acquisitions of Axys, KEG and KSI are expected to accrue.
Operating margins Operating margins are assumed to grow by an amount consistent with the Groups five-year plan.
Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Development Systems Division of approximately 10% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Development Systems Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
Included within the net book value of other intangible assets at 31 December 2006 are significant amounts relating to intangibles that were acquired with Artisan in 2004.

20 Financial instruments Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate fluctuations in place at the year end since it has no loan financing, and as such no hedge accounting is applied.
Given the size of the Group, the directors have not delegated the responsibility for monitoring financial risk management to a sub-committee of the board.
The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the Groups finance department.
The department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and also sets out circumstances where it would be appropriate to use financial instruments to manage these.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 61 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 20 Financial instruments continued Currency risk The Groups earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while a significant proportion of its costs are settled in sterling.
The Group seeks to use currency exchange contracts and currency options to manage the US dollar sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and value of anticipated US dollar receipts which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts in comparison with its requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars.
The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using currency exchange contracts and currency options for the sale of US dollars as appropriate.
Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar cash receipts.
As the timing of large cash receipts cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group enters into currency exchange contracts which allow exercise between two dates, typically between three and four months from the invoice date.
In those cases where customers settle debts before the expiry of the currency exchange contract, the Group evaluates whether money market rates available for US dollar investments exceed those for sterling investments.
It then seeks to maximise its returns by remitting US dollars against currency exchange contracts at the beginning or end of the exercise period, depending on the prevailing money market rates for US dollars and sterling at the time.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $29,000,000 2005: $36,000,000 and potential exercisable currency options of $60,000,000 2005: $76,000,000.
The Group had $91,063,000 2005: $59,987,000 of accounts receivable denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities balances of $111,186,000 2005: $121,427,000.
Thus 56% 2005: 38% of the Groups US dollar current assets were not hedged by matching currency exchange contracts and currency options at the year end.
The Group does not qualify for hedge accounting, and all movements in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments are recorded in the income statement, offsetting the foreign exchange movements on the accounts receivable, cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities balances being hedged.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro.
The Group is also required to settle certain expenses in euros, primarily in its French, Belgian and German subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take out euro currency exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2006, the Group had 128,494,000 2005: 160,902,000 of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2006, 68% 2005: 77% of interest-bearing assets, comprising cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities, are at fixed rates and are therefore exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents and is therefore exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The proportion of funds held in fixed rather than floating rate deposits is determined in accordance with the liquidity policy below.
Other financial assets, such as available-for-sale investments, are not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk on available-for-sale investments.
As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for securities which are generally unlisted at the time of investment or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARMs funds.
The board of directors reviews holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group.
Funds for such ventures are strictly limited in order that the financial effect of any potential decline of the value of investments will not be substantial in the context of the Groups financial results.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the board of directors and such approval is limited to financial institutions with an AAA rating.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the board of directors.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities, such that highly liquid resources exceed the Groups projected cash outflows at all times.
Use of financial instruments External borrowings At 31 December 2006, the Group owed nil 2005: nil extending beyond one year from the balance sheet date.
The Group had no undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2006 2005: nil or during the financial year.

62 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 20 Financial instruments continued Short-term marketable securities There is a readily available market for these investments.
Unrealised gains and losses on these investments are recognised directly in equity via the revaluation reserve.
The Group recognises an impairment charge when the decline in fair value below cost is judged to be other than temporary.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value is 22,000 more than 2005: 30,000 less than cost with a corresponding amount being credited 2005: charged to equity as the decline is judged to be temporary.
Fair value of currency exchange contracts The fair value of currency exchange contracts is estimated using the settlement rates.
The estimation of the fair value of the asset in respect of currency exchange contracts is 439,000 at 31 December 2006 2005: liability of 1,708,000.
The increase in 2006 is due to the value and relative exchange rates of contracts outstanding compared to 2005.
The resulting gain or loss on the movement of the fair value of currency exchange contracts is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative expenses, as shown below: 2006 2005 000 000 Gain loss in income statement 2,147 3,382 Available-for-sale investments: investments in unlisted companies Those companies in which the Group has invested are early-stage development enterprises, which are generating value for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits.
The directors do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the Groups investments in unlisted companies carrying value at 31 December 2006: 1,970,000 as they are, by definition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities.
However, based on recent fundraising transactions by these companies and, where possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Available-for-sale investments: investments in listed companies The fair value of listed investments is determined with reference to prices quoted on the London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2006.
On this basis, the fair value of the Groups listed investments is 1,885,000 at 31 December 2006 2005: 6,995,000.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the Group has reviewed all its contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
From time to time, the Group enters into contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer or the collaborative partner.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative expenses, as shown below: 2006 2005 000 000 Loss gain in income statement 898 2,101 Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group, where required, invests profits in the subsidiary in which they were earned.
The Group does not hedge any foreign net asset investment using foreign currency loans, as there is currently no requirement for external borrowings.

Share repurchase transactions in respect of 49,500,000 shares carried out between 19 May 2006 and 31 December 2006 took place at a time when ARM Holdings plc Company only had no distributable reserves and accordingly such shares have not been properly acquired in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, and are not available for re-issue or cancellation.
ARM Holdings plc intends to make an application to the Court in due course to cancel these shares pursuant to a special resolution to be proposed at the 2007 AGM.
At 31 December 2006, a total of 49.5 million shares were held for future cancellation and 1.2 million within the ESOP.
These shares have a nominal value of 0.05 pence and represent 3.6% of called-up share capital at 31 December 2006.
23 Acquisitions Falanx Microsystems AS On 30 May 2006, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Falanx Microsystems AS Falanx, a graphics IP company incorporated in Norway for total consideration of 13.4 million, comprising 13.3 million cash consideration and 0.1 million of related acquisition expenses.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.
Falanx develops graphics accelerator IP and software for semiconductor system-on-chip SoC vendors that deliver high-quality multimedia images without compromising performance, power consumption or system cost.
The acquisition fits the ARM strategy of enabling users to create SOCs seamlessly in their design process.
The Mali Graphics Processor Unit GPU is a combination of hardware and software that enables industry-leading 3D graphics and video on mobile phones, portable media players, set-top boxes, handheld gaming devices and automotive systems, providing the Group with full control over the development of its future 3D graphics solutions.
For the reasons given above, combined with the ability to hire the entire workforce of Falanx and synergistic benefits that may arise, the Group paid a premium on the Falanx acquisition, giving rise to goodwill.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2006 the acquisition contributed nil to revenue, and incurred a loss of 1.5 million before both interest and tax.
The acquisition did not make a material contribution to the Groups post-acquisition net operating cash flows, tax paid and capital expenditure.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
The accounting for the Falanx acquisition has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2006 because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities have been determined only provisionally.
Any adjustments to these provisional values as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and will be recognised as if they had occurred as at the date of acquisition.

Falanx employs a number of unique pieces of software that have been internally developed, allowing them to be highly bespoke and continually adapted.
Internallydeveloped hardware technologies comprise the Mali family of graphics processors which are controlled by Falanx through numerous patents.
At the date of acquisition, both internally-developed software and hardware technologies were complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to ongoing maintenance of the technologies and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the internally-developed software the replacement cost approach was used with a post-tax discount rate of 14.9%.
To estimate the fair value of the internally-developed hardware, a discounted cash flow method, specifically the income approach, was used with a post-tax discount rate of 15.4%.
Developed technologies are being amortised over an estimated useful life of three to five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of 1.0 million represented the fair value of existing customer contracts.
To estimate their fair value, a discounted cash flow method, specifically the income approach, was used with reference to the terms of the contracts and managements estimates of the level of revenue which will be generated from the customer relationships.
A post-tax discount rate of 14.9% was used for the valuation.
Customer relationships are being amortised over an estimated useful life of three years.
Falanx made a loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 0.5 million and for the period from 1 January 2006 until acquisition made a loss after tax of 0.4 million.
The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of Falanx occurred on 1 January 2006.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 65 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 23 Acquisitions continued Soisic SA acquisition On 30 October 2006, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Soisic SA Soisic, a silicon-on-insulator SOI IP company incorporated in France for total consideration of 5.8 million, comprising 3.1 million cash consideration, 2.4 million contingent consideration and 0.3 million of related acquisition expenses.
With this acquisition, the Group is making an investment in new technologies related to physical IP to enhance its leadership position in providing customers access to the higher performance and lower power offered by SOI process technologies.
Soisic develops a similar set of products to the Physical IP Division, specifically standard cells, static random access memory SRAM compilers and input output I O cells, however, based on SOI design rules and process models.
Integrating this capability with ARMs widely-used physical IP opens the possibility for SoC designers to access SOI technology, which currently is used only in full custom designs, such as high-performance microprocessors.
The Group is investing in this area to be at the forefront of the design technologies needed to exploit the potential advantages of SOI as its usage grows in mobile, home and enterprise SoC and ASIC applications.
For the reasons given above, combined with the ability to hire the entire workforce of Soisic and synergistic benefits that may arise, the Group paid a premium on the Soisic acquisition, giving rise to goodwill.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2006 the acquisition contributed nil million to revenue, and incurred a loss of 0.2 million before both interest and tax.
The accounting for the Soisic acquisition has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2006 because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities have been determined only provisionally.
Carrying value Provisional pre-acquisition fair value 000 000 Receivables 273 273 Property, plant and equipment 117 117 Other intangible assets 4,283 Payables 1,415 1,415 Tax Current tax asset 303 303 Deferred tax asset 1,392 Deferred tax liability 1,413 Net liabilities assumed assets acquired 722 3,540 Goodwill 2,213 Consideration 5,753 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration paid including net debt of 22,000 1,843 Retentions 1,268 Contingent cash consideration 2,342 Expenses 300 5,753 Retentions represent consideration held back to cover possible future liabilities.
The contingent consideration will be determined based on Soisics future revenue in the first 1.5 years post-acquisition.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of Soisic is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid excluding net debt of 22,000 1,821 Expenses paid 300 Bank overdraft acquired 53 Net cash outflow 2,174 66 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 23 Acquisitions continued The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Soisic can be analysed as follows: 000 Developed technology 4,283 Total 4,283 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below: Developed technology Developed technology of 4.3 million represents primarily SOI wafers from 16nm up to 65nm.
At the date of acquisition the technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the technology and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the technology, a discounted cash flow method, specifically the excess profit method, was used with a post-tax discount rate of 30%.
Developed technology is being amortised over an estimated useful life of five years.
Soisic made a loss after tax for the year ended 31 March 2006 of 2.6 million and for the period from 1 April 2006 until acquisition made a loss after tax of 1.5 million.
The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of Soisic occurred on 1 January 2006.
PowerEscape Inc. On 21 June 2006, the Group purchased certain assets of PowerEscape Inc. a private company incorporated in the US, for total consideration of 0.6 million, comprising 0.5 million cash consideration and 0.1 million of related acquisition expenses.
The PowerEscape team, which has been integrated into the Groups Development System Division, will focus on adding innovative profiling and analysis features to the Groups portfolio of market-leading development tools.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2006 the acquisition did not make a material contribution to revenue, profit before interest nor profit before tax.
No goodwill has been recognised on this acquisition.
The accounting for the PowerEscape acquisition has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2006 because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities have been determined only provisionally.
Carrying value Provisional pre-acquisition fair value 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 11 Other intangible assets 992 Tax Deferred tax liability 397 Net assets acquired 1 596 Goodwill Consideration 596 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration paid 540 Expenses 56 596 The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of PowerEscape is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid 540 Expenses paid 56 Net cash outflow 596 The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of PowerEscape can be analysed as follows: 000 In-process research and development 992 Total 992 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 67 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 23 Acquisitions continued The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below: In-process research and development In-process research and development of 1.0 million reflects certain research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability.
The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was estimated using the discounted cash flow method with a post-tax discount rate of approximately 20%.
As part of the purchase agreement, the results of PowerEscape for the year ended 31 December 2005 and for the period from 1 January 2006 until acquisition are not disclosable in this annual report.
The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of PowerEscape occurred on 1 January 2006.
Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. acquisitions On 27 October 2005, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Keil Elektronik GmbH KEG, a leading provider of software development tools for the microcontroller MCU market and incorporated in Germany for total consideration 7.4 million.
On the same day, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Keil Software Inc. KSI, also a leading provider of software development tools for the MCU market and incorporated in the US for total consideration of 3.4 million.
These purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
The Group has identified the MCU market as a critical growth area for the Groups future business and with this acquisition, the Group will be able to accelerate progress in that market by offering a more complete solution.
As the MCU applications shift from 8 16-bit to 32-bit solutions, the combination of the ARM Cortex-M3 processor, which is ideally suited for microcontroller applications, the RealView high-performance compiler and Keils complementary MCU tools for ARM, will enable new generations of ARM MCU solutions.
For the reasons given above, the Group paid a premium on both the Keil acquisitions, giving rise to goodwill.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005 the acquisitions contributed 0.9 million to revenue, and 0.6 million to both profit before interest and profit before tax.

The contingent consideration will be determined based on KEGs future revenue in the first two years post-acquisition.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of KEG is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid 4,397 Expenses paid 263 Cash acquired 2,911 Net cash outflow 1,749 68 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 23 Acquisitions continued The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of KEG can be analysed as follows: 000 Developed technology 2,744 Customer relationships 4,290 Total 7,034 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below: Developed technology Developed technology of 2.7 million related to software development tools for the MCU market, consisting of 8-, 16- and 32-bit technology.
At the date of acquisition, the technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
To estimate the fair value of technology, the relief from royalty method within an income approach was used with a post-tax discount rate of 11%, with a specific surcharge of 5% for both the 8- and 16-bit technology and 3.4% for the 32-bit technology.
To derive the royalty cash flows, the revenues from each identified technology were used.
All developed technologies are being amortised over an estimated useful life of one to five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of 4.3 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts.
These have been divided into different customer groups: direct company customers and dealers.
To estimate the fair value of the customer base, the multi-period excess earnings method has been applied, with the valuation based on the planned free cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships as of the valuation date.
Direct company customers and dealers are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of two and three years respectively.
KEG made a profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 1.0 million and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a profit after tax of 1.0 million.
The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KEG occurred on 1 January 2005.
In 2006, 1.1 million was paid by the Group in respect of retentions.
KSI acquisition Carrying value Final pre-acquisition fair value 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 32 32 Receivables 174 174 Inventories 36 36 Plant, property and equipment 13 Other intangible assets 1,657 Payables 57 81 Deferred revenue 74 Tax Deferred tax liabilities 663 Net assets acquired 111 1,168 Goodwill 2,249 Consideration 3,417 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration paid 2,415 Retentions 373 Contingent cash consideration 497 Expenses 132 3,417 Retentions represent consideration held back to cover possible future liabilities.
The contingent consideration will be determined based on KSIs future revenue in the first two years post-acquisition.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of KSI is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid 2,415 Expenses paid 132 Cash acquired 32 Net cash outflow 2,515 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 69 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 23 Acquisitions continued The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of KSI can be analysed as follows: 000 Customer relationships 482 Tradenames 1,175 Total 1,657 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below: Tradenames Tradenames of 1.2 million represented the trade names and internet domain names legally held by Keil Software, Inc. To estimate the fair value of these tradenames, the relief from royalty method within an income approach was applied with a post-tax discount rate of 14.5%.
To derive the royalty cash flows, the revenues from KSI and KEG were used.
All tradenames are being amortised over an estimated useful life of five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of 0.5 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts.
These have been divided into different customer groups: direct customers and distributors.
Direct company customers and distributors are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of two and three years respectively.
KSI made a loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 95,000 and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a loss after tax of 40,000.
The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KSI occurred on 1 January 2005.
24 Share-based payments The Group has several share option schemes in current operation, whereby options over shares in the Company can be granted to employees and directors.
The different schemes are described below, but all options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant, except for those options within the SAYE schemes which are issued at a 15% discount.
Furthermore, from 2006, the Company has begun issuing RSUs to employees instead of options, as approved at the 2006 AGM.
RSUs are actual share awards on vesting rather than options to buy shares at a fixed exercise price.
Whilst the Company reserves the right to award options to employees going forward, the majority of awards to employees will be in RSUs.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan the Executive Scheme, the Company may grant options to employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Unapproved Scheme the Unapproved Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met are exerciseable after three years, otherwise they will become exerciseable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
In the French Scheme, options are exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
The main RSU awards to employees in all jurisdictions other than France vest similarly to the unapproved scheme above, namely 25% on each anniversary over four years.
RSU awards to our French employees vest 50% after two years, and then a further 25% after three and four years.
The fair value of our RSUs and LTIP awards is based on the share price at the date of grant, discounted for any dividends that wont be earned during the vesting period.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition.
The schemes remained substantially the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc.
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement.
The schemes assumed were the 1993 Plan, the 1997 Plan, the 2000 Plan, the 2003 Plan, the Director Plan, the Executive Plan and the ND00 Plan.
70 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 24 Share-based payments continued Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods.
The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years.
Some options vest on a monthly basis, and some vest over five years.
All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.
The Company also offers savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The number of options granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee.
The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM Inc. where the period is two years.
The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a sixmonth period once the savings have been completed except for ARM Inc. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed.
The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
As RSUs are share awards with no exercise price, all awards have been deemed to have an exercise price of 0.0000001 in the Black-Scholes model.
The following assumptions for each RSU grant during 2006 were as follows: Grant date 8 May 2006 8 May 2006 1 Sep 2006 1 Sep 2006 20 Nov 2006 Scheme RSU French RSU RSU French RSU RSU Share price at grant date 1.365 1.365 1.1875 1.1875 1.16 Number of employees 1,167 28 108 2 152 Shares awarded 6,282,180 164,292 623,402 2,852 890,676 Vesting period years 1-4 2-4 1-4 2-4 1-4 Expected volatility 40% 40% 40% 40% 40% Expected life years 1-4 2-4 1-4 2-4 1-4 Risk free rate 4.0% 4.0% 4.5% 4.5% 5.0% Dividend yield 0.7% 0.7% 0.7% 0.7% 0.7% Fair value per award 1.327-1.355 1.327-1.346 1.155-1.179 1.155-1.171 1.128-1.152 72 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 24 Share-based payments continued Grant date 20 Nov 2006 Scheme French RSU Share price at grant date 1.16 Number of employees 18 Shares awarded 189,445 Vesting period years 2-4 Expected volatility 40% Expected life years 2-4 Risk free rate 5.0% Dividend yield 0.7% Fair value per award 1.128-1.144 The expected volatility was primarily based upon historical volatility adjusted for past one-time events that are not expected to re-occur.
The expected life is the expected period to exercise.
A reconciliation of option and RSU movements over the year to 31 December 2006 is shown below.
Note that RSUs do not have an exercise price and thus only a reconciliation of the number of awards has been shown and not of their weighted average exercise price.

Nazomi filed suit against ARM alleging wilful infringement of Nazomis US Patent No.
ARM answered Nazomis complaint in July 2002 denying infringement.
ARM moved for summary judgment and a ruling that the technology does not infringe Nazomis patent.
The United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted ARMs motion, and Nazomi appealed the District Courts ruling.
In September 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal and issued its decision in April 2005.
Because, in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the District Court did not construe the disputed claim term in sufficient detail for appellate review, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the dispute back to the District Court for further analysis.
A supplementary Markman hearing was held in October 2005 to decide the construction of a fundamental term in the 215 Patent and a decision on claim construction was delivered on 6 September 2006.
The decision emphatically supports ARMs construction of the relevant term and consequently strongly supports ARMs non-infringement arguments.
In December 2006, ARM filed a renewed motion for summary judgment and a ruling that the accused technology does not infringe the 215 patent.
On 17 January 2007 Nazomi filed a response to ARMs renewed motion for summary judgment in which they stipulated that, based on the claim construction delivered by the District Court, the ARM technology accused in the suit does not infringe the 215 patent but also objected to the claim construction delivered by the District Court and indicated their intention to appeal the claim construction to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
On 30 January 2007, the District Court granted ARMs motion for summary judgment.
Furthermore, on 13 February 2007, Nazomi filed notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Based on independent legal advice, ARM is confident that the Court of Appeals will uphold the claim construction ruling delivered by the District Court in September 2006.
In October 2005, Technology Properties Limited, Inc. TPL filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Marshall Division, against certain companies in the Fujitsu, Matsushita, NEC and Toshiba groups of companies alleging infringement of TPLs US Patents Nos.
All of the defendants are licensees of various ARM technologies.
It was revealed as part of the preliminary infringement contentions in the Litigation, filed in July 2006, that certain ARM technology is alleged to infringe a single claim in US Patent No.
In September 2006 ARM filed a motion to intervene in the Litigation and that motion has been granted.
ARM is now a defendant party in the Litigation.
The claim construction or Markman hearing is scheduled for May 2007 and the trial date is scheduled for November 2007.
Based on legal advice and written opinions received from external counsel, ARM is confident that the accused ARM technology does not infringe any of the claims of the '584 Patent or that the patent is invalid.
ARM has voluntarily joined as a party to the Litigation to proactively defend its technology against ill-conceived and false infringement allegations and fully expects to prove the case for non-infringement or invalidity in the course of the Litigation.
ARM does not expect any significant liability in respect of these claims, except in relation to legal costs, for which 1.0 million has been accrued at 31 December 2006.
Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party.
Consistent with such practice, the Group provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Group to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Group to the licensee infringes such third partys intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the licence and will continue in perpetuity.
The Group does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: i information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements: and ii the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Any such provision is based upon the directors estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.
Contingent consideration Acquisition-related contingent consideration is disclosed in note 23.
74 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 28 Related party transactions During the year, the Group paid royalty fees of 124,000 2005: 33,000 and made cross-licence payments of nil 2005: 26,000 to Superscape Group plc Superscape, a company in which Mike Inglis, an executive director of the Group, is a non-executive director.
Amounts owed to Superscape at 31 December 2006 and 2005 were nil.
In addition, in 2006 the Group received royalty fees of 19,000 2005: 2,000 and licence fees of nil 2005: 11,000 from Superscape.
17,000 was owed by Superscape at 31 December 2006 2005: nil.

During 2006, the Group received funding for SOI technology development of 319,000 from SOI TEC Silicon On Insulator Technologies SA Soitec.
Soitec is an SOI IP company in which Doug Dunn, Group Chairman, is a non-executive director.
383,000 is owed by Soitec at 31 December 2006.
There were no other related party transactions during 2006 or 2005 which require disclosure.
Key management compensation is disclosed in note 4.
29 Post-balance sheet events After the year end, the directors declared payment of a final dividend in respect of 2006 of 0.6 pence per share.
Subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be paid on 21 May 2007 to shareholders on the register on 4 May 2007.
The final dividend has not been recognised as a distribution during the year ended 31 December 2006.
Following the year end, the UK Government announced a cut of 2% in the UK corporation tax rates for large businesses with effect from 1 April 2008.
Although not material, an adjustment to the Groups deferred tax assets will be required in 2007.
30 Summary of significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS Goodwill Under both IFRS and US GAAP, goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested at least annually for impairment.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Groups goodwill under IFRS has been frozen at the amount recorded under UK GAAP as at 1 January 2004.
Under US GAAP, following the provisions of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill was frozen at the amount recorded under previous US GAAP as at 1 January 2002.
Under both previous US GAAP and UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life.
Thus, while ongoing accounting policies in respect of goodwill are similar under US GAAP and IFRS, the difference in the dates of transition means that different amounts of goodwill are recorded.
Under US GAAP, certain costs to be incurred on restructuring on business combination are treated as a fair value adjustment in the balance sheet acquired.
Under IFRS, these costs are expensed post-acquisition.
Additionally, under US GAAP, tax benefits arising from the exercise of options issued as part of the consideration for a business combination become a deduction to goodwill, only to the extent that those benefits do not exceed the fair value of the consideration relating to those options at the appropriate tax rate.
Any excess tax benefits are a deduction to equity.
Under IFRS, the full tax benefit is a deduction to equity.
Where provisional assessments of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired on acquisition are refined, adjustments to fair values are recorded as prior year adjustments to goodwill under IFRS.
Under US GAAP, such revisions are recorded as amendments to goodwill in the subsequent year.
Recognition and amortisation of intangibles The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS retrospectively to business combinations occurring before 1 January 2004.
This means that for business combinations occurring before this date, the previously reported UK GAAP treatment has continued to be followed.
Under previous UK GAAP, intangible assets were recognised separately from goodwill only where they could be sold separately without disposing of a business of the entity.
This separability criterion does not apply under either IFRS or US GAAP.
Thus, a number of intangible assets which are required to be recognised separately from goodwill under both IFRS 3 and SFAS 142, were subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP.
Under both US GAAP and IFRS, such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives.
Except in relation to in-process research and development see below, there is no difference in accounting policy for intangible assets recognised as a result of business combinations entered into after 1 January 2004.
In-process research and development Under IFRS, in-process research and development projects purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IAS 38, Intangible assets, for recognition as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful economic lives commencing when the asset is brought into use.
Under US GAAP, in-process research and development is immediately written-off to the income statement.
This accounting policy difference gives rise to an associated difference in deferred tax.
Valuation of consideration on business combination Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the fair value of consideration in a business combination includes the fair value of both equity issued and any share options granted as part of that combination.
Under IFRS, any equity issued is valued at the fair value as of the date of completion, whilst under US GAAP, the equity is valued at the date the terms of the combination were agreed to and announced.
For options, under US GAAP, the fair value is based upon the total number of options granted, both vested and unvested, whilst under IFRS the fair value only includes those that have vested, together with a pro-rata value for partially vested options.
Furthermore, where there is contingent consideration for an acquisition, under IFRS this is recognised as part of the purchase consideration if the contingent conditions are expected to be satisfied, whilst under US GAAP it is only recognised if the conditions have actually been met, other than to the extent necessary to eliminate any potential negative goodwill under US GAAP.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 75 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 30 Summary of significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS continued Deferred compensation Under US GAAP, the intrinsic value of unvested share options issued by an acquirer as part of a business combination in exchange for unvested share options of the acquiree is recorded as a debit balance within shareholders funds.
This amount is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share options in accordance with FIN 28.
Under IFRS, no such adjustment to shareholders funds is made on acquisition.
Following the adoption of FAS No.
123 revised 2004 FAS 123 R, Share-based payment, the unamortised balance has been transferred to additional paid-in capital.
Compensation charge in respect of share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
In accordance with IFRS 2, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
Under US GAAP, the Group is required, effective as of 1 January 2006, to adopt FAS123 R. FAS123 R requires the Group to expense share-based payments, including employee share options, based on their fair value.
The Group has elected to utilise the modified prospective method of adoption, such that compensation cost is recognised beginning with the effective date i based on the requirements of FAS123 R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and ii based on the requirements of FAS123 R for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of FAS123 R that remain unvested on the effective date.
Some awards made by the Group are liability-classified awards under FAS123 R as either: i there is an obligation to settle a fixed monetary amount in a variable number of shares: or ii the award is indexed to a factor other than performance, market or service condition.
The fair value of these awards is remeasured at each period end until the award has vested.
Once the award has vested, or for i above when number of shares becomes fixed, the award becomes equity-classified.
In 2005 under US GAAP, the Group had elected to use the intrinsic value-based method to account for all its employee share-based compensation plans, under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations.
Thus no compensation expense was recorded in 2005 where the exercise price of the option was equal to the share price on the date of grant.
In 2005 under US GAAP, the Group recognised a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans.
The compensation charge was calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and was recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period.
In addition, certain options attracted a charge under variable plan accounting under US GAAP.
Under IFRS, this charge is calculated in the same manner as other share-based payments, as detailed above.
In 2005 under US GAAP, the Group followed variable plan accounting for the LTIP grants, measuring compensation expense as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at each period end over the vesting period of the options.
Increases in fair market value of the shares resulted in a charge and decreases in fair market value of the shares resulted in a credit, subject to the cumulative amount previously expensed.
Deferred tax on UK and US share options In the US and the UK, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount treated as employee compensation under US and UK tax rules on exercise of certain employee share options.
The compensation is equivalent to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognised and are calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Groups share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against the profit and loss reserve.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, no compensation charge is recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002 or in respect of those options which have been exercised or have lapsed before 31 December 2004.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets are recognised by multiplying the compensation expense recorded by the prevailing tax rate in the relevant tax jurisdiction.
Where, on exercise of the relevant option, the tax benefit obtained exceeds the deferred tax asset in relation to the relevant options, the excess is recorded in additional paid-in capital.
Where the tax benefit is less than the deferred tax asset, the write-down of the deferred tax asset is recorded against additional paid-in capital to the extent of previous excess tax benefits recorded in this account, with any remainder recorded in the income statement.
Employer taxes on share options Under IFRS, employers taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are provided for over the vesting period of the options.
Under US GAAP, such taxes are accounted for when the options are exercised.
Accrued legal costs Under IFRS, future legal fees that the Group is expecting to incur on current cases are accrued when the obligating event giving rise to the legal costs has occurred.
Under US GAAP, such costs are charged to the income statement in the period in which the costs are incurred.

The matters addressed in this operating and financial review and prospects, with the exception of the historical information presented, contain forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.
Overview ARM designs the technology that lies at the heart of advanced digital products, from wireless, networking and consumer entertainment solutions to imaging, automotive, security and storage devices.
ARMs comprehensive product offering includes 16 32-bit RISC microprocessors, data engines, graphics processors, digital libraries, embedded memories, peripherals, software and development tools, as well as analog functions and high-speed connectivity products.
The Company licenses this technology to semiconductor companies which, in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors and related products.
ARM has developed an innovative, intellectual property-centred and market-driven business model in which it neither manufactures nor sells the products incorporating ARM technology, but concentrates on the research and development, design and support of the ARM architecture and supporting development tools and software.
Combined with the Companys broad Partner community, they provide a total system solution that offers a fast, reliable path to market for leading electronics companies.
Market conditions 2006 was another year of healthy growth, approximately 10%, for the semiconductor industry as a whole, although it began to show signs of slowing by the end of the year.
Looking into 2007, we expect the industry to continue to be impacted by the inventory correction in the first half at least, but we believe that the effect on ARM will be attenuated and we expect to exceed the industry growth rate in 2007 as we have done in past years.
This is underpinned by a healthy technology portfolio of processor and physical IP, comprising both new and mature products.
The Company has remained both profitable and cash generative before investing activities.
On operating profits of 45.0 million, cash inflows from operating activities were 66.1 million, cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks of 88.9 million and a year-end cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balance of 128.5 million.
The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Year ended 31 December 2004 2005 2006 %% % Revenues: Product revenues 90.7 93.7 93.9 Service revenues 9.3 6.3 6.1 Total revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Product costs 4.4 9.4 9.1 Service costs 3.3 2.6 2.6 Total cost of revenues 7.7 12.0 11.7 Gross profit 92.3 88.0 88.3 Operating expenses: Research and development 33.0 26.5 28.7 Sales and marketing 15.8 15.6 16.8 General and administrative 20.2 17.7 18.5 In-process research and development 2.3 0.1 0.2 Amortization of intangibles purchased through business combination 0.4 7.5 7.0 Total operating expenses 71.7 67.4 71.2 Income from operations 20.6 20.6 17.1 Interest 4.5 2.3 2.6 Profit on disposal of available-for-sale security 2.0 Income before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting policy 25.1 22.9 21.7 Provision for income taxes 6.8 4.9 3.6 Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting policy 18.3 18.0 18.1 Cumulative effect of change in accounting policy, net of tax 0.9 Net income 18.3 18.0 17.2 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 79 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Total revenues Total revenues were 263.3 million, an increase of 13% from 232.4 million in 2005, which was an increase of 52% from 152.9 million in 2004.
Dollar revenues were $483.6 million in 2006, an increase of 16% from $418.7 million in 2005, which was an increase of 54% from $272.4 million in 2004.
The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2006 was $1.84 compared with $1.80 in 2005.
This had the effect of reducing total reported revenues by approximately 5.1 million.
The figures for 2004 do not include revenues for the Artisan business acquired in December 2004 now the Physical IP Division.
If these were included, dollar revenues increased by 18% in 2005 from the pro forma $355.5 million in 2004 of the combined ARM and Artisan businesses.
Product revenues Product revenues consist of license fees, sales of development systems and royalties.
Product revenues for 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 138.7 million, 217.7 million and 247.2 million, representing 91%, 94% and 94% of total revenues respectively.
License revenues increased from 59.4 million in 2004 to 104.2 million in 2005, and increased further to 110.6 million in 2006 representing approximately 39%, 45% and 42% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Processor Division PD dollar license revenues have grown by 19% and 12% in 2005 and 2006 respectively.
The portfolio of licensable products comprises a rich mix of proven ARM technology, such as the ARM7, ARM9 and ARM11 families of products and newer technology in the Cortex family of products.
Three Cortex products became available for general licensing during 2006.
65 new licenses were signed in 2006 compared to 71 in 2005 and 64 in 2004.
ARM11 accounted for 22% of PD license revenues in 2006, compared to 21% in 2005 and 17% in 2004.
Revenues from Cortex family products accounted for 26% of PD license revenues in 2006, compared to 16% in 2005.
Cortex products started generating revenue in 2005.
23 companies became new ARM Partners in 2006, bringing the total number of semiconductor partners to 188 at the end of 2006.
This total number of semiconductor partners was net of those companies that have signed licenses with ARM in the past but have since been acquired by other companies or who no longer have access to ARM technology for other reasons.
Having licensed Cortex family products to lead partners prior to 2006, the current portfolio of three Cortex family products became available for more general licensing as the year progressed.
During 2006, 13 Cortex family licenses were signed, bringing the accumulated total of Cortex family licenses to 23, signed by 18 semiconductor companies.
In addition, 2006 continued to be a year of strong licensing of the ARM11 family of products.
In the year, ARM signed 15 ARM11 family licenses, bringing the total number to 52 from 36 semiconductor companies.
2006 signified a shift in ARM11 family licensing activity from the traditional first-mover mobile companies with the majority of licenses being taken for applications outside of the mobile segment.
As part of the Cortex family licensing in 2006, ARM signed a lead partner agreement with a semiconductor company for the next-generation Cortex microprocessor.
This product is expected to become available for mainstream licensing in 2008.
License revenues from non-core products, covering items such as platforms, peripherals, embedded trace modules, embedded software, data engines, models and sub-systems were 10.9 million in 2006, compared to 11.1 million in 2005 and 10.5 million in 2004 representing approximately 14% of processor license revenues in 2006, 16% in 2005 and 18% in 2004.
In 2006 ARM maintained progress in achieving the long-term strategic goal of providing ARMs physical IP to leading Integrated Device Manufacturer IDM and Fabless semiconductor companies and continued to sign synergistic licenses that have been enabled by the combination of ARM and Artisan.
Synergistic deals include, in managements determination, both instances of physical IP being licensed to ARM Partners and instances of contracts being won against the competition due to both processor and physical IP being available from ARM.
Licensing momentum for ARMs 65nm physical IP products grew, with 12 new licenses signed in 2006.
By the end of 2006, ARM had signed a total of 25 65nm licenses with 10 companies and had signed seven licenses for physical IP with four Foundries at the most advanced process of 45nm.
ARMs Physical IP division PIPD reported license revenues of 34.9 million in 2006, representing approximately 31% of total license revenues.
During 2006 the combination of ARM and Artisan has continued to provide benefits other than synergistic license revenues.
In addition to the benefits to the Cortex range of processors, including the development of the new 12 track Advantage libraries in 65nm enabling higher performance, and the high-performance ARM1176JZF-S implementation, the combination has enabled the development of lower-power processors with lower leakage, a new compact ARM11 MPCore dual processor delivering greater performance at lower power and development work on 45nm physical IP which will influence and optimize the design of future processors.
80 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 Revenues from the sale of development systems increased from 19.7 million in 2004 to 25.6 million in 2005 to 28.8 million in 2006 representing approximately 13%, 11% and 11% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
This growth has been generated by working with customers on longer-term relationships for the supply of RealView Developer tools for software development, continued momentum behind the RealView Create tools for ESL customers and a healthy market place for tools to support the broad portfolio of ARM microprocessors.
Development Systems has entered into more multi-year contracts for larger product volumes which improves the visibility of business going forward and builds a good customer base from which to drive new innovation.
Royalties are either set as a percentage of the licensees average selling price ASP per chip or, less frequently, as a fixed amount and are recognized when the Company receives notification from the customer of product sales.
In effect, this means that it is normally in the quarter following the shipments that data is received and so royalty data for a year reflects actual shipments made from the beginning of October of the previous year to the end of September of the current year.
As the penetration of ARM technology-based chips grows across a wide range of end-market applications, the range of ASPs gets wider.
The average royalty rate ARR earned by ARM in any one reporting period is dependent on the mix of the ASPs of the chips shipped in that period.
In 2006, significant unit volume growth was driven by products which incorporate chips with lower ASPs including ultra low cost handsets, smartcards, microcontrollers and Bluetooth chips.
As a result, the ARR in 2006 was 6.7 cents compared to 7.9 cents in 2005.
Unit volume growth more than compensated for this reduction in ARR and dollar royalty revenues grew by 25% year-on-year.
Royalties increased from 59.6 million in 2004 to 87.8 million in 2005 and increased further to 107.8 million in 2006, representing 39%, 38% and 41% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Royalty revenues in 2006 comprised 88.7 million from PD and 19.1 million from PIPD.
PD volume shipments increased from 1,272 million units in 2004 to 1,662 million in 2005, with the increase in volumes coming from all market segments.
Total unit shipments in 2006 of 2,450 million represented an increase of 47% compared to 2005.
Unit shipments in the mobile segment grew by 50% year-on-year and in the non-mobile segments by 42%.
Growth in the non-mobile segments was achieved across a broad range of product applications including smartcards, microcontrollers, automotive, connectivity devices, hard disk drives and many others.
The Company expects royalty revenues to grow year-on-year although they may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
The total number of partners shipping ARM technology-based products at the end of 2006 was 76 after taking into account corporate activity within the ARM partnership.
29 companies are paying royalties for physical IP products at the end of the year.
PIPD royalties have grown in 2006, demonstrating the increased widespread use of ARM physical IP in chip designs.
Service revenues Service revenues consist of design consulting services and revenues from support, maintenance and training.
Service revenues increased from 14.2 million in 2004 to 14.7 million in 2005 and further to 16.1 million in 2006, representing 9%, 6% and 6% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Services revenues in US dollars, being the primary currency of revenues generated grew from $25.1 million in 2004 to $26.5 million in 2005 and $29.1 million in 2006.
Geographic analysis Operating in a global environment, the geographic destinations of the Companys revenues fluctuate from period to period depending upon the country in which its customers are located.
The pattern of revenues in 2006 was 42% of revenues coming from the US, 16% from Japan, 26% from Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, and 16% from Europe.
In 2005, revenues from the US represented 43%, Japan 18%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 25%, and Europe 14%.
In 2004, revenues from the US represented 51%, Japan 21%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 12%, and Europe 16%.
Product costs Product costs are limited to variable costs of production such as the costs of manufacture of development systems, amortization of our thirdparty technology licenses, cross-license payments to collaborative partners and time of engineers on PIPD projects.
Product costs were 6.7 million in 2004, 21.8 million in 2005 and 24.2 million in 2006, representing 4%, 9% and 9% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
The large increase in product costs in 2005 was as a result of the PIPD direct costs of revenue, namely the associated engineering time spent on revenue-bearing projects.
Approximately two-thirds of total product cost of sales were made up of development systems costs in 2004, with the balance comprising additional costs related to the costs of third-party licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners.
In 2005 and 2006, the proportion of development systems costs fell to approximately a quarter, PIPD direct costs approximately two-thirds and the balance third-party licenses and cross-license payments.
Product gross margin in 2006 was 90%, compared to 90% in 2005 and 95% in 2004.
Included within product costs in 2005 and 2006 are 2.5 million of deferred stock-based compensation relating to options assumed on the Artisan acquisition and 1.1 million of FAS 123R stock-based compensation following the adoption of this standard in 2006.
The Company does not currently expect a significant increase in product costs in 2007.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 81 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Service costs Service costs include the costs of support and maintenance services to licensees of ARM technology as well as the costs directly attributable to consulting work performed for third parties.
Cost of services increased from 5.1 million in 2004 to 6.1 million in 2005 and 6.7 million in 2006.
The gross margins earned on service revenues were approximately 64% in 2004, 59% in 2005 and 58% in 2006.
Whilst services revenues remained relatively flat in 2004 and 2005, costs have increased as the business invests more into the engineering departments, a proportion of which is allocated to services costs.
The margin in 2006 was slightly lower primarily due to US dollar foreign exchange rates having a greater impact on revenues than costs.
Research and development costs Research and development costs increased from 50.4 million in 2004 to 61.6 million in 2005 to 75.5 million in 2006, representing 33%, 27% and 29% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Costs in 2006 included 10.6 million of share-based compensation charges in accordance with FAS 123R and in 2004 and 2005 included 0.3 million and 1.6 million of deferred share-based compensation respectively, in accordance with previously applicable standards.
Excluding these charges, R&D costs were 33%, 26% and 25% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Continued investment in research and development remains an essential part of the Companys strategy since the development of new products to license is key to its ongoing success.
Total engineering headcount increased from 739 at the end of 2004 to 846 at the end of 2005 with the increases coming from organic growth predominantly in India but in all locations around the world, as well as from the Keil acquisitions.
Engineering headcount at the end of 2006 was 1,083 with the increases again coming predominantly from organic growth in India but also from the Falanx and Soisic acquisitions.
Staff costs increased in line with these headcount figures, but bonuses payable on the achievement of financial performance targets were paid in 2004 and 2006, with only a negligible amount payable in 2005.
Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenditure increased from 24.2 million in 2004 to 36.2 million in 2005 and was 44.2 million in 2006, representing 16% of total revenues in 2004, 16% in 2005, and 17% in 2006.
Costs in 2006 included 3.7 million of FAS 123R compensation charge and in 2004 and 2005 included 0.2 million and 2.1 million of deferred stock-based compensation.
The proportion of sales and marketing costs to revenue in 2004, 2005 and 2006 excluding these charges were 16%, 15% and 15% respectively.
Headcount in this area increased from 282 at the end of 2004 to 297 at the end of 2005, and was 337 at the end of 2006.
As the Company increases its technological portfolio, further investment has been made to strengthen customer support and after-sales service.
Staff bonuses fluctuated in each year as shown above.
General and administrative General and administrative headcount at 31 December 2006 was 239, up from 181 at the end of 2005 and 150 at the end of 2004.
The increases year-on-year have partly come from the acquisitions but also organic growth to strengthen the infrastructure of the Company as it continually expands.
General and administrative costs were 30.8 million in 2004, 41.1 million in 2005 and 48.6 million in 2006, representing 20%, 18% and 18% of total revenues respectively.
Excluding 0.4 million and 3.5 million of deferred stock-based compensation in 2004 and 2005 and 2.9 million of FAS 123R compensation costs in 2006, G&A costs were 20%, 16% and 17% of total revenues in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Litigation costs were 5.1 million in 2004, 0.4 million in 2005 and 0.8 million in 2006, fluctuations arising largely as a result of annual variations in the amount of legal expenses relating to patent protection cases and other similar costs.
4.5 million of these costs in 2004 related to a technology license agreement signed in the year.
Expense in relation to provisions for doubtful debts and write-offs were 0.9 million in 2006, 0.5 million in 2005 and a release of 0.3 million in 2004.
Unrealized future foreign exchange losses on certain committed but not yet invoiced future revenue streams of 0.9 million 2005: gains of 2.1 million: 2004: losses of 0.7 million were recorded in accordance with SFAS 133.
There was a loss on foreign exchange of 1.5 million and 2.3 million in 2004 and 2005 respectively and a gain of 3.6 million in 2006, mainly as a result of the revaluation of an intra-group dollar loan.

Other increases in 2006 over 2005 include additional recruitment and training costs for the net increase of 335 employees in the Company in the year, increased IT costs to continually develop the ARM internal network as the number of offices and people grow and increased administrative costs relating to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance work.
In-process research and development During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. now ARM Inc.. Those intangible assets that were still in development known as in-process research and development were charged directly to the income statement, amounting to 0.4 million and 3.2 million for Axys and Artisan respectively.
A further 0.3 million of Artisan in-process research and development was charged to the income statement in 2005 as the final valuation of intangibles was completed.
In 2006, the Company acquired certain assets of PowerEscape, resulting in 0.6 million of in-process research and development being charged to the income statement.
All acquired in-process research and development from the Axys, Artisan and PowerEscape acquisitions are progressing as expected with some still incomplete as at 31 December 2006.
82 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 Amortization of intangible assets Various licenses to use third party technology have been signed over the past several years, with their values being capitalized and amortized over the useful economic period that the Company is expected to gain benefit from them generally between three and five years.
Licenses totaling 5.9 million were purchased during 2001 to 2005 with amortization of these licenses amounting to 0.4 million in 2006 2005: 0.5 million: 2004: 0.5 million.
At 31 December 2006, the net book value of these assets was 0.6 million which will be amortized over the next three years.
Following the out-of-court settlement of the Companys litigation against picoTurbo, Inc. in December 2001, picoTurbo assigned its intellectual property rights to the Company for a payment of 7.5 million.
This has been amortized over four years and 1.5 million was charged to the income statement in 2002 and 2.0 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
The asset was fully written-down in 2005 and thus there was no further amortization charge in 2006.
The Company also purchased a patent for 0.7 million in 2002 which is being amortized over five years.
The amortization charge was 0.1 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
During 2003, the Company purchased Adelante Technologies NV now ARM Belgium NV.
Included with the assets purchased were 0.3 million of intangible assets comprising developed technology and customer relationships which are being amortized over five years and two years respectively.
The amortization charge for the assets during 2005 and 2004 was 0.1 million in each year, but was less than 0.1 million in 2006.
During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. now ARM Inc. Intangibles acquired and capitalized as part of these business combinations including developed and core technology, customer relationships and trademarks totaled 1.9 million and 70.9 million respectively and are being amortized over five years and between one and six years respectively see note 6 for further details.
The total charge during 2004 was 0.1 million and 0.3 million for Axys and Artisan respectively, during 2005 was 0.4 million and 16.5 million and during 2006 was 0.4 million and 14.6 million respectively.
During 2005, the Company purchased Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. Intangibles acquired and capitalized consisted of developed technology, customer relationships and tradenames and totaled 8.7 million.
These are being amortized between two and five years and the amortization totaled 0.4 million during 2005 and 2.5 million in 2006.
During 2006, the Company purchased Falanx Microsystems AS, a graphics IP company in Norway.
Intangibles acquired and capitalized consisted of developed technology and customer relationships and totaled 5.3 million.
These are being amortized over three to five years and the charge in 2006 was 0.7 million.
The Company also purchased Soisic SA, an IP company based in France and the US.
Intangibles acquired and capitalized were all developed technology and totaled 4.3 million.
This is being amortized over five years with 0.1 million being charged in 2006.
Interest Interest receivable decreased from 6.9 million in 2004 to 5.3 million in 2005, but increased in 2006 to 6.8 million.
The growth in interest in 2006 was due to higher average cash balances and increasing interest rates.
The fall in 2005 was a result of the cash outflow at the end of 2004 for the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company invested cash balances over periods of up to one year during 2006, although most were for periods less than six months.
Profit on disposal of available-for-sale security In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in CSR plc for cash proceeds of 5.6 million and realized a profit of 5.3 million.
The Company made no profit or loss on its disposal of a minority investment in Zeevo Inc. in 2005.
Income before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting policy Income before income tax was 38.5 million in 2004, 53.2 million in 2005 and 57.0 million in 2006, representing 25%, 23% and 22% of total revenues respectively.
The primary reason for the fall in margin in 2005 was due to acquisition-related charges in-process research and development of 0.3 million and 17.4 million of business combination intangible amortization and deferred stock-based compensation of 10.4 million.
The margin fell again in 2006 due to FAS 123R share-based compensation charges of 18.3 million, intangible amortization relating to business combinations of 19.0 million, increased investment throughout the business in additional headcount as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange with the weakening of the US dollar in the year.
Tax charge The Companys effective tax rates were 27.2% in 2004, 21.3% in 2005 and 16.5% in 2006.
The effective tax rate in 2004 was lower than the blended tax rates from the relevant tax jurisdictions due to additional costs being allowable for research and development tax credits, additional deferred tax credits arising from employee share options and some of the non-cash accounting charges being claimed in 2004.
It fell further in 2005 primarily as a result of benefits arising from the structuring of the Artisan acquisition, as well as increased benefits of research and development tax credits.
It fell further in 2006 due to a non-recurring tax credit arising from a tax-deductible foreign exchange loss and continued benefits from the structuring of the Artisan acquisition.
Cumulative effect of change in accounting policy On 1 January 2006, the Company adopted FAS 123R as detailed in the accounting for share-based payments section of the significant accounting policies in note 1.
The transitional rules detailed in FAS 123R require the Company to make a remeasurement adjustment for compensation cost for liability awards that has been recognized in the current year as a cumulative effect of change in accounting policy in the income statement.
The charge in the year, net of tax, was 2,447,000.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 83 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Liquidity and capital resources The Companys operating activities provided net cash of 46.5 million, 47.2 million and 66.1 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Accounts receivable increased by 1.4 million in 2004, 21.2 million in 2005 and a further 19.0 million in 2006.
This is partly due to the overall increasing revenues earned in the periods leading up to the end of the respective years but largely to do with timing of invoicing in the respective periods.
In the final week of 2006, there was significantly more invoicing to customers than in the final week of 2005 resulting in a large increase in receivables.
Despite this increase, days sales outstanding improved from 54 at 31 December 2005 to 43 at 31 December 2006.
Included within accounts receivable are amounts recoverable on contracts as discussed within deferred revenue below.
Prepaid expenses increased by 3.4 million in 2004 and fell by 1.4 million in 2005 and a further 0.5 million in 2006.
This increase in 2004 was due to a technology license agreement signed in the year under which amounts representing prepaid royalties will be released over the next several years.
The fall in 2005 and 2006 reflected this amortization.
There were no other significant movements within prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Accounts payable increased in 2004 by 1.2 million but fell by 1.9 million in 2005 and a further 0.7 million in 2006.
This is purely related to the timing of receipt of supplier invoices in the respective years.
Accrued liabilities increased by 2.8 million in 2004, fell by 5.6 million in 2005 and increased again by 2.1 million in 2006.
The increase in 2004 was as a result of provisions for staff costs and further payments on a technology license agreement signed in the year.
These fell in 2005 as payments on the technology license agreement were made and accrued employee compensation was lower in 2005 than in 2004.
Similarly, the main increase in 2006 was as a result of increased staff bonus and commission provisions following a record bookings quarter in the final quarter of 2006.
At 31 December 2006, the Company recorded approximately 31.5 million of deferred revenues which represented cash or receivables scheduled to be recognized as revenues in varying amounts after 31 December 2006.
At 31 December 2005, the Company recorded approximately 20.4 million of deferred revenues.
Deferred revenues are an element of customer backlog, and represent amounts invoiced to customers not yet recognized as revenues in the income statement.
Similarly, the Company recorded 23.8 million of amounts recoverable on contracts AROC at 31 December 2006, compared to 20.5 million at 31 December 2005.
AROC represents amounts that have been recognized as revenue in the income statement but are yet to be invoiced to customers.
Both deferred revenue and AROC fluctuate due to the maturity profile of ARMs products, and invoicing milestones within contracts.
The Company believes that, given its current level of business, it has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow from operations has been used to fund the working capital requirements of the Company as well as capital expenditure.
Cash outflows from capital expenditure in 2006 was 8.6 million, compared with 6.1 million in 2005 and 5.3 million in 2004.
Capital expenditure increased in 2005 and 2006 with staff levels increasing and general operational assets being replaced.
In 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capitals of Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. for total consideration of 6.9 million and 481.7 million respectively, with cash consideration comprising 6.9 million and 122.3 million respectively.
Cash acquired with these businesses amounted to 82.7 million.
In 2005, the Company made final payments relating to acquisition costs for Artisan of 14.4 million, as well as 1.7 million of contingent consideration from the Axys acquisition as a result of performance conditions being achieved.
A further 4.3 million net of cash acquired was paid for the acquisitions of Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc.
In 2006, the Company acquired both Falanx Microsystems AS and Soisic SA for cash consideration paid in the year of 13.4 million and 2.1 million respectively.
Further payments of 1.3 million for Soisic were made in early 2007, and additional amounts will become payable on the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones.
Additionally in 2006, a further 1.1 million was paid for Keil acquired in 2005 and 0.6 million for certain assets of PowerEscape.
The Company envisages making further strategic investments in the future, in situations where the Company can broaden its product portfolio, where it can obtain skilled engineering resources and where the potential for furthering ARM core-based design wins is improved significantly.
In 2004, the Company invested a total of 0.2 million in two small unlisted companies, Zeevo Inc. and Reciva Limited, giving a minority holding of less than 3% in both companies.
The investment in Zeevo Inc. was sold in 2005.
In 2005, 0.3 million was invested via convertible loan notes in Luminary Micro Inc. a small unlisted company.
A further 0.2 million was invested in Luminary in 2006.
The Company sold its investment in CSR plc in 2006 for 5.6 million.
84 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 During 2005, the Company initiated a share buyback program to supplement dividends in returning surplus funds to shareholders and this was continued in 2006.
During 2005, the Company bought back over 13.9 million shares at a total cost of 16.2 million.
During 2006, the Company bought back 63.6 million shares at a total cost of 76.5 million.
Dividends totalling 12.4 million were also paid to shareholders during the year 2005: 10.4 million: 2004: 9.0 million.
See the Companies Act 1985 section of the significant accounting policies within note 1 for further information on the share buybacks and dividends paid in 2006.
Share option exercises in 2006 gave rise to 17.9 million cash inflow to the Company compared to 13.9 million in 2005 and 1.3 million in 2004.
Cash, cash equivalents, shortand long-term investments and marketable securities balances at 31 December 2006 were 128.5 million compared to 160.9 million at 31 December 2005 and 142.8 million at 31 December 2004.
Foreign currency fluctuations The Companys earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US dollar rate, reflecting the fact that most of the Companys revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars while a high proportion of its costs are in sterling.
The Company reduces this US dollar sterling risk where possible by currency hedging.
Due to the high value and timing of receipts on individual licenses and the requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars, the Company reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a  basis.
It then hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars, which are negotiated with major UK clearing banks.
The average size of each forward contract was $5.1 million in 2004, $4.3 million in 2005 and $3.9 million in 2006.
The Company also uses currency options as a further translation instrument for limited proportions of its dollar exposure.
The fair values of the financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2004, 2005 and 2006 are disclosed in note 15 to the financial statements.
The settlement period of the forward contracts outstanding at 31 December 2006 is between 9 January 2007 and 22 March 2007.
The settlement period of the option contracts outstanding at 31 December 2006 is between 16 January 2007 and 18 December 2007.
Quantitative and qualitative information on market risk During the preceding fiscal year, the Company was exposed to foreign currency exchange risk inherent in its sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling.
ARM transacts business in approximately eight foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to the Companys operations were the US dollar, the Indian rupee, the euro and the Japanese yen for 2006.
For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies, predominantly US dollars, and therefore benefits from a weaker sterling and is adversely affected by a stronger sterling relative to those foreign currencies.
The Company has performed a sensitivity analysis at 31 December 2006, 2005 and 2004, using a modeling technique that measures the changes in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to sterling with all other variables held constant.
The analysis covers all of the Companys foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures.
The foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at 31 December 2006, 2005 and 2004.
The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of ARMs foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, net of exposures, of 8.9 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 3.9 million, 2004: 8.6 million.
Risk factors The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
The Company believes that its future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors.
These include the timing of entering into agreements with new licensees, the mixture of license fees, royalties and fees from services, the introduction of new technology by the Company, the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems companies of ARM core-based microprocessors from the Companys semiconductor partners and sudden technological change in the microprocessor industry.
Other risks include the reliance on semiconductor partners, dependence upon systems companies, patent protection, attraction and retention of employees, management of growth, competition and vulnerability to general economic conditions.
Risk factors are more fully discussed in the Companys annual report on Form 20-F.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 89 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies The business of the Company ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies ARM or the Company design reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors, physical IP and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-efficiency of high-volume embedded applications.
The Company licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard processors ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
By creating a network of Partners, and working with them to best utilize the Companys technology, the Company is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including smart cards and digital video.
The Company also licenses and sells Development Systems products direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers.
The Companys principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
The Company was formed on 16 October 1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer UK Limited, and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc.
Group undertakings include ARM Limited incorporated in the UK, ARM Inc. incorporated in the US, ARM KK incorporated in Japan, ARM Korea Limited incorporated in South Korea, ARM France SAS incorporated in France, Soisic SA incorporated in France, acquired during 2006, ARM Belgium N. V. incorporated in Belgium, ARM Germany GmbH incorporated in Germany, Keil Elektronik GmbH incorporated in Germany, ARM Norway AS incorporated in Norway, acquired and renamed during 2006, ARM Embedded Technologies Pvt Limited incorporated in India, ARM Physical IP Asia Pacific Pte.
Limited incorporated in Singapore, ARM Taiwan Limited incorporated in Taiwan and ARM Consulting Shanghai Co. Limited incorporated in PR China.
Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
The Company maintains its accounting records and prepares its financial statements in UK sterling.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
Investments Publicly traded investments are classed as available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
115, Accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, in other comprehensive income.
Other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized gains and losses of such securities are reported in earnings.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at cost less permanent diminution in value: at 31 December 2006 and 2005, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated their recorded basis, based on estimates determined by management.
In 2005, the Company made an investment by way of convertible loan notes in Luminary Micro Inc. which have now converted into preference shares further investment in 2006 has been made in Luminary Micro Inc. by way of preference shares.
Intangible assets Purchased patents and licenses to use technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them.
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, management is primarily responsible for determining the fair value of intangible assets.
Such assets are capitalized and amortized over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them, with the exception of in-process research and development which is written off immediately.
90 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired.
Prior to 2002, purchased goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company was expected to benefit from it.
Upon adoption of SFAS 142, on 1 January 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill.
The value of goodwill carried forward at the end of 2001 has been frozen at 2,274,000.
This goodwill together with goodwill arising on acquisitions since 2002, is tested for impairment at least annually.
An annual impairment review in 2006 determined, primarily with reference to cash flow forecasts, that there was no indication of impairment with respect to goodwill.
The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based on assumptions about expected future operating performance.
The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.
In accordance with SFAS 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company has identified its operating segments based on the information used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in monitoring the business.
For the purposes of assessing the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to reporting units.
Based on the nature and extent of discrete information available to management, the Company believes that, for ARM, each operating segment consists of a single reporting unit.
Goodwill has been allocated to the three reporting units as shown in note 9.
Impairment charges The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
It also reviews long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment if an event occurs that indicates that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss would be recognized, and the assets would be written down to their estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements with customers to enable them to use the Companys intellectual property IP, which is customized to each customers manufacturing process.
The Company receives royalties on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
It also supplies off-the-shelf software tools, bought-in boards and toolkits, training and consultancy services.
The Company primarily earns revenues from licensing its IP to leading electronics companies which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, ASICs and ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
The Companys IP consists of software and related documentation which enables a customer to design and manufacture microprocessors and related technology and software.
Most licenses are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer and are generally not time limited in their application.
In general, the time between the signing of a license and final validation of the customers ARM technology-compliant product is between six and 15 months.
Upgrades or modifications to the licensed IP are not provided.
Following validation of the customers ARM technology-compliant product, the Company has no further obligations under the license agreement.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, Accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production type contracts, when license agreements include deliverables that require significant production, modification or customization, contract accounting is applied.
Revenues from license fees are recognized based on the  method over the period from signing of the license to validation of the customers ARM-compliant product and the completion of all outstanding obligations.
The amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the license agreement, or that portion of the total license fees which is determined to be fixed or determinable in arrangements involving extended payment terms and the  achieved.
Those amounts that are not deemed fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement are recognized as the payments become due.
Where an arrangement is for multiple elements, each requiring significant production, modification or customization, the Company evaluates whether the bifurcation criteria of SOP 81-1 are met, and if so, the total arrangement fee is allocated accordingly.
The  is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project, compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Revenues are recognized only when collectability is probable.
Estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization, delivery and validation of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
Agreements that include rights to unspecified products as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognized over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 91 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued In accordance with SOP 97-2, Software revenue recognition, where agreements involve multiple elements that do not require significant production, modification or customization, the Company recognizes license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been shipped or electronically delivered, the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.
Where agreements include multiple elements, the revenue recognition criteria for each element are typically met within the same accounting period, i. e. on delivery of the elements.
If an element is undelivered at a period end, the Company determines whether it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value in order to make an allocation amongst the elements.
For the majority of its products and services, with the exception of post-contract support PCS, certain Development Systems products and certain services undertaken by the Company, the Company does not believe it has sufficient VSOE of fair value to make such allocations.
Accordingly, no revenue is recognized on an arrangement where deliverables other than PCS and the aforementioned Development Systems products and services remain undelivered.
License fees are considered fixed or determinable if they are not dependent on customers completing specific milestones and they are not subject to extended payment terms, i. e. the payment terms do not extend over a substantial period when compared to the payment terms in similar license arrangements and when compared with the licensed products life cycle.
If all the fees in an arrangement are deemed to be fixed or determinable, the Company recognizes revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
The excess of revenue recognized in respect of such fees over fees invoiced is recorded as an accrued revenue asset.
Where an arrangement includes fees that are not deemed fixed or determinable, revenue from the arrangement is recognized as the payments become due and the excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
PCS consists of the right to receive services and or unspecified product upgrades enhancements that are offered on a  basis.
PCS is generally priced separately from the initial licensing fee in a contract and revenue is allocated to PCS based on VSOE of fair value.
VSOE of fair value is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates.
If no renewal rates are specified, the entire fee under the arrangement is amortized and recognized ratably over the contractual PCS period.
Where renewal rates are specified, PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the PCS arrangement.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Company and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licenses to the product.
In those cases where the Company makes sales of these products and considers itself to be the principal under EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the total value of the license is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Company records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
Sales of boards and toolkits are recognized upon delivery.
While some arrangements with distributors provide very limited rights of return, the Companys history is that actual returns are negligible and accordingly no provisions are deemed necessary.
Services, such as consulting and training are typically sold in stand-alone arrangements.
Where they are sold in conjunction with other deliverables and they are not considered essential to the functionality of those other deliverables, they are accounted for separately based on VSOE, if VSOE has been established.
Revenue for these services is recognized as the services are performed and collectability is probable.
If VSOE for the services does not exist or the services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other deliverables in the arrangement, the entire arrangement fee is recognized as the services are performed.
The excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
Revenues from consulting projects, which are typically of a short duration, are recognized when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For longer term and more complex consulting projects, typically containing several project milestones, where significant modification to ARM core-based IP is required, revenues are recognized on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
This method approximates to  based on labor inputs.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognized when the Company receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties.
Notification is typically received in the quarter following shipment of product by the customer.
Where the Company enters into more than one agreement with the same customer in the same, short time frame, an assessment is made to establish whether the group of agreements is so closely related that they effectively form a single multiple-element arrangement.
The factors considered in making this assessment include, but are not limited to: whether the different elements are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of design, technology, or function: whether the fee for one or more of the agreements is subject to a refund or forfeiture or other concession if one of the other contracts is not completed satisfactorily: whether one or more elements in one agreement are essential to the functionality of an element in another agreement: whether payment terms under one agreement coincide with performance criteria of another agreement: and whether the negotiations are conducted jointly with two or more parties to do what in essence is a single project.
92 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Research and development All ongoing research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Costs include salaries of engineers and associated staff, relevant EDA tools costs and other directly related expenditure, such as contractors, as well as an allocation of facilities costs.
The facilities costs for each office are allocated according to the proportion of employees in engineering functions within these offices.
Any collaborative agreements whereby a third party agrees to partially fund the Companys research and development is recognized over the period of the agreement as a credit within research and development costs.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are receivable from the European Commission, a European organization which funds certain research and development activities on application to it for the purposes of furthering research and development activities within the European Union.
The Company retains significant rights to IP developed under projects which are funded under these arrangements.
Grants received are typically intended to cover 50% of expected project costs.
Grant income is recognized over the period of the project in line with the costs incurred.
Unconditional undertakings have been received from the European Commission to provide the funding, and there is no obligation to refund any amounts already received.
Amounts receivable under these arrangements in the year ended 31 December 2006 were 467,000 2005: nil: 2004: 338,000 and were netted against related research and development costs.
Pension costs The Company contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The Company contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
The amount of contributions expensed by the Company for the years ended 31 December 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 2,067,000, 3,371,000 and 3,840,000 respectively.
Loss contingencies The Company accrues an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Fair value of financial instruments The Companys financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities, accounts receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts.
The Company believes all of the financial instruments carrying values approximate to fair value due to their nature and respective durations.
Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and marketable securities The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year to be either short-term investments when invested on deposit with major clearing banks or short-term marketable securities when custodied with major financial institutions.
Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable securities.
Allowance for doubtful debts Allowance is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Property and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed into operational use, are capitalized.
External costs and internal costs are capitalized to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the business.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three to five years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of property and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 93 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Currency translation The Companys functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Statements of income of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the year.
Translation differences are taken to the cumulative translation adjustment.
The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts and currency options to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Companys forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
Because the Company does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the forward and option contracts and the related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
All recognized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative costs in the income statement.
The fair value of derivative instruments are disclosed within either prepaid expenses and other assets or accrued liabilities on the balance sheet and within net cash provided by operating activities in the cash flow statement.
The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences have been included in general and administrative costs.
From time to time, the Company enters into contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Company nor the functional currency of the customer.
In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, where there are unpaid amounts on such contracts, the Company carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement under general and administrative costs.
Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized.
The Company applies the with and without approach with respect to the allocation of net operating losses and other reliefs due to share-based compensation costs.
Under this approach a benefit is recorded in additional paid-in capital only to the extent that the amount of available net operating losses generated for operations can be offset against the current year taxable income.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by including potential common shares where the effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2006 excludes incremental shares of approximately 33,390,000 2005: 39,614,000: 2004: 38,143,000 related to employee stock options.
These shares are excluded due to their antidilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
The ordinary equivalent shares for share options were determined using the treasury stock method.
Accounting for share-based payments On 1 January 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No.
Under FAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period.
The fair value of these awards is calculated using appropriate valuation techniques.
Some awards made by the Company are liability-classified awards under FAS 123R as i there is an obligation to settle a fixed monetary amount in a variable number of shares: or ii the awards are indexed to a factor other than performance, market or service condition.
The Company adopted the provisions of FAS 123R using a modified prospective application.
Accordingly, prior periods have not been revised for comparative purposes.
The valuation provisions of FAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date, which are subsequently modified or cancelled.
Estimated compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under FASB Statement No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123.
94 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued On 10 November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.
FAS 123 R -3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.
The Company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to FAS 123R.
The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies which could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of FAS 123R.
For a summary of all the Companys share-based award schemes, please refer to the Shareholders equity section in footnote 12.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based payments.
This model is consistent with that used for the Companys pro forma information required under FAS 123.
The determination of the fair value using this model is affected by the share price at grant, as well as a number of other assumptions including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
The Company used the historical price of the Companys stock for the expected volatility assumption, including some adjustments for non-recurring one-time events, consistent with the guidance in FAS 123R and the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
Adjustments were made as the Companys assessment of future stock price trends were more representative of historical data excluding these events rather than including them.
The expected life of options is based on known vesting dates and historical exercise patterns for the different schemes.
The risk-free interest rate is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the share options.
The dividend yield assumption is based on our last declared dividend and expected payouts.
The fair value of our restricted stock units and LTIP awards is based on the share price at date of grant, discounted for any dividends that wont be earned during the vesting period.
The per share fair values of share options granted have been estimated with the following weighted average assumptions: Options RSUs LTIP awards 2004 2005 2006 2004 2005 2006 Expected life in years 3.34 3.07 3.11 3.00 3.00 2.57 Volatility 90% 50% 40% 85% 50% 40% Risk-free interest rate 4.05% 4.00% 4.01% 4.5% 4.00% 4.13% Dividend yield 0.51% 0.70% 0.70% 0.70% 0.70% 0.70% Weighted average fair value 0.74 0.38 0.43 1.01 1.17 1.31 The following table presents details of the total stock-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item of the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended 31 December: Note that the 2004 and 2005 comparable income statements have been re-analyzed to absorb the stock-based compensation expenses into the functional line items rather than as a separate line as reported in the income statements in those years.

In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys consolidated statements of income for 2005 and 2004 have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of FAS 123R.
The cumulative effect of change in accounting policy arises as a remeasurement adjustment for liability-classified awards on cumulative share-based compensation for earlier years on adoption of FAS 123R.
Included within tax benefits above is 1,049,000 relating to this cumulative effect of change in accounting policy.
The adoption of FAS 123R will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Companys reported results of operations, although it should not have a material impact on its overall financial position.
The amount of unearned stock-based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in the period from 2007 to 2011 related to unvested share-based payment awards at 31 December 2006 is 19.5 million.
Of this amount, 11.8 million is estimated to be expensed in 2007, 5.6 million in 2008, 1.7 million in 2009 and 0.4 million in 2010.
The weighted average period over which the unearned share-based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.0 years.
If there are any cancellations or accelerated vestings, the Company may be required to accelerate or cancel some of the remaining compensation expense.
The share-based compensation expense in future periods will be more than stated above to the extent that the Company grants additional options or awards after the balance sheet date.
Furthermore, the estimated future compensation charge may be affected by any change to the fair value of liability-classified awards.

During 2006, to supplement the payment of dividends to shareholders, the Company continued its rolling share buyback programme under the shareholder authority conferred at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The quantum and frequency of share repurchases is not predetermined and will take into account prevailing market conditions, the shortto medium-term cash needs of the business and the level of employee share-based remuneration going forward.
Whilst shares repurchased from the market have been used to satisfy some employee share option exercises, all those shares held at the end of 2006 are expected to be canceled in 2007.
See the Companies Act 1985 section below for further information on these share buybacks and need for subsequent cancellation.
The ESOP was set up on 16 April 1998 to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees.
Under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan, 7,771,416 shares could be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and treasury stock held by the Company.
All costs relating to the schemes are recognized in the income statement as they accrue and the ESOP has waived the right to receive dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.
For the purpose of earnings per share calculations, the shares are treated as canceled until such time as they vest unconditionally.
The Company also has a QUEST which was established to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company.
Following the final allocations in 2005, the QUEST held no further shares in the Company and is in the process of being wound-up.
Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options issued to employees in certain tax jurisdictions.
In accordance with EITF 00-16 no provision has been made for the employers taxes on these share options.
These amounts are recognized in the consolidated income statement when payable.
Recently issued accounting standards In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation FIN No.
48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesAn Interpretation of FASB Statement No.
This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements.
FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements.
It also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties.
FIN 48 will also require significant additional disclosures.
This Interpretation will be effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2006.
We will implement this Interpretation in the first quarter of 2007 on a prospective basis.
We are currently evaluating the potential impact this Interpretation will have on our financial position and results of operations.
96 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, which provides guidance on how to measure assets and liabilities that use fair value.
SFAS 157 will apply whenever another US GAAP standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances.
SFAS 157 will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after 15 November 2007.
We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard may have on our financial position and results of operations, but do not believe the impact of the adoption will be material.
In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No.
108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108.
SAB 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice in how public companies quantify misstatements of financial statements, including misstatements that were not material to prior years financial statements.
We have applied the provisions of SAB 108 in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the impact on our financial position and results of operations was not material.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No.
Part of this Statement was effective as of 31 December 2006, and requires companies that have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to recognize the funded status of those plans on the balance sheet on a prospective basis from the effective date.
The funded status of these plans is determined as of the plans measurement dates and represents the difference between the amount of the obligations owed to participants under each plan including the effects of future salary increases for defined benefit plans and the fair value of each plans assets dedicated to paying those obligations.
To record the funded status of those plans, unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial losses experienced by the plans will be recorded in the Other Comprehensive Income OCI section of shareholders equity on the balance sheet.
This does not have a material impact on our financial position.
On 12 September 2006 the EITF issued the statement EITF 06-2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits.
This becomes effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2006.
The EITF was issued to clarify the issue of when to make accruals for the provision of sabbaticals by the Company.
We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard may have on our financial position and results of operations, but do not believe the impact of the adoption will be material, other than the adjustment for cumulative effect of change in accounting policy.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.
159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No.
Under this standard, entities will now be permitted to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an  basis the fair value option.
The fair value option represents a significant step in the evolution of financial reporting because it considerably expands the ability of entities to select the measurement attribute for certain assets and liabilities.
FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 November 2007.
We are currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on our financial position and results of operations.
Companies Act 1985 These financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 of Great Britain the Companies Act.
The Companys statutory accounts, which are its primary financial statements, are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs for consolidated accounts and accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP for ARM Holdings plc company only accounts.
They are prepared in compliance with the Companies Act and are presented in pounds sterling.
Statutory accounts upon which the auditors gave unqualified reports under Section 235 of the Companies Act and which did not contain statements under sub-sections 237 2 and 3 of the Companies Act for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2005 have been, and those for the year ended 31 December 2006 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales.
Dividends are required to be declared in sterling out of profits available for that purpose as determined in accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act.
Substantially the whole of the Companys distributable reserves are generated in ARM Limited, a subsidiary within the ARM Holdings plc group.
The amount of distributable reserves in ARM Limited at 31 December 2006 was 166 million.
However, it came to the attention of the directors in February 2007 that the distributable reserves of ARM Holdings plc company only, which are required to fund both the share buyback programme and dividends, had been fully utilized by 19 May 2006 although sufficient distributable reserves were available in ARM Limited.
Accordingly, 49.5 million of the shares acquired by the Company in 2006 and a further 6.2 million shares acquired in early 2007 were acquired at a time when ARM Holdings plc had insufficient distributable reserves.
Had the board been aware of the shortfall in distributable reserves in ARM Holdings plc at the relevant time, it would have arranged for the payment of a dividend to ARM Holdings plc from ARM Limited to cover the shortfall.
As a result of the shortfall in distributable reserves, the relevant shares have not been properly acquired under the applicable statutory requirements, and so ARM Holdings plc is unable to re-issue such shares or cancel them.
ARM Holdings plc has been advised that this matter should be resolved by cancelling the relevant shares by Court order.
A similar issue has arisen in relation to the interim dividend for 2006 which was paid to shareholders on 6 October 2006.
At that time, ARM Holdings plc did not have sufficient distributable reserves to make such a payment, being approximately 5.5 million in aggregate although sufficient distributable reserves were available in ARM Limited.
This amounts to a technical breach of the statutory requirements.
A dividend from ARM Limited to ARM Holdings plc via an intermediary holding company was paid on 21 February 2007 and the directors have filed with the Registrar of Companies accounts for ARM Holdings plc as at 22 February 2007 reflecting such dividend.
This resolves the position regarding ARM Holdings plcs distributable reserves with regard to the final dividend for 2006 and the Companys share buyback programme.

nil 2005: nil was owed to Superscape at 31 December 2006.
Also during 2006, the Company received license fees of 3,085,000 2005: 321,000: 2004: 209,000, support and maintenance income of 37,000 2005: 37,000: 2004: 37,000 and evaluation tools fees of 82,000 2005: 17,000: 2004: nil from CSR plc, a company in which John Scarisbrick is an executive director.
During 2006, the Company received funding for SOI technology development of 319,000 from SOI TEC Silicon On Insulator Technologies SA Soitec.
Soitec is an SOI IP company in which Doug Dunn, Company Chairman, is a non-executive director.
Such benefits are reflected as additional paid-in capital.
Also included in the provision for income taxes is utilization of the deferred tax liability in relation to acquired intangibles of 6,264,000 2005: 6,921,000: 2004: 188,000.
Total income tax expense differs from the amounts computed by applying the UK statutory income tax rate of 30% for 2006, 2005 and 2004 to income before income tax as a result of the following: Year ended 31 December 2004 2005 2006 000 000 000 UK statutory rate 30% 2005: 30%: 2004: 30% 11,537 15,970 17,114 Research and development tax credits 1,651 1,911 2,879 Permanent differences foreign exchange 4,164 Permanent differences other 1,828 616 3,856 Amortization of intangibles 188 1,730 1,467 Differences in statutory rates of foreign countries 231 45 613 Foreign withholding tax 1,444 2,450 Other, net 1,279 1,758 1,627 10,478 11,354 9,438 The permanent difference on foreign exchange is net of valuation allowance charge of 3,394,000 in 2006.
Permanent differences comprise permanent adjustments and benefits resulting from restructuring following the acquisition of Artisan.
Other, net comprises prior year adjustments, timing differences and deferred tax adjustments.

All deferred tax assets of 25,202,000 2005: 26,213,000 are expected to accrue after more than one year.
UK income taxes have not been provided at 31 December 2006 on unremitted earnings of approximately 31,809,000 2005: 14,958,000: 2004: 5,670,000 of subsidiaries located outside the UK as such earnings are considered to be permanently invested.
If these earnings were to be remitted without offsetting tax credits in the UK, taxes would be approximately 10,578,000 2005: 2,379,000: 2004: 1,122,000.
The valuation allowance relates to net operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, where management believes it is more likely than not such amounts will not be realized.
None of the loss carryforwards expires before 2018.
The future use of the net operating losses carried forward in ARM Inc. may be restricted in the event of a purchase by a third party, whereby the level of losses to be utilized on an annual basis would be limited to 4% of the market value of ARM Inc. at the date of the transaction.
As at 31 December 2006 the Company had federal net operating losses of 17,520,000 and a deferred tax asset thereon of 5,957,000.
These losses begin to expire in 2019.
The Company also had state net operating losses of 2,814,000 and a deferred tax asset of 151,000 which begin to expire in 2013.
In addition to the net operating losses the Company also had unutilized federal R&D tax credits of 3,626,000 which will begin to expire in 2012 and unutilized state R&D tax credits of 2,552,000 which have no expiration date.
As a result of FAS 123R, the Companys deferred tax assets at 31 December 2006 do not include 1,909,000 of excess tax benefits from employee share option exercises that are a component of the Companys research and development and net operating loss carryovers.
Equity will be increased by 1,909,000 if and when such excess tax benefits are ultimately realized.

Significant technological changes in the industry could affect operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash, cash equivalents, shortand long-term investments and marketable securities and accounts receivable.
The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of the Companys customers are large, well-established companies.
The Company has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Company markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions.
At 31 December 2004, 2005 and 2006 no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
At 31 December 2005 and 2006, the Companys cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits and corporate bonds for varying periods up to two years.
100 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 6 Acquisitions Falanx Microsystems AS On 30 May 2006, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Falanx Microsystems AS Falanx, a graphics IP company incorporated in Norway for total consideration of $25.1 million 13.4 million, comprising $24.9 million cash consideration and $0.2 million of related acquisition expenses.
The acquisition fits the ARM strategy of enabling users to create SoCs seamlessly in their design process.
The Mali Graphics Processor Unit GPU is a combination of hardware and software that enables industry-leading 3D graphics and video on mobile phones, portable media players, set-top boxes, handheld gaming devices and automotive systems, providing the Company with full control over the development of its future 3D graphics solutions.
The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
The operating results for Falanx have been included in these financial statements for the period from 30 May 2006 to 31 December 2006.
The acquisition was accounted for under SFAS 141.
The following table sets out the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: Fair value to Company 000 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents 24 Accounts receivable, net 118 Other debtors 101 Deferred tax asset 543 Property and equipment, net 62 Total assets acquired 848 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other creditors 238 Accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 368 Total liabilities assumed 606 Net assets acquired 242 The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Falanx and those intangible assets of Falanx that could be clearly identified.
These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Falanx concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Falanx clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 242 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 3 5 4,267 Customer relationships 3 990 Deferred tax liability 1,472 Goodwill 9,383 Purchase price 13,410 If the acquisition of Falanx had occurred on 1 January 2006, net income for the Company would have been 0.8 million lower than reported, including the additional amortization of intangibles.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 101 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 6 Acquisitions continued Soisic SA On 30 October 2006, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Soisic SA Soisic, a silicon-on-insulator SOI IP company incorporated in France for consideration of 15.1 million 3.4 million, comprising 14.7 million cash consideration and 10.4 million of related acquisition expenses.
With this acquisition, the Company is making an investment in new technologies related to physical IP to enhance its leadership position in providing customers access to the higher performance and lower power offered by SOI process technologies.
Soisic develops a similar set of products to the ARM Physical IP Division, specifically standard cells, static random access memory SRAM compilers and input output I O cells, however, based on SOI design rules and process models.
Integrating this capability with ARMs widely-used physical IP opens the possibility for system-on-chip SoC designers to access SOI technology, which currently is used only in full custom designs, such as high-performance microprocessors.
The Company is investing in this area to be at the forefront of the design technologies needed to exploit the potential advantages of SOI as its usage grows in mobile, home and enterprise SoC and ASIC applications.
A further 18 million is potentially payable on the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones and will be accrued when the milestones have been achieved, other than as noted below, whereby a small portion of this contingent consideration has been accrued at acquisition.
The operating results for Soisic have been included in these financial statements for the period from 30 October 2006 to 31 December 2006.
The following table sets out the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: Fair value to Company 000 Assets: Accounts receivable, net 165 Other debtors 411 Deferred tax asset 1,392 Property and equipment, net 117 Total assets acquired 2,085 Liabilities: Cash overdraft 53 Accounts payable and other creditors 949 Accrued liabilities 413 Total liabilities assumed 1,415 Net assets acquired 670 The intangible assets recognized represented those intangible assets of Soisic that could be clearly identified.
These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Soisic concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Soisic clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 670 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 5 4,283 Deferred tax liability 1,413 Purchase price 3,540 The purchase price above includes 0.1 million of contingent consideration.
Whilst the Company does not normally accrue this payable until earned, in line with SFAS 141 it has been accrued to reduce any potential negative goodwill to nil.
If the acquisition of Soisic had occurred on 1 January 2006, net income for the Company would have been 2.5 million lower than reported, including the additional amortization of intangibles.
102 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 6 Acquisitions continued PowerEscape Inc. On 21 June 2006, the Company purchased certain assets of PowerEscape Inc. a private company incorporated in the US, for total consideration of $1.1 million 0.6 million, comprising $1.0 million cash consideration and $0.1 million of related acquisition expenses.
The PowerEscape team, which has been integrated into the Companys Development Systems Division, will focus on adding innovative profiling and analysis features to the Companys portfolio of market-leading development tools.
The Company has allocated 595,000 of the purchase price to in-process research and development which reflects certain research projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability or had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition.
In-process research and development has been written-off immediately to the income statement.
Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. On 27 October 2005, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Keil Elektronik GmbH KEG, a company incorporated in Germany for total consideration of $10.9 million 6.1 million, comprising $10.4 million cash consideration and $0.5 million of related acquisition expenses.
On the same day, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Keil Software Inc. KSI, a US company, for total consideration of $5.2 million 2.9 million, comprising $5.0 million cash consideration and $0.2 million of related acquisition expenses.
The Company has identified the MCU market as a critical growth area for the Companys future business and with this acquisition, the Company will be able to accelerate progress in that market by offering a more complete solution.
As the MCU applications shift from 8 16-bit to 32-bit solutions, the combination of the ARM Cortex-M3 processor, which is ideally suited for microcontroller applications, the RealView high-performance compiler, and Keils complementary MCU tools for ARM, will enable new generations of ARM MCU solutions.

The financial milestones relating to the first year post-acquisition were achieved in 2006 and are accrued at the year end.
Further potential payments relating to the second year post-acquisition will be accrued when payable.
Keil is a leading independent provider of software development tools for the microcontoller MCU market.
The operating results for Keil have been included in these financial statements for the period 27 October 2005 to 31 December 2005 in the 2005 comparatives and for the entire year in 2006.
The following table sets out the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as reported in the 2005 annual report: KEG KSI Fair value to Company 000 000 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents 2,911 32 Accounts receivable, net 477 169 Inventories 60 36 Other debtors 11 5 Property and equipment, net 12 Total assets acquired 3,471 242 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other creditors 1,593 19 Accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 2,280 62 Total liabilities assumed 3,873 81 Net liabilities assumed assets acquired 402 161 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 103 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 6 Acquisitions continued The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Keil and those intangible assets of Keil that could be clearly identified.
These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Keil concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Keil clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: KEG KSI Useful estimated life years 000 000 Fair value of net liabilities assumed assets acquired 402 161 Intangible assets acquired: Customer relationships 2 3 4,290 482 Developed technology 1 5 2,744 Trade names 5 1,175 Deferred tax liability 2,673 663 Goodwill 2,178 1,764 Purchase price 6,137 2,919 KEG made a profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 1.0 million and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a profit after tax of 1.0 million.
The results of the Company would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KEG and KSI occurred on the 1 January 2005.
During 2006, a further $1.1 million and $0.4 million consideration became payable for KEG and KSI respectively following the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones, with a corresponding increase to total consideration and goodwill.
In addition, the provisional fair values in respect of KEGs income tax liabilities were finalized resulting in an increase in the net assets acquired by 1.1 million.
Due to this change in fair value, an additional 1.1 million of consideration was paid.
As both consideration and net assets were increased by the same amount, there was no corresponding change to goodwill.
Axys Design Automation Inc. On 16 August 2004, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc. a US company, for total consideration of $12.5 million 6.9 million, comprising $11.6 million cash consideration and $0.9 million of related acquisition expenses.

There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Axys clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The allocation of the purchase price, as at 31 December 2004, to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 465 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 5 1,379 Customer relationships 5 425 Trademarks 5 96 In-process research and development 383 Deferred tax liability 760 Goodwill 4,914 Purchase price 6,902 Axys profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2003 was 0.02 million and for the period from 1 January 2004 until acquisition was a loss of 0.9 million.
As noted above, a further $3 million consideration was paid during 2005 following the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones.
As a result, total consideration and resultant goodwill increased by 1,690,000 during that year.
Artisan Components Inc. On 23 December 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Artisan Components Inc. a leading provider of physical IP components for the design and manufacture of complex system-on-chip SoC integrated circuits.
The acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industrys broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base, with highly complementary sales channels combining ARMs channel to more than 170 silicon manufacturers with Artisans channel to more than 2,000 companies.
It better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases, and strengthens the links between the key aspects of SoC development, enabling the combined company to deliver solutions that are further optimized for power and performance.
The operating results for Artisan have been included in these financial statements for the period 23 December 2004 to 31 December 2004 in the 2004 comparatives and for the entire year in 2005 and 2006.
The total consideration paid was $926.9 million 481.7 million, comprising cash of $235.4 million 122.3 million, 324,399,411 ordinary shares in the Company with a fair value of $524.2 million 272.4 million, approximately 90.4 million share options issued to existing Artisan employees with fair value of $151.9 million 79.0 million and related direct acquisition fees of $15.4 million 8.0 million including legal, valuation and accounting fees.
These provisional fair values were subsequently amended during 2005 as noted below.
The shares issued in the acquisition were valued in accordance with Emerging Issues Take Force Issue No.
99-12 EITF 99-12, Determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination.
In accordance with EITF 99-12, the Company established the first date on which the number of the Company shares and the amount of other consideration became fixed as of 23 August 2004.
Accordingly the Company valued the transaction using the average closing price of the Companys ordinary shares two days before and after 23 August 2004, or $1.616 per share.
The assumed options to acquire ordinary shares were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model with volatility of between 80% and 94%, an average risk-free interest rate of 4.5%, an estimated life of between zero and six years, and dividend yield of 0.7%.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 105 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 6 Acquisitions continued The following table sets out the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as reported in the 2004 annual report: Fair value to Company 000 Assets: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 82,567 Accounts receivable, net 15,078 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,225 Deferred tax asset 15,446 Property and equipment, net 2,509 Total assets acquired 118,825 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other creditors 3,674 Accrued and other liabilities 13,245 Deferred revenue 6,545 Total liabilities assumed 23,464 Net assets acquired 95,361 The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Artisan and those intangible assets of Artisan that could be clearly identified.
These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Artisan concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income-generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Artisan clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The provisional allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 95,361 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 4 5 18,177 Patents core technology 5 7 11,719 Existing agreements and customer relationships 3 8 36,354 Trademarks tradenames 4 5 2,500 Order backlog 0 1 1,354 In-process research and development 3,229 Deferred stock-based compensation 9,579 Deferred tax liability 28,042 Goodwill 331,432 Purchase price 481,663 Developed technology Developed technology of 18.2 million and patents and core technology of 11.7 million included intellectual property components for use in SoC integrated circuits and consisted of the following: embedded memory, standard cell, input output components, and analog and mixed-signal products.
In addition, developed technology included a combination of processes, patents, patent applications, core modular architecture and trade secrets that are the buildings blocks of the technology.
At the date of acquisition, the developed technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the developed technology and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the developed technology, an income approach was used with a discount rate of 14% for existing technology and 16% for patents and core technology, which included an analysis of future cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows.
All developed technologies are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of four to five years.
Existing agreements and customer relationships and order backlog The customer base of 36.4 million and order backlog of 1.4 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, royalty arrangements, and support and maintenance agreements.
To estimate the fair value of the customer base and order backlog, a cost approach replacement value was used.
The customer base and order backlog are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to six years for customer base and one year for order backlog.
Trademarks and tradenames The fair value assigned to trademarks and tradenames, including the company name Artisan, was estimated using the income approach, which discounts the present value of attributable cash flows at a discount rate of 16%.
In-process research and development Development projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as developed technology and the value assigned to developed technology was capitalized.
Expensed in-process research and development of 3.2 million reflected certain research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability or had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition.
The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was estimated using the income approach, which discounts to present value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility using a discount rate of 19%.
106 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 6 Acquisitions continued Goodwill of 331.4 million represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible sets acquired.
As stated, the acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industrys broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base and it better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases.
These, combined with the ability to hire the entire Artisan work force, were significant contributing factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill.
In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company is not amortizing goodwill relating to the acquisition.
It is being carried at cost and the Company tests it for impairment annually and whenever events indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
The pro forma results of the Company for 2004, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2004, and for the prior year, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2003, would have been: 2003 2004 Unaudited Unaudited 000 000 Revenues 173,277 197,852 Income from operations 3,730 15,973 Net income 1,650 16,365 Diluted earnings per ordinary share 0.1p 1.2p Net income has been reduced in these pro forma results in relation to reduced interest income as a result of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration, amortization of intangibles acquired and amortization of deferred compensation.
During 2005, the provisional fair values were finalized resulting in an increase in the net assets acquired of $2.9 million 1.5 million with a corresponding decrease to goodwill.
The principal adjustments were an increase to the deferred tax asset representing deductions arising on exercise of options issued in a business combination, in accordance with EITF00-23 of 4.8 million, an increase in intangible assets acquired including in-process research and development but net of deferred tax of 0.8 million, a reduction in deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses of 1.4 million, and additional provisions for unaccrued costs of 2.7 million.

Licenses to use technology are being amortized over periods of three to five years.
The amortization periods for licenses have been determined according to their estimated useful economic life.
Patents are being amortized over four to five years, developed and core technology the main IP of the Company existent at acquisition and generating revenue over five years and customer relationships relationships with customers which were generating revenue at acquisition over two to six years, being the periods over which the Company is expected to derive benefit from them.
The estimated amortization expense of intangible assets in each of the next five years is set forth below: 000 2007 18,879 2008 17,469 2009 10,989 2010 7,645 2011 1,045 108 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 9 Intangible assets continued Until the adoption of SFAS 142 on 1 January 2002 see footnote 1, goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to three years, determined in each case by reference to employee turnover rates in the industry and the individual technology acquired with the acquisitions.
In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, and is tested for impairment at least annually.
The split of goodwill by segment is shown below.
Additions in the year relating to Keil and Falanx have been allocated to the Development Systems and Processor divisions respectively.
The foreign exchange difference arises as goodwill on Artisan, Axys and KSI is denominated in US dollars and thus is subject to revaluation at the period-end rates.
Changes in the carrying amount for the year are as follows: Development Systems Processor Division Physical IP Division Division Total 000 000 000 000 Balance at 1 January 2006 113,358 259,197 13,017 385,572 Additions KEG 635 635 Additions KSI 209 209 Additions Falanx 9,383 9,383 Exchange differences 13,645 31,836 1,075 46,556 Balance at 31 December 2006 109,096 227,361 12,786 349,243 10 Accounts receivable Included within accounts receivable at 31 December 2006 are 23.8 million 2005: 20.5 million of amounts recoverable on contracts.
11 Accrued liabilities Included within accrued liabilities at 31 December 2006 are 8.8 million 2005: 0.7 million for staff costs and 3.2 million 2005: 1.8 million representing unpaid consideration for acquisitions.
12 Shareholders equity Share options The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any five-year period.
Options issued prior to the listing of the Company are excluded from this calculation.
The exercise of options or vesting of share awards will be satisfied either out of newly-issued share capital, or from shares held by the Company as treasury stock or within the ESOP.
Treasury stock is purchased from the market and the quantum and timing of these purchases is at the discretion of the directors, and based on the share price and short-term cash requirements of the Company.
From 2006, the Company has begun issuing Restricted Stock Units RSUs to employees instead of options as approved at the 2006 AGM.
The main RSU awards to employees in all jurisdictions other than France vest similarly to the unapproved scheme above, namely 25% on the each anniversary over four years.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 109 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 12 Shareholders equity continued Additionally from 2006, the Company has started the new Deferred Annual Bonus plan DAB.
Under the DAB, which is for directors and selected senior management within the Company, participants are required to defer 50% of any related annual bonus into shares on a compulsory basis.
These shares will be deferred for three years, and then a further matching award will be made depending on the achievement of an EPS performance condition over that time.
The Company also operates the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, also for directors and selected senior management, whereby share awards are made and vest depending on the Companys TSR performance compared to two comparator groups over the three-year performance period.
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods.
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM Inc. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed.
The Company set up further savings-related option schemes in each year up to and including 2006 for all employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up in 1998.
The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2006 was 0.43 2005: 0.38: 2004: 0.74.
Included within these are options within the SAYE scheme which have an exercise price that was 85% of the market price at date of grant.
The weighted average grant-date fair value of these SAYE options granted during 2006 was 0.44 2005: 0.40: 2004: 0.73.
The weighted-average exercise price of these SAYE options granted during 2006 was 1.0264 2005: 0.9095: 2004: 0.9435.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised and LTIP awards made in 2006 was 21.6 million and 5.2 million respectively.
This intrinsic value represents the difference between the fair market value of the Companys shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option.
The total fair value of LTIP awards that vested in 2006 was 1.7 million.
Based on the closing price of the Companys shares on 31 December 2006 of 1.2575 per share, the total pre-tax intrinsic value of all outstanding options, RSUs and LTIP awards was 67.3 million.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of all exerciseable options at 31 December 2006 was 39.2 million.
The total cash received on the exercise of options in the year was 17.9 million.
The total tax benefits realized from the exercise of options and share awards in the year was 9.0 million.
RSUs and LTIP awards have no exercise price and all were unvested at 31 December 2006.
13 Commitments and contingencies The Company leases its office facilities which expire at various dates through 2018 and certain equipment including EDA design tools which expire at various dates through 2009 under non-cancelable operating lease agreements.
Future minimum lease commitments at 31 December 2006, are as follows: Operating leases Years ending 31 December 000 2007 16,773 2008 15,619 2009 6,526 2010 2,445 2011 2,183 Thereafter 9,122 Total minimum lease payments 52,668 Rental expense under operating leases totaled 12,627,000, 15,809,000 and 18,800,000 for the years ended 31 December 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
In May 2002, Nazomi Communications, Inc. Nazomi filed suit against ARM alleging willful infringement of Nazomis US Patent No.
On 30 January 2007 the District Court granted ARMs motion for summary judgment.
Furthermore, on 13 February 2007 Nazomi filed notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Based on legal advice and written opinions received from external counsel, ARM is confident that the accused ARM technology does not infringe any of the claims of the 584 Patent or that the patent is invalid.
ARM has voluntarily joined as a party to the Litigation to proactively defend its technology against ill conceived and false infringement allegations and fully expects to prove the case for non-infringement or invalidity in the course of the Litigation.
ARM does not expect any significant liability in respect of these claims.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 111 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 13 Commitments and contingencies continued Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party.
Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee infringes such third partys intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the license and will continue in perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
There was no provision for such guarantees at either 31 December 2006 or 31 December 2005.
At 31 December 2006, ARM had provided in aggregate 1.1 million 2005: 0.8 million in relation to claims, being the expected future costs to be incurred.
At 31 December 2006, the Company had outstanding capital commitments of 525,000 2005: 1,371,000.
14 Geographic and segment information At 31 December 2006, the Company is organized on a worldwide basis into three business segments, namely the Processor Division PD, the Physical IP Division PIPD and the Development Systems Division DevSys.
In 2004, the directors were of the opinion the Company only had one class of business, and then following the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004, the Company had two reportable segments in 2005 namely PD and PIPD.
This was based upon the Companys internal organization and management structure and was the primary way in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and the rest of the board were provided with financial information.
Whilst revenues were reported into four main revenue streams namely licensing, royalties, development systems and services, the costs, operating results and balance sheets were only analyzed into the two segments.
In 2006, this structure and system of internal financial reporting to the CODM and board was changed resulting in a third division, namely DevSys, becoming a separate reportable segment.
In previous years, the results of DevSys were reported within PD, but for ease of comparability, have been separated out in the comparatives below.
Unallocated assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities, some deferred tax balances, current tax and VAT.
There are no inter-segment revenues.

15 Fair values of financial instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Marketable securities The carrying amount approximates fair value because these instruments are marked-to-market.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency contracts and embedded derivatives are estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows: At 31 December 2005 2006 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 128,077 128,077 90,743 90,743 Short-term investments 23,990 23,990 18,600 18,600 Marketable securities 8,835 8,835 19,151 19,151 Accounts receivable 55,518 55,518 69,552 69,552 Foreign currency contracts 1,708 1,708 439 439 Embedded derivatives 722 722 1,620 1,620 16 Valuation and qualifying accounts Charged Acquired with Balance at credited to subsidiary Foreign Balance at 1 January income statement undertaking Reclassification exchange 31 December 000 000 000 000 000 000 2006 allowance for doubtful debts 2,173 932 377 172 2,556 2005 allowance for doubtful debts 1,451 547 27 148 2,173 2004 allowance for doubtful debts 1,115 321 657 1,451 2006 valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 366 3,394 2,289 6,049 2005 valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 254 112 366 2004 valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 503 249 254 17 Post balance sheet events At the 2007 Annual General Meeting of the Company, a final dividend of 0.6 pence per share total cost 8,002,000 will be proposed in respect of the 2006 financial year, and if approved will be paid on 21 May 2007 to shareholders on the register at 4 May 2007.

A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been consistently applied and reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18, Accounting policies, is set out below: Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at cost.
Where an acquisition satisfied the provisions of sections 131 to 134 of the Companies Act 1985 for merger relief, the investment is stated at the nominal value of shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration.
Cash flow statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Revised 1996 Cash flow statements which provides that where a company is a member of a group and a consolidated cash flow statement is published, the company does not have to prepare a cash flow statement.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences have been included in operating profit.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments The Company does not have any financial instruments, other than intercompany payables and receivables and cash.
Due to the short-term nature of these balances, the Company considers the fair value of these items to equal the carrying value.
Share schemes The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are separately administered trusts which are funded by loans the ESOP and loans and gifts the QUEST from the Group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts and shares held by the trusts are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments, including an LTIP, to certain employees of subsidiary undertakings.
In accordance with FRS 20, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed in the accounts of the subsidiary companies on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
The Companys subsidiaries have recognised a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans and US ESPPs.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of FRS 20 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The Company does not have any employees and as such all share-based compensation has been recorded as capital contributions to subsidiaries.
Treasury shares The Company has a share buyback programme under which the Company purchases its own shares and holds them as treasury shares.
These shares will be used to satisfy employee share option exercises and other share awards.
In accordance with UITF 38, the Company recognises these shares at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
2 Profit for the financial year As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The parent companys profit after taxation, including dividends receivable and before dividends payable was 6,741,000 2005: 19,908,000.
