Stated after reducing the 2002 invested capital by 87.0m to reflect the sale of the Ski and Munch Bunch brands and associated assets on 2 April 2002.
For 2005 06 and 2004 05 the dividend is the interim paid and the final proposed dividend in respect of the financial year then ended.
The years ended 2002 to 2004 have been restated to comply with UITF Abstract 38.
The year ended 2001 has been restated to comply with FRS 19 Deferred tax.
The amounts disclosed for 2004 and earlier periods are stated on the basis of UK GAAP because it is not practicable to restate amounts for periods prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS are explained in note 36 of the financial statements which provides an explanation of the transition to IFRS.
