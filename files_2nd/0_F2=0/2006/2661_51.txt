Clean EBITDA and Clean earnings per share are performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the business and remove the impact of one-off and non-cash items.
They are therefore calculated before reorganisation costs, IPO-related expenses, non-recurring costs associated with the settlement of legal claims by certain skins as well as non-cash charges relating to share-based payments which are to be satisfied by existing shares that were effectively gifted to the Employee Trust by the Principal Shareholders and share-based payments to employees made by The Bonita Trust see note 26.
