Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 | 88 39 Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued The areas in which IFRS has the most significant impact are: a Employee benets pensions IAS 19 Employee Benets mainly affects accounting for dened benefit pension schemes by requiring full recognition of dened benefit pension surpluses or deficits on the balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP Emap had been accounting for pensions under the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, which allows pension deficits to be spread over the remaining service life of the employees.
Emap has chosen to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in respect of dened benefit pension schemes at the date of transition to IFRS.
It has also chosen to adopt early the amendment to IAS 19 and to recognise actuarial gains and losses arising from the latest actuarial valuation in full through the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
On transition, the balance sheet reflects an IAS 19 net pension deficit of 27m, compared to a SSAP 24 prepayment of 5m under UK GAAP.
The result is a 32m reduction in net assets on transition, excluding the impact of deferred tax.
In 2005, the impact of IFRS is to reduce the pension charge as previously reported under UK GAAP by 2m.
The balance sheet at 31 March 2005 reects an IAS 19 pension deficit of 22m compared to a 6m prepayment under UK GAAP.
The effect on net assets is therefore a reduction of 28m, excluding the impact of deferred tax.
An actuarial gain of 1m has been recognised in equity.
b Employee benets share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based payment requires a charge in the income statement for share-based payments to employees based on the fair value of share options and awards granted.
The fair value of the equity instrument is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is calculated according to share option pricing models, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
An IFRS 2 charge is required for all grants of shares and share options including SAYE options.
Given that such options were exempt under UK GAAP, Emap has had to reect a charge for its SAYE options for the first time.
A charge is also reected for the market value of ESOP share options.
No charge was recognised for these under UK GAAP as the charge was based on the intrinsic market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant.
As permitted under IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS, Emap has applied IFRS 2 only to share options and awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
No charge has been reected in the financial statements for grants of shares prior to 7 November 2002.
The charge under IFRS is 1m lower in 2005 than under UK GAAP, however the IFRS charge is expected to rise as the cumulative number of schemes in operation increases in the valuation period.
There is no impact on the net assets of the Group as the charge to the income statement is matched by an equal credit through reserves.
c Business combinations and intangible assets Emap has taken advantage of the exemption from applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations to acquisitions occurring before 1 April 2004.
There is therefore no difference between the goodwill shown in the transition balance sheet and that shown under UK GAAP.
Business combinations occurring after 1 April 2004 have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3.
This affects the 2004 acquisitions of ABI Building Data Limited ABI and Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival Cannes Lions.
Under UK GAAP, all intangible assets relating to acquisitions were allocated to goodwill.
Under IFRS, however, intangible assets which meet the denition under IAS 38 Intangible Assets have been recognised separately from goodwill.
These assets are then amortised over their useful lives.
The result for ABI has been an allocation of approximately 8m to customer lists with a useful life of three years.
For Cannes Lions, the result has been to identify 45m as brand value with an indefinite useful life.
Under IFRS 3, the amortisation of goodwill ceases and goodwill is instead subject to an annual impairment review.
The 2005 goodwill amortisation charge of 18m under UK GAAP is therefore reversed under IFRS, with a corresponding increase to goodwill on the balance sheet.
4m of amortisation relating to associates and joint ventures is also reversed.
The overall amortisation credit of 22m has been offset by a charge of 2m arising from the amortisation of ABI customer lists over a useful life of three years.
No additional amortisation has been recognised under IFRS for the 45m of brand value attributed to the Cannes Lions acquisition since it has an indefinite useful life.
d Assets held for sale During 2005, Emap agreed to sell its holding in ABI following the findings of the Competition Commission.
Although the sale was announced on 10 May 2005, ABI had qualied at 31 March 2005 as an investment available for sale of 12m on the balance sheet in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Increasing the amortisation by 2m for ABI intangibles has the corresponding effect of reducing the loss on sale by 2m.
Emap has concluded that the results of ABI up to the date of disposal of ABI were not material.
In addition, ABI is not considered a major line of business.
Had these conclusions been different, all revenues, costs and losses would, in this instance, have been separately presented in the Consolidated income statement as a single line item below profit after tax.
This would have had the presentational effect of increasing profit before tax by the amount of the loss.
Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 | 89 Consolidated accounts Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2006 continued 39 Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued e Deferred taxation IAS 12 Income Taxes requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences, rather than on timing differences as under UK GAAP.
On transition, the net deferred tax liability increases by 107m.
The total impact on the 2005 tax charge is a 19m credit while the net deferred tax liability on the balance sheet increases by 102m at 31 March 2005.
The key impacts on deferred tax are in the following areas.
Intangible assets valuation of titles Under IFRS, a deferred tax balance is recognised in a business combination for any difference between the fair value of an acquired asset and its equivalent tax basis.
Emap has acquired a number of titles and consequently recognised them as intangibles these amount to approximately 364m on transition.
Because some of these acquisitions were structured as a purchase of shares, the value of title that was recognised for accounting purposes has no equivalent tax basis.
The Group has therefore recognised a deferred tax liability of 120m on transition.
The recognition of such a deferred tax liability in a business combination would normally result in a corresponding increase in goodwill.
However, as Emap has taken the exemption from restating business combinations i. e. acquisitions occurring before the date of transition on 1 April 2004, the Group is not permitted to adjust the carrying value of goodwill prior to the transition date.
Consequently, the recognition of the liability has meant an equivalent reduction in reserves.
At 31 March 2005, a net deferred tax liability of 102m remains on the balance sheet following a credit of 19m through the income statement in the period.
Pension schemes A deferred tax asset of 8m has been recognised on transition, arising from the recognition of the pension scheme deficits.
The deferred tax asset was 7m at 31 March 2005.
Share schemes A deferred tax asset of 2m, as at 31 March 2005, has been calculated on the basis of all share option payments that will be deductible for current tax in the future.
This includes option payments arising before 7 November 2002.
To the extent that option payments are not reected in the income statement, tax relief arising has not been reected in the income statement but has been reected through equity.
Other The deferred tax impact of the other IFRS adjustments has been included.
As a result, the net deferred tax liability has fallen by 3m at transition and 2m at 31 March 2005. f Financial instruments Emap took the exemption available in IFRS 1 from applying IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to its 2005 results.
The effect of the adoption of this standard from 1 April 2005 is addressed in Note 40. g Recognition of dividends Under IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are recognised in the period in which they are authorised.
Consequently, the final dividend relating to a particular financial year cannot be accounted for until the following financial year when it is approved by shareholders.
In addition, dividends are no longer shown on the face of the income statement but instead are recognised as a movement in equity.
The effect on the balance sheet is to reduce liabilities by 40m on transition, and by 44m at 31 March 2005. h Functional currencies Under IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, it is a requirement to determine the functional currency of each entity included in the Group consolidation.
It has been concluded that several holding companies in the Group structure are acting with no significant degree of autonomy and are carrying out their activities as an extension of the entity Emap plc.
As a result, these holding companies are treated for consolidation purposes as having a Pound Sterling functional currency rather than a Euro functional currency as previously reported under UK GAAP.
The effect of this in 2005 is to transfer 1m of foreign exchange losses from equity to the income statement in relation to foreign exchange differences on short-term inter-company loans.
i Holiday pay Under IAS 19 employers are required to recognise an accrual for holiday pay.
This represents holiday that the Groups employees are entitled to at the balance sheet date, but have not yet taken.
j Other Other includes adjustments such as lease premiums under SIC 15 Operating Leases Incentives, where rent incentives are spread over the period of the lease rather than to the first break clause as under UK GAAP.
It also includes adjustments to associates and joint ventures, and related provisions.
