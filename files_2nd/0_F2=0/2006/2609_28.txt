The impairment charge of 0.4m 2005: 3.2m has been included in net operating expenses in the income statement.
The impairment charge was based on a review of the value of the assets in use and on pre-tax cash flows attributable to these assets in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The pre-tax discount rate used in these calculations was 10%.
Based on a valuation report prepared by Colliers Conrad Ritblat Erdman, dated 16 May 2006, the existing use value of Burberry Groups ten most significant freehold properties is 158m.
This valuation is 96m higher than the net book value of these assets.
The directors do not intend to incorporate this valuation into the accounts but set out the valuation for information purposes only.
