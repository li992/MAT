Notes relating to the Group accounts continued 30 Acquisitions and disposals continued Disposals On 1 September 2006, ICI completed the sale of its oleochemicals and surfactants business, Uniqema, to Croda International Plc for a gross consideration of 410m, subject to closing balance sheet adjustments.
The disposal was effected in view of other investment opportunities available across the Group, where there is the prospect of greater strategic and financial returns.
On 7 February 2005, the Group completed the sale of the Vinamul Polymers business part of National Starch for 114m, satisfied in cash, and the control of the business passed to the acquirer.
The net disposal proceeds were used to reduce Group debt.
On 30 April 2004, the Group completed the sale of the Quest Food Ingredients business for 253m, satisfied in cash, on which date the control of the business passed to the acquirer.
The disposal was effected in order for Quest to focus on its flavour and fragrance businesses.
The reconciliations of the profit on sale of Uniqema, Vinamul Polymers and of Quest Food Ingredients disclosed on page 72, with the cash proceeds and net assets disposed of are set out in the tables below.

112 ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2006 www.
com Accounts 31 Financial instruments continued Hedging Interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Sterling, have been executed to hedge the Groups exposure to interest rate risks in accordance with its interest rate policy.
These swaps are matched in maturity to the underlying debt.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 1,957m 2005 2,330m.
The maturity profile of the net fixed rate exposure on loans is spread over several years to reduce re-financing and re-pricing risk and matures between 2007 and 2013.
The fair value of interest rate swaps recognised as hedges at 31 December 2006 is a net liability of 13m 2005 4m, comprised of assets of 7m 2005 17m and liabilities of 20m 2005 21m.
From 1 January 2005 interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges are fair valued through the income statement as part of net finance expense.
Underlying loans that form part of fair value hedge relationships are adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk through the income statement to offset any mark-to-market adjustment arising on the interest rate swaps.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all fair value hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
All designated hedges have remained effective throughout the current financial year.

Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest based upon short-term inter-bank rates.
Interest rate swaps have been used to create floating debt during the current financial year in line with Group policy.
The impact on loans, post interest rate swaps, is that interest rates will be refixed at intervals of between 3 months and 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis provided in the financial review section of the Business review on page 30 indicates the Groups risks in relation to interest rate changes.
The figures shown above take into account various interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to manage the interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities.

The fair value of the underlying loans and related derivative liabilities are also presented in the financial liabilities table above and to understand the fair value of financial liabilities it is appropriate to also include derivative assets.
114 ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2006 www.
com Accounts 31 Financial instruments continued b Income statement and equity In 1999 the Group entered a US$1bn interest rate swap that was used to manage its interest rate exposure.
When the underlying item was removed from the Groups balance sheet as a result of a divestment transaction, the swap was no longer performing as a hedge.
To manage this exposure, the Group elected to trade a new equal and opposite swap that effectively closed out its exposure to the original US$1bn swap.
By trading this equal and opposite swap, the Group was in substance terminating the US$1bn swap.
This transaction did, however, lock in a negative carrying value i. e. a fixed interest expense until the maturity of both swaps in 2007.
At 1 January 2005, as a result of the transition to IAS 39, these two swaps were fair valued through the hedging reserve.
They are fair valued through the income statement from this date onwards, giving rise to very minimal interest rate risk for the Group.
This has resulted in a gain of 2m during the year 2005 1m.
Interest is paid and received in US dollars each quarter.
The interest rate component of cross currency swaps is recognised in the income statement as it is not part of an effective hedge relationship.
Only the foreign exchange component see section d of this note is utilised to hedge net investments in accordance with Group policy.
The fair value movement on the interest rate component in 2006 was nil 2005 nil.
Cross currency swaps have a nominal value at the balance sheet date of 248m.
c Liquidity risk The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, as defined in section a of this note, at 31 December 2006 was as follows: 2006 2005 m m In one year or less 1,781 1,719 In more than one year but not more than two years 301 480 In more than two years but not more than three years 1 300 In more than three years but not more than four years 21 1 In more than four years but not more than five years 2 24 In more than five years 255 304 2,361 2,828 d Foreign currency risk The Group mainly is exposed to foreign currency risk arising on sales, purchases and borrowings outside of Group functional currencies.
All derivatives managing currency exposures are stated in the balance sheet at fair value.
The financial review section of the Business review on pages 30 and 31 indicates the Groups sensitivity to currency risks.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group does not hedge exposures arising from sales and purchases except where they are significant and markets exist to hedge working capital exposure in line with Group policy.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
All of the forward contracts have maturities of less than one year at the balance sheet date.
Hedge accounting is not applied for derivatives used to manage these currency exposures.
Both the changes in fair value of the forward contracts and the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the underlying monetary items are recognised as part of operating profit.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used to manage transaction exposure is nil at 31 December 2006 2005 nil.
Cash flow hedging The Group also hedges foreign exchange exposures arising from significant firm commitments and forecast transactions.
After 1 January 2005, these transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the defined accounting policy and hedge documentation is prepared for all cash flow hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
Gains and losses on cash flow hedges that have been deferred in the cash flow hedging reserve during the period, in addition to those that have been recycled through the income statement, are shown in the table below.
Cash flow hedging reserve movements m Brought forward cash flow hedging reserve at 1 January 2005 1 Amounts deferred in the period on effective cash flow hedges 2 Amounts removed from the reserve and recognised in the income statement Amounts removed from the reserve and capitalised in the balance sheet Carried forward cash flow hedging reserve at 31 December 2005 1 Brought forward cash flow hedging reserve at 1 January 2006 1 Amounts deferred in the period on effective cash flow hedges 3 Amounts removed from the reserve and recognised in the income statement Amounts removed from the reserve and capitalised in the balance sheet 2 Carried forward cash flow hedging reserve at 31 December 2006 2 The above table also includes effective commodity price hedges where gains and losses have been deferred to future periods see section e of this note.
The cash flows relating to firm commitments and forecast transactions are all expected to occur in the next 24 months.
com ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2006 115 Accounts Notes relating to the Group accounts continued 31 Financial instruments continued d Foreign currency risk continued Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Group hedges its net investment in foreign entities by denominating external debt in a mix of foreign currencies and through the use of cross currency swaps and liquidity forwards.
Section a of this note shows the currency mix of debt at 31 December 2006 after taking into account the impact of derivatives.
The Group applies hedge accounting, in accordance with the defined accounting policy, for all net investment hedges.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all net investment hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
The Group recognises gains and losses on debt, cross currency swaps and liquidity forwards in equity, up to the level of net assets in accordance with Group Policy.
For all or part of the year the borrowings have exceeded the net assets on a currency-by-currency basis.
For the portion that has exceeded the net assets, the gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
This has resulted in a gain of 15m 2005 2m for the year which has been disclosed on the face of the income statement within special items.
e Commodity price risk The Group uses corn futures and call options in the USA to hedge its price exposure to this commodity.
These futures and call options are accounted for as hedges in accordance with the defined accounting policy from 1 January 2005.
Hedge documentation is maintained for all hedge relationships and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
In 2006, the Group sold put options on corn in the USA to reduce the costs of its corn hedging programme.
These put options were fair valued through the Groups income statement.
At 31 December 2006, the fair value of the call options was nil and the fair value of the put options was a gain of 1m.
The fair value of unrealised futures and call options is recognised on the balance sheet included in trade and other receivables in the table below.
Once realised, all gains and losses on futures and call options are capitalised into the carrying value of the raw materials.
The hedges have been fully effective during the period and at 31 December 2006 a gain of 3m has been deferred in the cash flow hedging reserve.
The movements in the cash flow hedging reserve are included in the table in section d of this note.
f Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: 2006 2005 Notional Notional principal Carrying Fair principal Carrying Fair amounts values values amounts values values At 31 Dec At 31 Dec At 31 Dec At 31 Dec At 31 Dec At 31 Dec m m m m m m Other investments 28 28 28 40 40 40 Cash and cash equivalents 483 483 483 394 394 394 Trade and other receivables 851 851 851 957 957 957 Current asset investments 47 47 47 28 28 28 Short-term borrowings 16 16 16 14 14 14 Loans 995 981 1,001 1,245 1,238 1,280 Trade and other payables 732 732 732 807 807 807 Other creditors and accruals 657 657 657 708 708 708 Financial liabilities 14 14 14 53 53 53 Currency swaps 52 51 51 2 1 1 # Interest rate swaps 1,957 16 16 2,330 10 10 Liquidity forwards 44 33 Total net liabilities 952 972 1,409 1,451 Financial assets 1,409 1,419 Financial liabilities 2,361 2,828 952 1,409 liability The fair value approximates to the carrying value.
For working capital balances this is due to their short-term nature.
Liquidity forwards are foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge debt and are therefore included in the financial liabilities total.
# The carrying value of interest rate swaps 16m represents the value excluding the interest payable or receivable on the swaps, which is included in trade and other payables and trade and other receivables, respectively.
The decrease in the fair value of loans for the year ended 31 December 2006 arose principally on the net repayment of loans 130m and favourable movements on foreign exchange 106m.
Where interest rate and currency instruments are designated to a group of borrowings or cash and cash equivalents with similar characteristics, altering their interest rate or currency profile, the net cash amounts to be received or paid on the agreements are accrued in current assets or liabilities and recognised as an adjustment to interest income or expense accrual accounting.
Loans that are part of fair value hedge relationships see section a of this note are held in the balance sheet at fair value and at 31 December 2006 amounted to 923m 2005 1,170m.
All other loans are held at amortised cost and the carrying value in the balance sheet is 58m at 31 December 2006 2005 68m.
116 ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2006 www.
com Accounts 31 Financial instruments continued g Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used, applied consistently, in estimating the fair value of financial instruments reflected in the tables in section f. Derivatives The fair value of all derivatives are estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve in the relevant currencies.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of all the loans is estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve in the relevant currencies.
A credit spread is added to yield curves to obtain an accurate basis for fair valuation.
Trade and other receivables payables For all receivables and payables, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Securities Where available fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
h Credit risk Surplus funds are deposited with highly rated banks or invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including money market instruments, government securities and asset backed securities in line with Group Policy.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded interest rate options.
The majority of asset backed securities have some risk of early redemption, but are of a floating rate nature and hence have minimal fixed interest rate risk.
There are no investments of a fixed rate nature with maturity greater than one year and consequently the fair value of investments is considered to be materially the same as the value in the Groups balance sheet.
The central funds on deposit at the balance sheet date were 41m 2005 76m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, which is reviewed annually, and reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2006 the aggregate value of all financial instruments with a positive fair value assets was 51m for currency swaps 2005 16m, 7m for interest rate swaps 2005 17m and 8m for forward contracts 2005 6m.
i Collateral The Group has used financial assets as collateral for the following securitisations programmes: Trade debtors includes 177m 2005 196m of receivables eligible for securitisation with a financial institution.
However, at 31 December 2006, the amount borrowed and included within short-term borrowings as liabilities was nil 2005 nil.
The Company has also provided an asset-backed guarantee, via a wholly owned subsidiary, ICI Receivables Funding Ltd the SPV specifically incorporated to provide the guarantee, for 250m to support the Companys commitments for the ICI Pension Fund see note 34.
The assetbacked guarantee is secured by way of fixed and floating charges over certain trade debtors and cash of Group companies, which have been assigned to the SPV.
At 31 December 2006, 228m 2005 268m of trade debtors included above were assigned to the SPV and 57m 2005 5m of cash and cash equivalents.
j Borrowing facilities Committed undrawn facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2006 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Expiring in one year or less 224 Expiring in more than one year and less than two years Expiring in more than two years 357 406 357 630 www.
