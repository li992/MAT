b Pension plans i Defined benefit plans 1.
Summary The Group business operations operate a number of pension schemes.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the H regulations of the country in which the employees are located, although they are, in general, funded wholly by the Group and based either on a cash balance formula or on years of service and salary earned in the last year or years of employment.
The largest defined benefit scheme is the principal UK scheme, namely the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
88 per cent 2005: 90 per cent of the liabilities of the Group defined benefit schemes are accounted for within PSPS.
I The Group also operates two smaller defined benefit schemes for UK employees in respect of Scottish Amicable and M&G activities.
For all three schemes the projected unit method was used for the most recent full actuarial valuations.
There is also a small defined benefit scheme in Taiwan.
As at 31 December 2006, the shareholders share of the surplus for PSPS and the deficits of the other schemes amounted to an 8 million deficit net of related tax relief 2005: 153 million deficit.
These amounts are determined after including amounts invested by PSPS and the M&G scheme in Prudential policies as explained later in this note.
Defined benefit schemes in the UK are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuation every three years to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes having regard to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
PSPS was last actuarially valued as at 5 April 2005 and this valuation demonstrated the scheme to be 94 per cent funded, with a shortfall of actuarially determined assets to liabilities of six per cent, representing a deficit of 243 million.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 219 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued I1: Staff and pension plans continued The finalisation of the valuation as at 5 April 2005 was accompanied by changes to the basis of funding for the scheme.
For 2006 and future years, deficit funding amounts designed to eliminate the actuarial deficit over a 10-year period have been and are being made.
Total contributions to the Scheme for deficit funding and employers contributions for ongoing service for current employees are expected to be of the order of 70-75 million per annum over a 10-year period.
However, in the calendar year 2006, total contributions were 137 A million.
This amount reflects an increased level of current contributions for ongoing service and deficit funding backdated to 6 April 2005.
These amounts compared to total contributions in 2005 of 19 million.
Under IAS 19 the basis of valuation differs markedly from the full triennial valuation basis.
In particular, IAS 19 requires assets of the scheme to be valued at their market value at the year end, while pension liabilities are required to be discounted at a rate consistent with B the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond.
As a result, the difference between IAS 19 basis assets and liabilities can be volatile.
For those schemes such as PSPS, which hold a substantial proportion of their assets in equity investments, the volatility can be particularly significant.
The economic basis including investments of PSPS and the M&G scheme in Prudential policies as assets for 2006, a 28 million 2005: 21 million pre-tax shareholder charge to operating results based on longer-term returns arises.
In addition, outside C the operating result, but included in total profits is a pre-tax shareholder credit of 167 million 2005: 32 million for net actuarial gains.
In addition, also on the economic basis, the PAC with-profits sub-fund was charged 1 million 2005: 22 million for the aggregate of service cost and net finance income and benefited by 318 million 2005: 139 million for its share of net actuarial gains on the scheme assets and liabilities.
As shareholder profits for the PAC with-profits sub-fund reflects the surplus for distribution, these amounts are effectively absorbed by an increased charge in the income statement for the transfer to the liability for unallocated surplus.
D The actuarial gains primarily represent the difference between actual and expected investment returns for the schemes and the reduction in liabilities caused by an increase in the discount rate caused by increases in corporate bond returns.
In 2006, the PSPS asset allocation was altered away from equity investments such that at 31 December 2006 the market value of equities E for the Groups defined benefit schemes represented 31 per cent 2005: 52 per cent of the total asset value whilst the bond portfolio accounted for 43 per cent 2005: 34 per cent.
The asset allocation is shown in note 5.
Surpluses and deficits on the Groups defined benefit schemes are apportioned to the PAC life fund and shareholders funds based on estimates of employees service between them.
At 31 December 2005, the deficit on the PSPS was apportioned in the ratio 70 30 F between the life fund and shareholder-backed operations.
This ratio was determined following extensive analysis of the source of the cumulative funding for the scheme to that date.
This basis has been applied for 2006 to the asset and liability movements relating to the position at 1 January 2006, and also to the deficit funding paid in the year.
However, the IAS 19 service cost for the year and employer contributions for ongoing service of current G employees, have been apportioned in the ratio relevant to current activity.
Reflecting these two elements, at 31 December 2006, the total share of the surplus on PSPS and the deficit on the smaller Scottish Amicable scheme attributable to the PAC with-profits fund amounted to a net surplus of 66 million net of related tax relief.
The discussions with the Scheme Trustee also led to an altered expectation in 2005 as to future discretionary increases.
Previously, it had been the custom to award discretionary increases by reference to inflation levels.
From 2005 it was intended that discretionary increases H will in most circumstances not exceed 2.5 per cent.
Corporate Governance The rules of the Groups largest pension arrangement, the defined benefit section of PSPS, a final salary scheme, specify that, in exercising its investment powers, the Trustees objective is to achieve the best overall investment return consistent with the security of the assets of I the scheme.
In doing this, regard is had to the nature and duration of the schemes liabilities.
The Trustee sets the benchmark for the asset mix, following analysis of the liabilities by the Schemes Actuary and, having taken advice from the Investment Managers, then selects benchmark indices for each asset type in order to measure investment performance against a benchmark return.
The Trustee reviews strategy, the asset mix benchmark and the Investment Managers objectives every three years, to coincide with the Actuarial Valuation, or earlier if the Scheme Actuary recommends.
Interim reviews are conducted annually based on changing economic circumstances and financial market levels.
The Trustee sets the general investment policy and specifies any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the benchmark, but delegates the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the Investment Managers.
In carrying out this responsibility, the Investment Managers are required by the Pensions Act 1995 to have regard to the need for diversification and suitability of investments.
Subject to a number of restrictions contained within the relevant investment management agreements, the Investment Managers are authorised to invest in any class of investment asset.
However, the Investment Managers will not invest in any new class of investment asset without prior consultation with the Trustee.
The Trustee consults the Principal Employer, the Prudential Assurance Company, on these investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the assets of the scheme lies with the Trustee.
220 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements I1: Staff and pension plans continued The investment policies and strategies for the other two UK defined benefit schemes, the M&G Group Pension Scheme and the Scottish Amicable Staff Pension Scheme, which are both final salary schemes, follow similar principles, but have different target allocations, reflecting the particular requirements of the schemes.
Assumptions The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended 31 December were as follows: 2006 2005 % % B Discount rate 5.2 4.8 Rate of increase in salaries 5.0 4.8 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 3.0 2.8 C Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Expected returns on plan assets 5.9 6.1 The rates of 2.5 per cent shown are those for PSPS.
Assumed rates of increase of pensions in payment for inflation for all other schemes are 3.0 per cent in 2006 2005: 2.8 per cent.
D The change of assumption for discretionary increases first applied in 2005 following discussion with the PSPS trustee.
For the purpose of future discretionary awards, it is assumed that a cap of a 2.5 per cent rate of increase will apply rather than, as previously applied, the assumed long-term inflation rate.
The calculations are based on current actuarially calculated mortality estimates with a specific allowance made for future improvements in mortality, which is broadly in line with that adopted for the 92 series of mortality tables prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation E Bureau of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The tables used for PSPS at 31 December 2006 were: Male: 100 per cent PMA92 with CMIR17 improvements to the valuation date and medium cohort improvements in future: and F Female: 100 per cent PFA92 with CMIR17 improvements to the valuation date and medium cohort improvements in future.
The assumed life expectancies on retirement at age 60, based on the mortality table used was: Years Male Female G Retiring today 25.0 28.1 Retiring in 15 years time 26.1 29.1 The mean term of the current PSPS liabilities is around 20 years.
H Using external actuarial advice provided by Watson Wyatt Partners for the valuation of PSPS and by Aon Limited for the M&G scheme, and internal advice for the Scottish Amicable scheme, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2006, applying the principles prescribed by IAS 19.
Summary financial position I The Group liability in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Economic position: Surplus deficit, gross of deferred tax, based on scheme assets held, including investments in Prudential insurance policies: Attributable to the PAC with-profits fund i. e. absorbed by the liability for unallocated surplus 73 329 Attributable to shareholder-financed operations i. e. to shareholders equity 8 214 Economic surplus deficit as explained in note 5 below 65 543 Add back: investments in Prudential insurance policies offset on consolidation in the Group financial statements against insurance liabilities 287 253 Provision included in balance sheet under IAS 19 as explained in note 7 below 222 796 The following disclosures explain the economic position and IAS 19 basis of accounting after eliminating investment in Prudential insurance policies on consolidation.

Group economic financial position The economic financial position of the deferred benefit pension schemes reflects the total assets of the schemes including investments in Prudential policies.
This is to be contrasted with the IAS 19 basis assets of the PSPS and M&G schemes, as consolidated into the Group balance sheet, which exclude investments in Prudential insurance policies which on the financial statement presentation are offset against A policyholder liabilities.
i The surplus or deficits on the PSPS and Scottish Amicable schemes are partially attributable to the PAC with-profits fund: and ii The M&G pension scheme has invested 161 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 147 million in Prudential insurance policies.
B Additionally, the PSPS scheme has invested 126 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 106 million in Prudential insurance policies.
As required by IFRS, this amount of scheme asset is eliminated against the policyholder liability and hence, for the purposes of preparing the consolidated balance sheet, the IAS 19 basis net pension liability is 287 million 2005: 253 million lower than the economic basis surplus of 65 million 2005: economic basis deficit of 543 million.
C On the economic basis, after including the underlying assets represented by the investments in Prudential insurance policies as scheme assets, the assets of the schemes at 31 December were: 2006 2005 m % m % Equities 1,628 31 2,543 52 D Bonds 2,259 43 1,663 34 Properties 638 12 590 12 Cash 750 14 79 2 Total value of assets 5,275 100 4,875 100 E The present value of the liabilities of the four schemes at 31 December 2006 was 5,210 million 2005: 5,418 million.
The resulting scheme surplus or deficit arising from the excess of assets over liabilities or vice versa at 31 December 2006 comprised surplus of 73 million 2005: deficit of 329 million attributable to the PAC with-profits fund and deficit of 8 million 2005: deficit of 214 million attributable to shareholder operations.

Included within the charge for 2005 of 374 million for changes in assumptions is a credit for past service costs of 115 million for a reduction in the assumed level of discretionary increase for future pensions in payment for PSPS.

Transfer value of PSPS scheme At 31 December 2006, it is estimated that the assets of the scheme are broadly sufficient to cover the liabilities of PSPS on a buyout basis including an allowance for expenses.
The buyout basis refers to a basis that might apply in the circumstance of a transfer to another appropriate financial institution.
In making this assessment it has been assumed that a more conservative investment strategy applies A together with a more prudent allowance for future mortality improvements and no allowance for discretionary pension increases.
ii Other pension plans The Group operates various defined contribution pension schemes including schemes in Jackson, Egg and Asia.
As noted earlier, the cost of the Groups contributions to these schemes in 2006 was 27 million 2005: 23 million.
B I2: Share-based payments a Relating to Prudential plc shares The Group maintains 10 main share award and share option plans relating to Prudential plc shares, which are described below.
C In the year ended 31 December 2006, two new incentive plans were created and approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeeting.
The Group Performance Share Plan GPSP and the Business Unit Performance Plan BUPP were established and directors were authorised to implement these schemes in the UK and other countries in which Prudential operates.
D The GPSP is the new incentive plan in which all executive directors and other senior executives within the Group can participate.
This scheme was established as a replacement for the Restricted Share Plan RSP under which no further awards could be made after March 2006.
Awards are granted either in the form of a nil cost option, conditional right over shares, or such other form that shall confer to the participant an equivalent economic benefit, with a vesting period of three years.
The performance condition for the initial awards was on the basis that Total Shareholder Return TSR outperformed an index comprising of peer companies.
This approach is more robust E than a rank-based approach and ensures that maximum vesting is only achieved if the Company outperforms the average comparator performance by a significant margin.
Outperformance would be measured on a compound basis and vesting of the awards between each performance point is on a straight-line sliding scale basis.
Participants would be entitled to the value of reinvested dividends that would have accrued on the shares that vest.
F The RSP was, until March 2006, the Groups long-term incentive plan for executive directors and other senior executives designed to provide rewards linked to shareholder return.
Each year participants were granted a conditional option to receive a number of shares.
There was a deferment period of three years at the end of which the award vested to an extent that depended on the performance of the Groups shares including notional reinvested dividends and on the Groups underlying financial performance.
After vesting, the award may be exercised at zero cost at any time, subject to closed period rules, in the balance of a 10-year period.
Shares are purchased in G the open market by a trust for the benefit of qualifying employees.
Currently, the trust holds at least the maximum number of shares conditionally awarded and not yet forfeited or exercised.
The RSP replaced the Executive Share Option Scheme in 1995 and all options under this prior plan had been exercised at 31 December 2005.
No rights were granted in the RSP if the Companys TSR performance as ranked against the comparator group is below 50th percentile.
H For performance at 50th percentile, an award of 25 per cent of the maximum award is made.
The maximum grant is made only if the TSR ranking of the Company is 20th percentile or above.
Between these points, the size of the grant made is calculated on a straight-line sliding scale.
This performance measure was chosen when the RSP was introduced as it reflected a combination of market practice, an assessment of Prudentials main competitors and the focus of UK investors at that time.
In normal circumstances, directors may take up I their right to receive shares at any time during the following seven years.
The BUPP is an incentive plan created to provide a common framework under which awards would be made to the Chief Executives of Prudential UK & Europe insurance operations, Jackson and Prudential Corporation Asia, being a replacement to the existing incentive plans for these individuals.
The plan is an incentive to promote ownership and encourage accountability for sustained long-term regional performance.
Awards under this plan would be based on growth in Shareholder Capital Value on the European Embedded Value EEV basis with performance measured over three years.
Upon vesting, half of the awards would be released as shares and the other half would be released in cash.
Participants are entitled to receive the value of reinvested dividends over the performance period for those shares that vest.
The growth parameters for the awards would be relevant to each region and vesting of the awards between each performance point is on a straight-line sliding scale basis.
The Savings-Related Share Option Scheme is designed to foster share ownership among UK and certain non-UK employees.
Permanent employees are eligible for this plan if they have been employed by the Group for the previous six months.
At the outset, participants choose an option period three, five or seven years, or a combination of these periods and the amount of monthly contributions to be made from their earnings during the option period, which determines the number of options granted.
The option price is fixed at the start and is based on a discount of 20 per cent to the market price.
Participants may exercise their options within six months of the end of the option period.
If options are not exercised, participants are entitled to receive a refund of their cash contributions plus interest.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 227 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued I2: Share-based payments continued The Prudential International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme operates on a similar basis to the UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, for employees in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, India and Korea.
The International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme for Non-Employees also operates on a similar basis to the UK Savings-Related A Share Option Scheme, for agents in Hong Kong.
No options may be granted under the three savings-related schemes described above if such grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and other share option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, B to exceed 10 per cent of the Companys issued ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.
The Prudential UK Share Incentive Plan SIP is also designed to foster share ownership amongst staff in designated UK businesses.
It enables employees to buy shares on a tax efficient basis.
For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is granted, purchased in the open market.
Participants have voting rights and are entitled to dividend payments which are reinvested in the C SIP.
Partnership shares may be withdrawn from the scheme at any time while matching shares may only be withdrawn five years after their award date.
Jackson operates a performance-related share award which, subject to the prior approval of the Jackson Remuneration Committee, may grant share awards to eligible employees in the form of a contingent right to receive shares or a conditional allocation of shares.
These share awards have vesting periods of four years and are at nil cost to the employee.
The employee does not have any beneficial D ownership of the shares and, accordingly, does not have any right to dividends or voting rights attaching to the shares.
Only issued shares purchased from the open market are used for the performance share award and there is no limit on the value of shares which may be granted to a participant in any year or over the life of the plan, which is usually no longer than 10 years.
The Annual Incentive Plan is designed so that a portion of any overall award may be made in the form of a deferred share award.
E A deferred share award is awarded to board members in respect of any overall annual incentive award above 50 per cent of salary, and will represent the element of the bonus above 50 per cent of salary.
The award is restricted for three years before it can be released, subject to close periods, to the participant who must not be under a period of notice at the time and must still be in employment of Prudential.
The shares are held in the employee share trust and shares equivalent to dividends otherwise payable will accumulate up F to the release date.
The Share Participation Plan was designed to encourage share ownership amongst senior executives and to provide rewards based upon various performance factors of the Group.
Each year, participants were offered the choice of a cash award, a matching share award if cash or shares to the value of the cash award were lodged, or a combination of 50 per cent of each.
Share awards vested after five years for G executive directors of Prudential plc and three years formerly five years for all other eligible employees and were transferred to the participants at no additional cost.
Ordinary shares for share awards were purchased in the open market by a trust, which held them during the vesting period for the benefit of qualifying employees.
At 31 December 2006, all outstanding shares in this plan have been paid for by employees and are registered in the names of the participants.
No new shares have been granted in this scheme since 1999.
In addition, there are other share awards which included the 1,000 Day Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and other arrangements.
H The 1,000 Day LTIP plan is a UK insurance operations performance-based plan in which the UK Remuneration Committee could, at any time up to 5 October 2005, select employees at its absolute discretion, for participation in the plan.
The performance period was 1,000 days and, based on the final performance level being at, or above, the threshold level, the committee shall grant participants 10 per cent of the allocated award in 2005, 20 per cent in 2006 and the remaining 70 per cent in 2007.
There are no beneficial interests, or any rights to I dividends until such time as the awards are released, at nil cost, to participants.
The other arrangements relate to various awards that have been made without performance conditions to individual employees, typically in order to secure their appointment or ensure retention.

The weighted average fair values of Prudential plc options and awards granted during the period are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average fair value Weighted average fair value E RSP and Other Other GPSP options Awards RSP options Awards 4.30 2.05 6.46 2.96 1.82 4.59 F The fair value amounts relating to all options including conditional nil cost options above were determined using the Black-Scholes and the Monte Carlo option-pricing models using the following assumptions: 2006 2005 RSP and Other Other GPSP options RSP options G Dividend yield % 2.64 2.64 3.19 3.19 Expected volatility % 25.48 34.32 42.93 40.38 Risk-free interest rate % 4.68 4.70 4.65 4.41 Expected option life years 3.00 3.42 3.00 3.62 H Weighted average exercise price 5.06 3.97 Weighted average share price 6.80 6.51 5.01 5.12 Under IFRS, compensation costs for all share-based compensation plans are determined using the Black-Scholes model and the Monte Carlo model.
Share options and awards are valued using the share price at the date of grant.
The compensation costs for all awards and I options are recognised in net income over the plans respective vesting periods.
The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to value all options other than the RSP and GPSP.
For these options, the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of the TSR performance conditions.
These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and exercise prices.
The expected volatility is measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over a period up to the grant date equal to the expected life of options.
Risk-free interest rates are UK gilt rates with projections for three, five and seven year terms to match corresponding vesting periods.
Dividend yield is determined as the average yield over the year of grant and expected dividends are not incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
For the RSP, volatility and correlation of the comparator group with the Group are required.
These assumptions are based on the TSR of the comparators over a period up to the grant date equal to the performance period.
For grants in 2006, an average comparator volatility of 24 per cent and an average correlation of comparators of 19 per cent were used.
In addition, for the GPSP, volatility and correlation between Prudential and an index constructed from a simple average of the TSR growth of 10 companies is required.
For grants in 2006, an average index volatility and correlation of 14 per cent and 71 per cent respectively, were used.
230 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements I2: Share-based payments continued When options are granted or awards made to employees, an estimate is made of what percentage is more than likely to vest, be forfeited, lapse or cancelled based on historical information.
Based on these estimates, compensation expense to be accrued at that date is calculated and amortised over the vesting period.
For early exercises of options or release of awards due to redundancy, death or resignation, the compensation expense is immediately recognised and for forfeitures due to employees leaving the Group, any previously A recognised expense is reversed.
However, if an employee loses their award because of the Groups failure to meet the performance criteria, previously recognised expense is not reversed.
During the year, the Group granted share options to certain non-employee independent financial advisors.
Those options were measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions consistent with those of other share options.
These transactions were B measured using an option model because the Group does not receive a separate and measurable benefit from those non-employees in exchange for the options granted.
As such, the fair value of the options themselves is more readily determinable than the services received in return.
b Relating to Egg plc shares C In April 2006, Prudential became bound or entitled to acquire shares in Egg following the announcement of its intention in December 2005 to acquire the minority interests in Egg representing approximately 21.7 per cent of the existing issued share capital of Egg.
As a consequence of this acquisition, employees of Egg that were participants of its SAYE schemes were requested to either rollover all or part of their options for equivalent options in Prudential shares or to take no action.
Employees could adopt different courses of actions for options granted on different dates but may only adopt one course of action in respect of each grant of options.
The rollover was based on D employees receiving 0.2237 Prudential shares for each Egg share that was under option with total amount payable for the new Prudential shares being exactly the same as the total amount payable for the Egg shares.
In addition, all outstanding executive share options became exercisable and awards under the RSP were assessed against the performance conditions.
None of the awards met the performance conditions and they have therefore lapsed in February 2006 following consideration E of the performance measurement results by the Remuneration Committee.
At 31 December 2006, SAYE options to acquire 135,003 Egg shares remains outstanding because certain employees chose not to take any action.
In 2005, the Group maintained three main share award and share option plans relating to Egg shares, which are described below.
F Awards of shares were made under the RSP at no cost to eligible employees selected by the Remuneration Committee.
All Eggs directors and employees, including employees of its subsidiaries, were eligible to participate, subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
It was, however, intended that participation would, in practice, be restricted to selected individuals in key positions.
Employees within two years of their anticipated retirement date were not eligible to participate, except in circumstances which the Remuneration Committee considered to be exceptional.
G Egg established a discretionary employee benefit trust, the Egg Employee Trust, by a trust deed dated 26 April 2000 between Egg and Mourant & Co. Trustees Limited.
At 31 December 2005, the trust held 3.4 million ordinary shares with a market value of 4.2 million which were intended to be used principally for delivery of shares under the employee incentive plans.
These shares with a nominal value of 1.7 million were purchased on the open market at a cost of 4.5 million.
H Egg made the vesting of awards subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions from January 2004 onwards.
Previously, the awards had been conditional on service completed.
The arrangements for the distribution to employees of shares held in trust and for entitlement to dividend depended on the particulars of each award.
Shares held in trust were conditionally gifted to employees.
The costs of share awards were charged to the income statement evenly over the period of service for which awards were made for schemes granted after I 7 November 2002.
Egg also operated a sharesave scheme, which was an Inland Revenue approved all-employee Save as You Earn scheme.
Under this scheme, employees entered into either three or five year contracts, at the end of which time they would be entitled to exercise their options and purchase shares at an exercise price fixed at a 20 per cent discount to the share price at the date of grant.
Employees had six months after the contract matured in which to exercise the options.
These options continued in force until their normal maturity dates.

Each subsidiary has one class of ordinary shares and operates mainly in its country of incorporation, except for PRIL which operates mainly in England and Wales.
In January 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into a binding agreement to sell Egg Banking plc to Citi as set out in note I8.
D ii Dividend restrictions and minimum capital requirements Certain Group subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise to the parent company.
UK insurance companies are required to maintain solvency margins which must be supported by capital reserves and other resources, including unrealised gains on investments.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus E unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, without the prior regulatory approval, dividends cannot be distributed if all dividends made within the preceding 12 months exceed the greater of Jacksons statutory net gain from operations or 10 per cent of Jackson statutory surplus for the prior year.
In 2007, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by Jackson without prior regulatory approval is US$412 million 211 million in 2006: US$565 million 329 million.
The Groups Asian subsidiaries, mainly the Singapore and Malaysia businesses, may remit dividends to the Group, in general, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital F adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations.
PAC and Jackson are the two principal insurance subsidiaries of the Group, which together comprise approximately 76 per cent 2005: 77 per cent of total Group assets.
At 31 December 2006, the PAC long-term funds excess of available capital resources over its regulatory requirement as per line 42 of Form 2 of the PAC FSA regulatory returns was estimated to be 9.7 billion 2005: 6.0 billion G and the statutory capital and surplus of Jackson was US$3.7 billion 1.9 billion 2005: US$3.4 billion 2.0 billion.
The Group capital position statement for life assurance businesses is set out in note D5.
iii Acquisition of subsidiaries 2006 H In December 2005, the Company announced its intention to acquire the minority interests in Egg representing approximately 21.7 per cent of the existing issued share capital of Egg.
The whole of the minority interests were acquired in the first half of 2006.
Under the terms of the offer, Egg shareholders received 0.2237 new ordinary shares in the Company for each Egg share resulting in the issue of 41.6 million new shares in the Company.
I The Company accounts for the purchase of minority interests using the economic entity method.
Accordingly, 167 million has been charged to retained earnings representing the difference between the consideration paid including expenses of 251 million and the share of net assets acquired of 84 million.
In January 2007, as described in note I8, the Company announced that it had agreed to sell its holding in Egg.
2005 On 18 May 2005, the Group purchased, in exchange for 142 million in cash, 100 per cent of the share capital of Life Insurance Company of Georgia, a life insurance company domiciled in the US, from ING Groep N. V. ING.
The results of Life Insurance Company of Georgias operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements commencing 18 May 2005, and contributed 4 million to the consolidated net profit.

I I11: 2005 balance sheet Reanalysis of assets and liabilities for acquired venture investment subsidiaries of the PAC with-profits sub-fund Prior to 2006, no intangible assets other than goodwill had been identified for the acquired venture investment subsidiaries of the PAC with-profits sub-fund.
In 2006, the Group re-evaluated the nature of the acquired assets and liabilities of those companies and has determined that there are some intangible assets that fall under the scope of IAS 38, Intangible Assets, and require separate identification.
The Group has consequently altered the allocation between goodwill, intangible assets, and other assets and liabilities.
No adjustment to the profits or amounts recorded for the individual line items in the income statement for 2005 was necessary.
Accordingly, this reallocation has no effect on 2005 profit before or after tax or on shareholders equity at 31 December 2005.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the balances presented in the comparative balance sheet at 31 December 2005 to conform this balance sheet to the current presentation as a result of this reallocation.
The impact of the reclassifications is as follows: m Intangible assets attributable to the PAC with-profits sub-fund: Goodwill 188 Other intangible assets 260 Other debtors 13 Unallocated surplus of with-profits funds 27 Deferred tax liabilities 86 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 239
