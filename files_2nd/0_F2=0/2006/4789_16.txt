PAGE 49 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL REPORT 2006 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 50 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION From 1 October 2005 Dimension Data Holdings plc Dimension Data is required to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Commission EC, following the adoption of Regulation No.
1606 2002 by the European Parliament on 19 July 2002.
Dimension Data previously prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The adjustments required to convert the UK GAAP reported information into IFRS are set out in Note 41.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its consolidated financial statements.
The Group was required to set out its IFRS accounting policies as at 30 September 2006 and, in general, apply these policies retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at its date of transition, 1 October 2004.
The significant IFRS accounting policies are set out in Note 2.
IFRS 1 provides a number of optional exceptions to this general principle.
The most significant of these are set out below, together with a description in each case of the exception adopted by the Group.
Business combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to past business combinations that occurred before the date of transition 1 October 2004.
Cumulative translation differences The Group has elected to reset the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
The gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any foreign operation shall exclude translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS and shall include later translation differences.
Share-based payment The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment retrospectively to equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002.
Restating comparative information for financial instruments The Group has taken advantage of the option not to apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to its comparative information.
The Group has applied these statements prospectively from 1 October 2005.
Leases The Group has elected not to apply IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease retrospectively.
Fair value of property, plant and equipment The Group has elected to continue to recognise all property, plant and equipment PPE at its historical UK GAAP carrying value on transition and not to measure any item of PPE at fair value at 1 October 2004 with one exception, where the Group has elected to use the fair value of the item as its deemed cost at the transition date.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Whilst these estimates and assumptions are based on the Directors' best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: Pronouncement Effective year end for Dimension Data IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and concurrent amendment to IAS 1 to add capital disclosures 30 September 2008 IAS 21 2005 amendment for net investment in a foreign entity 30 September 2007 IAS 39 2005 revision for fair value option and guarantees 30 September 2007 IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease 30 September 2007 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 30 September 2007 IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 30 September 2007 The Directors are in the process of evaluating the measurement and disclosure requirements that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations will have in future periods when the relevant standards come into effect for the Group.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies set out below have been used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
These include accounting policies for financial instruments applied both before and after the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities including special purpose entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interest of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding legal obligation and is able to make additional investment to cover the losses.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 NonCurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less cost to sell.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Interests in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale see below.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associate in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
PAGE 51 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL REPORT 2006 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 52 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on contracts see below.
Maintenance revenue and licence fees are brought to account over the relevant contract periods.
Where the Group acts as agent and is remunerated on a commission basis, the commission is included in revenue.
Where the Group acts as principal, the total value of business handled is included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Contracts Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue, and they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Contact centre revenue is recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract by reference to the value of work performed.
The amount by which revenue differs from payments on account is shown under receivables as accrued revenue, or under payables as deferred revenue, as appropriate.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
PAGE 52 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 53 All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessor Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Groups net investment in the leases.
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Groups net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group as lessee Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of primary economic environment in which the entity operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has elected to present its results in US dollars as this is the currency predominantly used when the Group transacts.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and associates that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date before they are translated into US dollars.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment in specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants Government grants towards staff re-training costs are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
PAGE 53 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL REPORT 2006 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 54 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit Profit from operations is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items of financial performance that are material and non-recurring in nature that the Group believes should be disclosed separately within the financial statements to assist in the understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to statemanaged retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the depreciable value of the assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Capitalised property finance lease 2% per annum Leasehold land, buildings and improvements Over the lease term Computer and workshop equipment 14% 33% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum Office furniture and equipment 10% per annum PAGE 54 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 55 Certain costs of purchase, development and installation of major information systems including packaged software are capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives generally three to five years on a straight line basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets Other purchased intangible assets, which include customer lists and intellectual property, are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
Computer software Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
Acquired computer software is capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of between three to five years.
The SAP software is written off over seven years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred unless they increase the future economic benefits of the asset, in which case they are capitalised.
Internally generated computer software is capitalised at cost if the project is technically and commercially feasible and the economic benefits that are expected to be generated exceed one year.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific assets to which it relates.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight line basis between three and seven years.
Internally-generated intangible assets research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups Solutions business is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: An asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives, generally between three and five years.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Patents and trademarks Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
PAGE 55 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL REPORT 2006 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 56 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments UK GAAP accounting policies applicable up to 30 September 2005 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the income statement, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups financial statements.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Financial instruments IFRS accounting policies applicable from 1 October 2005 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
At subsequent reporting dates, debt securities that the Group has the expressed intention and ability to hold to maturity heldto-maturity debt securities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, and is measured as the difference between the investments carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods when an increase in the investments recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, subject to the restriction that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
PAGE 56 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 57 Investments other than held-to-maturity debt securities are classified as either investments held for trading or as available for sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period.
For available for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for equity investments classified as available for sale are not subsequently reversed through the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for debt instruments classified as available for sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried in the parent Company balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairments.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for borrowing costs see above.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
On conversion of the instruments the value of the debt is transferred to equity reserves.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions.
Such derivatives are initially recorded at fair value, if any, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the PAGE 57 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL REPORT 2006 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 58 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of designated fair value hedges and derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made for the amount of the obligation.
Where the effect of discounting to present value is material, provisions are adjusted to reflect the time value of money.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Following the interpretation of IFRIC 8, the Group has extended the scope of IFRS 2 to include the Groups black economic empowerment initiative.
The fair value of the shares issued pursuant to the Groups BEE initiative has been expensed with a corresponding increase in equity.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management uses all available information and the application of judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates.
Actual results in the future could differ from these estimates, and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect in income at the time such information becomes available.
Revenue and profit recognition Revenue and profit on contracts are generally recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably.
Management is required to use judgement in determining whether a contract's outcome can be estimated reliably.
Management also makes estimates of total contract costs, which are used in determining the value of amounts recoverable on contracts.
PAGE 58 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 59 Share-based payment The expense for the share schemes is determined by estimating the fair value of the options granted.
Details of the valuation methods and assumptions used are set out in Note 37.
Provision for bad debts Provision is made for bad debts based on management's estimate of the prospect of recovering the debt.
Where management has determined that a debt is no longer recoverable, the amount is written off.
Provision for inventory Inventory is counted at least once a year and any shortages and obsolete stock identified are written off immediately.
An allowance is made for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical trends.
Provision against slow moving and obsolete stock at 30 September 2006 amounted to $80.5 million 2005: $72.7 million.
Impairment of goodwill Management is required to estimate whether or not goodwill has been impaired.
This requires estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the cash-generating units, including management's estimates of long term operating margins and long term growth rates.
Income taxes Management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
When the final outcome of such matters is different, or expected to be different, from previous assessments made by management, a change to the tax provision will be recorded in the period when that decision is made.
REVENUE The Group's revenue is analysed as follows: Sale of goods 1,876,446 1,637,236 Services rendered 1,190,650 1,008,847 3,067,096 2,646,083 Other operating income 35,385 33,892 Investment income 13,020 15,471 3,115,501 2,695,446 Previously the Group presented the amounts invoiced on the sale of certain software product, the resale of vendor maintenance contracts, and certain product sales where the Groups role is restricted to that of a logistics agent, as gross revenue in the income statement.
As these types of arrangements become an increasingly significant feature of the Group's operating model, it is now believed to be more appropriate to reflect the commission earned on such transactions as revenue and not the gross sales value.
Consequently, in the current period, the Group changed its revenue recognition accounting policy to account for these transactions as agent, rather than as principal, and to report the net rather than the gross revenue.
The comparative reported revenue figures were restated accordingly.
This had the effect of decreasing revenue and cost of sales by $81.8 million in 2005.
This change in accounting policy has had no impact on operating profit.

GEOGRAPHIC AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS From 1 October 2005, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe have been managed as one region.
The comparative information has been restated to reflect this change.
Geographic segments For management purposes, the Group is organised regionally and these regions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Geographic segment information about these regions is presented below.
Inter-company sales are charged at prevailing market prices.
Network Integration is the Group's most significant line of business.
The other global lines of business focus on high growth markets, where the Group is well positioned to compete.
Regional represents operations that are complementary to our other global lines of business in the territories in which they operate, but are unique to those territories.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT continued The movement in impairment relates mainly to the Africa segment.
The carrying amount of land and buildings in respect of assets held under finance lease amounts to $106.6 million 2005: $131.4 million.
The land and buildings consist of Dimension Data leased property, located in South Africa.
The land portion of $9.3 million 2005: $11.3 million is not depreciated.
The land and buildings are encumbered as security for the finance lease refer to Note 25.
A portion of the land and buildings, being the space occupied by third party tenants and the space not occupied, was subject to impairment.
The market value used during the impairment consideration was based on the current estimated realisable value of the land and buildings.
The value used in the impairment calculation has been determined based on a valuation completed by management.

There has been no impairment to goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group has prepared forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors.
The discount rates used range between 10.1% to 15.1%.
Growth factors applied to expected earnings were between 10% to 20%.
These rates are consistent with growth rates in the industry that the Group operates.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE The Group is in the process of negotiating the sale of the Merchants Netherlands operations.
These operations, which are expected to be sold within twelve months, have been classified as a disposal group held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet.
The operations are included as part of the CIS business.
The proceeds on disposal are expected to exceed the net book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on these assets.
The assets and liabilities attributable to these operations have been classified as held for sale and are presented separately in the balance sheet.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the group classified as held for sale are as follows: 2006 $000 Non-current assets 2,306 Current assets 9,059 Total assets 11,365 Current liabilities 2,222 Net assets of disposal group 9,143 2006 2005 Number of shares $'000 Number of shares $'000 22.

CONVERTIBLE LOAN NOTES On 31 December 2002, ten seven year unsecured convertible bonds the bonds of $10 million each were issued to provide working capital for the Group.
The bonds were issued by Howper 266 Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Dimension Data and were unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Company.
The bonds were purchased by R&V Technology Holdings R&V, previously a subsidiary of VenFin Limited, an investment holding company incorporated in South Africa, previously listed on JSE Limited, South Africa.
On 26 May 2006, R&V elected to convert its $100 million convertible bonds into 188,121,978 Dimension Data ordinary shares.
On conversion, the additional shares amounted to 12.2% of the totalled issued share capital of the Company.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the loan have been split between the liability element and an equity component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, as follows: 2006 $000 At 1 October 2005 per UK GAAP 105,405 IFRS adjustment 4,836 At 1 October 2005 restated 100,569 Interest charged 1,722 Interest paid 5,375 Transferred to equity 96,879 Exchange differences 37 The interest charge for the year was calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 7.0 per cent to the liability component for the three month period to 31 December 2005.
In terms of the original agreement, on conversion, interest including the redemption premium no longer accrued after the last payment date, being 31 December 2005, and accordingly has not been charged.
The shares extinguishing the debt were issued on 26 May 2006.

The lease incorporates interest at 16.79%.
The current monthly lease payments of $1.2 million are payable in advance and escalate at 11% per annum.
The Company acts as surety and guarantor against any default.
In addition, the obligation under the finance lease is secured by the lessor's title over the leased assets.
The minimum lease payments do not service the interest until 2010.
Accordingly, no capital will be repaid for the first seven years.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: Deferred tax assets 30,737 9,590 Deferred tax liabilities 2,048 6,438 28,689 3,152 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $814.4 million 2005: $840.9 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $32.8 million 2005: $3.4 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining $781.6 million 2005: $837.5 million due to the unpredictability of the future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of $1.9 million 2005: $3.1 million that will expire within five years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with translation differences on loan accounts of subsidiaries included in equity for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was $33.2 million 2005: $37.2 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
There are additional tax consequences associated with the Companys investments in subsidiaries and associates but these are not practicably determinable.

ACQUISITIONS INCREASE IN HOLDINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES On 3 November 2005, Dimension Data South Africa acquired, for $18.0 million in cash, the remaining 51% stake in Plessey, a project management and service provider in the telecommunications market throughout the African continent, thereby increasing the interest held to 100%.
The carrying amounts of each class of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities were determined provisionally in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Subsequently, these provisional allocations were reassessed and adjustments of $0.5 million were made to liabilities acquired relating to understated tax provisions.
The adjusted amounts are as follows: $ million Non-current assets 3 Inventories 17 Trade and other receivables 24 Cash and cash equivalents 17 Short term liabilities 35 Provisions 1 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition Cash consideration 18 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 17 1 Due to the nature of the underlying business, there were no specific intangible assets to which value could be assigned.
Goodwill of $4.7 million arose on this acquisition.
Since the acquisition date, the amount of Plesseys revenue and profit after tax included in the Group income statement was $95.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period, the amount of revenue and profit after tax that would have been included in the income statement would have been $100.2 million and $4.6 million respectively.
In addition, with effect from 28 February 2006, Dimension Data South Africa acquired the remaining 20% in Internet Solutions for a cash consideration of $42.6 million.
This entity was already accounted for as a subsidiary in the prior periods.
This acquisition gave rise to goodwill amounting to $30.7 million.
The other acquisitions made by the Group during the year were not material.
OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS The Group as lessee At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: Within one year 29,031 24,264 In the second to fifth years inclusive 52,149 42,700 After five years 11,179 12,045 92,359 79,009 PAGE 76 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 77 Restated 2006 2005 $000 $000 31.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued 37 a Dimension Datas schemes Dimension Data Holdings plc share option scheme Post 2000 The Dimension Data Holdings plc share option scheme Post 2000 provides for the grant of share options to employees.
The share options granted vest in four tranches from the option grant date as follows: A quarter of the options granted vest after one year: A further quarter of the options granted vest after two years: A further quarter of the options granted vest after three years: and The final quarter of the options vest after four years.
The vesting of the options is subject to various non-market performance criteria.
Such performance criteria vary between option holders.
All options expire after 10 years from grant date.
Number of options on ordinary shares in the Company outstanding in terms of the option schemes 2006 2005 Opening balance 128,528,762 153,018,535 Exercised and paid 6,958,382 2,598,125 Lapsed 9,622,307 21,891,648 Closing balance 111,948,073 128,528,762 Total weighted average price for options exercised and paid was R6.71 and 0.27.

Share Appreciation Rights The Share Appreciation Rights SARS provide the employees, at the date the rights vest, with the right to receive shares equal to the appreciation in the share price since grant date.
The share appreciation rights all vest three years after the grant date.
All SARS expire after six years from grant date.
They will receive an amount equal to the increase in value between the grant date and the exercise date.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued 37 a Dimension Datas schemes continued Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP provides the employees, at the date the rights are exercised, the right to receive shares as stipulated by the grant certificate.
The LTIPs vest in one tranche, approximately three years after the grant date at the end of the performance period.
The vesting of the LTIP is subject to market performance conditions.
These market performance conditions vary between individuals.
The performance condition provides for the vesting of shares based on the relative total shareholder return TSR of Dimension Data to that of each of a group of peer companies.
All LTIPs expire on vesting date, i. e. three years from date of grant.
They will be awarded rights to ordinary shares in the Company.
Valuation methods The fair value of the options granted in terms of the Dimension Data Holdings plc share option scheme and SARs are estimated using an actuarial binomial option pricing model.
The key principles of the actuarial binomial model are as follows: Risk neutral valuation: The underlying share price is assumed to follow log-normal distribution of returns: Stock returns are independently distributed: A risk-free rate can be earned and is known in advance: The market is efficient and thus investors cannot make risk-free profits: and The underlying share price follows a markov process i. e. where the share price has been in the past does not have a bearing as to where it will be in the future.
The Monte Carlo Simulation process for the LTIP valuation is used to model a real life situation with stochastic properties.
An example of such a process is the movement in share prices.
Share prices have an underlying distribution, which could be estimated and used to calculate likely distribution of future share prices.
Taking into account the expected growth in share price, assuming a log-normal distribution, the model projects the future share prices.
The key assumptions influencing the share price growth would be the risk-free rate and the volatility of that share price.
Inputs into the model The following inputs were used to value the options granted: Dimension Data Holdings plc Share Option Scheme Post 2000 issued on the JSE Limited South Africa Financial Weighted Exercise Expected Expected years average price at  risk-free ended share price grant date lifetime volatility yield interest rate 30 September R R years % % % 2003 3.94 3.71 7 59.2 62.4 10.06 11.12 2004 4.03 4.03 7 63.7 9.69 No changes to assumptions were made subsequent to 2004.

The estimated attrition rate for SARS and LTIPs was between 6% to 10% 2005: 10%.
The expected volatility was determined based on the rolling historical volatility over the expected option lifetime that prevailed at the grant date.
The risk-free interest rate used is the yield on the zero-coupon South African government bonds and a UK gilt strip of a term consistent with the expected option lifetime.
Modification to share-based payments For options which were originally granted on 21 November 2002 under the Dimension Data Holdings Plc Share Option Scheme Post 2000, the vesting dates of 20,754,173 options were altered on 21 November 2003.
These options now vest over three tranches as follows: 50% of the options granted vest on 21 November 2004: A further 25% of the options granted vest on 21 November 2005: and The final 25% vest on 21 November 2006.
The incremental fair value of $1.8 million was the increase in the value under the new vesting terms as valued at the date of modification.
This incremental fair value was determined using the actuarial binomial model.
The principal inputs used in determining the incremental fair value is detailed in the table below: Weighted Exercise Expected Expected average price at option Expected dividend UK risk-free share price grant date lifetime volatility yield interest rate years % % % 0.35 0.25 7 63.7 4.99 PAGE 81 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL REPORT 2006 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 82 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 37.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued 37 b Datacraft Asias Datacraft schemes Datacraft has two share option schemes, namely the Previous Scheme and the Scheme 2003.
The Previous Scheme was adopted in 1996.
During the financial year ended 30 September 2003, the Previous Scheme was terminated and replaced by the Scheme 2003.
The termination of the Previous Scheme does not affect the rights of outstanding options granted under the Previous Scheme.
Such options continue to be exercisable in accordance with the rules of the Previous Scheme.
However, upon the termination of the Previous Scheme on 27 February 2003, no further options were granted under the Previous Scheme.
The Previous Scheme and Scheme 2003 are administered by the Share Option Committee.

The option period for options granted prior to 20 January 2006 is 10 years, except for those options granted to non-executive directors of Datacraft, subsidiaries and associated companies which carry a 5 year option period.
The options, to the extent unexercised, shall unless the Committee administering the Previous Scheme or Scheme 2003 as the case may be otherwise determines in accordance with the rules of the respective schemes lapse upon the employee ceasing to be employed by Datacraft or its subsidiaries.
On 20 January 2006, the shareholders of Datacraft approved certain modifications to the terms and conditions of the Previous Scheme and Scheme 2003.
For the Previous Scheme, Datacraft, in addition to allotting and issuing new shares to the participant upon the exercise of options, shall, at its discretion, also be able to deliver treasury shares: and or pay the equivalent value in cash to the participant in lieu of issuing or delivering shares to the participant.
The main modifications to the Scheme 2003 are as follows: The maximum option period is shortened from 10 years to 7 years for the options granted to the employees after 20 January 2006.
Existing options granted with a ten-year option period prior to 20 January 2006 will continue to have the same ten-year option period.
Performance targets are introduced as vesting conditions in addition to the above Service Conditions.

Such performance targets do not apply to non-executive directors.
The introduction of performance targets only affects new options granted after 20 January 2006.
Existing options granted under the Scheme 2003 continue to have only Service Conditions.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued 37 b Datacraft Asias schemes continued Datacraft, in addition to allotting and issuing new shares to participants upon the exercise of an option under the Scheme 2003, shall, at its discretion, also be able to deliver treasury shares: and or pay the equivalent value in cash to the participant in lieu of issuing or delivering shares to the participant.
The expected value of the aggregate of all options granted under the Scheme 2003, all awards granted under Datacraft Asia Performance Share Plan and all options and awards granted under any future share-based incentive schemes of Datacraft Share-based Incentives granted to an executive director or executive in any financial year shall not exceed that executive directors or executives basic annual salary determined by Datacraft in accordance with the rules of the Scheme 2003 as at the date falling immediately prior to the date of grant.
The aggregate expected value of all Share-based Incentives, valued at fair value as defined under IFRS 2 shall not exceed 10% of the aggregate annual basic salary costs of the Datacraft group in each financial year.

The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.4 years 2005: 6.4 years.
Details of the share options under the Scheme 2003 outstanding during the year are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average share options exercise price share options exercise price $$ Outstanding at the beginning of the year 11,884,000 0.982 6,438,000 1.147 Granted during the year 6,565,000 1.14 7,200,000 0.835 Exercised during the year 455,000 0.835 Lapsed during the year 2,258,000 1.012 1,754,000 0.983 Outstanding at the end of the year 15,736,000 1.048 11,884,000 0.982 Exercisable at the end of the year 3,348,250 1.060 1,400,500 1.147 The weighted average share price at the date of the exercise for share options exercised during the year was $1.050.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued 37 b Datacraft Asias schemes continued These fair values were calculated using the binominal option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: 2006 2005 Share price at date of grant 1.11 0.99 Exercise price 1.14 0.835 Expected volatility 43% 46% Contractual life 7 years 10 years Risk-free rate 4.60% to 4.71% 2.78% to 4.33% Expected dividend yield 1.2% 0 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of Datacrafts share price over the previous three years.
It was assumed that employees who voluntarily resign would have exercised their options before they resign if the share price at the point of exercise exceeds the exercise price.
It was further assumed that employees will only exercise their options if the share price at that moment exceeds the exercise price by 15% 2005:10%.
Performance Share Plan On 20 January 2006, the shareholders of Datacraft approved a new performance share plan Datacraft Asia Performance Share Plan under which awards of fully paid-up shares will be granted, free of payment, to selected employees, when and after pre-determined performance targets and or service conditions are accomplished.
The awards may be settled with new shares, treasury shares or cash or combinations thereof at the sole discretion of Datacraft.
No such performance shares were granted during the financial year.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Trade and other receivables The average credit period taken on sales of goods was 62 days 2005: 56 days.
An allowance has been made for the estimated irrecoverable trade receivables of $25.9 million 2005: $61.1 million.
The decrease in provision is largely as a result of the finalisation of Datacraft Asias insurance claim, where amounts not recoverable were written off against the bad debt provision previously established.
This allowance has been determined on specific receivables and by reference to past default experience.
No interest is charged on outstanding receivable balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Bank balances and cash These comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Trade and other payables Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases was 52 days 2005: 40 days.
The Directors consider the carrying value of trade payables to approximate their fair value.
Credit risk The Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Currency derivatives The Group hedges its transactional foreign exchange risk, using forward exchange contracts as soon as there is a firm contractual commitment.
Speculative use of financial instruments or derivatives is not permitted and none has occurred during any periods presented.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Currency derivatives continued At balance sheet date, total notional amounts outstanding in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are as below: 2006 $'000 Forward foreign exchange contracts These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the first half of FY2007, and are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
Fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts: Assets 4,580 Liabilities 737 3,843 These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at balance sheet date.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounting to $2.3 million has been deferred in equity.
Financial assets comprise: investments held for trading, available for sale investments, long and short term trade and other receivables excluding the provision for bad debts, tax authorities receivable, cash and cash equivalents, current asset portion of assets classified as held for sale and other financial instruments.
Financial liabilities comprise: convertible bonds, other long term liabilities, bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other payables, tax authorities payable, liabilities held for sale and other financial instruments.
Details of deferred consideration included in Other are set out on Note 24.
38 b Interest rates and currency profiles The main functional currency of the Group is the US dollar, being the currency in which the majority of purchases are denominated and to which most of the selling prices are linked.
Other major currencies are the South African rand, Sterling, Australian dollar and the Euro.
Monetary assets and liabilities are generally economically hedged and therefore there are limited transactional exposures that would give rise to net currency gains or losses in the income statement.

RECONCILIATION FROM UK GAAP TO IFRS continued An explanation of the impact of the material differences and resulting adjustments between UK GAAP and IFRS as they apply to Dimension Data's consolidated income statement and balance sheet is set out below: a PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group's primary financial statements are presented in accordance with IAS 1.
This impacts the presentation of the Group's share of the results of associate undertakings in the Group's consolidated income statement.
Under UK GAAP, the Group's share of associates' operating profit, interest and tax were separately disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
In accordance with IAS 1, associates' results are presented as a single line item.
b SHARE-BASED PAYMENT Employee share incentive schemes IFRS 2 requires that share-based instruments be expensed based on their fair value at the date of grant.
In the Group's case this relates to grants since 7 November 2002 under the Share Option Schemes, the Share Appreciation Rights Scheme and the Long Term Incentive Plan, both introduced in 2005, and the Datacraft Asia share incentive scheme.
The expense is recognised over the vesting period of the schemes.
The Group has adopted a stochastic model, based on the standard binomial options pricing model for the valuation of the grants under the Share Option Schemes, the grants under the Share Appreciation Rights Scheme and the Datacraft Asia share incentive scheme.
The value of the Long Term Incentive Plan awards has been calculated using Monte Carlo simulation methods.
An amount of $11.1 million was reallocated to reserves at the transition date.
An additional $6.7 million compared to UK GAAP was charged to the 2005 income statement as a result of the adoption of IFRS 2.
The balance sheet effects of the IFRS 2 adjustment at the transition date have not been separately disclosed, as the movements are within reserves.
Black Economic Empowerment BEE transaction The BEE transaction entered into by the Group in April 2004 is an equity-settled transaction which is accounted for under IFRS 2.
The fair value of the goods and services received in terms of this transaction was determined by the Group as being $38.3 million and this value was transferred from opening retained earnings to other reserves under IFRS 2. c VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS Under UK GAAP, the Group's venture capital investments were stated at valuation in terms of the standards endorsed by the British Venture Capital Association.
Investments were assessed annually for impairment and valuation losses written off to operating profit, while no account was taken of valuation surpluses.
Where arm's length transactions provided external validation of valuations, surpluses and losses were included in operating profit.
Under IFRS, the following accounting policies now apply: Investments over which the Group has the ability to exert control are classified as subsidiaries and are consolidated IAS 27 'Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements' : Investments, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence, are classified as associates and are equity accounted IAS 28 'Investments in Associates' : and Investments which are not classified as subsidiaries or associates are carried at cost less impairment.
When IAS 39 was applied from 1 October 2005, these investments were carried at fair value.
An amount of $8.0 million was charged to reserves at the transition date.
Of this, $7.3 million is a result of equity accounting entities which are now classified as associates and $0.7 million is a result of consolidating losses in an entity that is now classified as a subsidiary.
An amount of $1.3 million was credited to the 2005 income statement under IFRS.
This is mainly a result of the deconsolidation in 2005 of losses of $0.1 million in a subsidiary where the majority of the shareholding was sold and an adjustment to equity accounted earnings mainly as a result of the reversal of goodwill amortisation in associates of $1.0 million.
PAGE 91 DIMENSION DATA ANNUAL REPORT 2006 336 DIDATA financials 12 5 06 1:24 PM Page 92 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 41.
RECONCILIATION FROM UK GAAP TO IFRS continued d CAPITALISATION OF CAMPUS LEASE Under IFRS, the Campus property lease in Johannesburg, South Africa is classified as a finance lease and capitalised from the inception date of the lease.
The adjustments resulting from the capitalisation are: Opening 2005 balance Income sheet statement Total Debit credit $million $million $million Reversal of operating lease expense 23.0 1.8 24.8 Financing expense 35.6 2.8 38.4 Depreciation expense 3.4 0.1 3.5 Adjustment to impairment expense 5.0 16.1 11.1 Adjustment to onerous lease provision 17.7 17.4 0.3 Interest on bare dominium freehold acquired 1.4 0.1 1.5 Adjustment to leasehold improvement depreciation 1.0 0.7 1.7 3.7 1.8 5.5 The adjustments made to the 2005 income statement were impacted by the purchase of the bare dominium freehold on 16 November 2004, which meant that the accounting treatment of the Campus lease under UK GAAP changed from that of an operating lease to a finance lease for the remainder of the 2005 financial year.
Had Dimension Data owned the bare dominium freehold for the full year, there would have been no material adjustments to the 2005 income statement relative to UK GAAP.
e HOLIDAY PAY As a result of guidance under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', and in order to accrue fully for the holiday pay liability, an amount of $2.3 million was charged to reserves at transition date and $0.4 million expensed in the 2005 income statement.
f LEASE ADJUSTMENTS In terms of IAS 17 'Leases', a property lease has been capitalised and a provision for refurbishment of a leased property has been raised.
Both of these adjustments occurred in Europe.
This has resulted in an expense of $0.2 million being charged against reserves at the transition date and $1.0 million being expensed in the 2005 income statement.
g GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTISATION IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' requires that goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment test.
As the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations prior to the opening balance sheet date, the UK GAAP net goodwill balance at 1 October 2004 of $1.0 million is no longer amortised.
As a result of the adoption of IFRS 3, $4.0 million of goodwill amortisation was credited to the Group's 2005 income statement.
This goodwill amortisation was mainly in respect of acquisitions completed during the 2005 financial year.
h RECLASSIFICATIONS Under UK GAAP, capitalised computer software was reflected as tangible fixed assets.
Under IFRS, only computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is reflected as such.
All other computer software is classified within intangible assets.
At 1 October 2004 a reclassification amounting to $6.7 million has been made from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets and at 30 September 2005 the reclassification amounted to $9.0 million.
An amount of $1.3 million was reclassified from goodwill to intangibles in accordance with IFRS 3 which requires intangible assets to be separately recognised in respect of acquisitions made by the Group.
In 2004 an amount of $10.9 million was reclassified from short term investments to cash and cash equivalents and at 30 September 2005 the reclassification amounted to $12.5 million.
These reclassifications are as a result of the definition in IAS 7 'Cash Flow Statements' of cash and cash equivalents being short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
In 2005 an amount of $3.1 million has been reclassified from current liabilities to equity in respect of the share incentive costs charged to the income statement under UK GAAP.
As this relates to equity-settled share incentive schemes, this credit is recorded in equity under IFRS.
i OTHER This adjustment of $1.8 million has been applied to tangible fixed assets at 1 October 2004 and arises mainly as a result of Dimension Data's decision to apply the provision of IFRS 1 allowing an entity to elect to measure an item of property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS at its fair value, and to use the fair value as its deemed cost at that date.
