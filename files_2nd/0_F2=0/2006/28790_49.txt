Quoted investments are designated as held at fair value under IFRS and are carried at bid prices whereas previously, under UK GAAP, they were carried at mid prices.
The aggregate difference is a downward revaluation of 1.1 million and this also decreases retained earnings by the same amount.
In accordance with UK GAAP, the retirement benefit asset was previously disclosed in the balance sheet net of attributable deferred taxation.
The rules contained in IAS 19, Employee benefits, now require the deferred taxation to be recorded separately.
In addition, actuarial gains and losses were previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses: under IAS 19, these items are now recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The deferred tax asset was previously included in current assets.
In accordance with IFRS, it has now been reclassified as a non-current asset and the restated amount now includes the deferred tax liability attributable to the retirement benefit asset.
The deferred tax balance has also been reduced because of a reduction in the SAR provision referred to below.
Under UK company law, companies were required to provide for their proposed dividend in advance of the dividend being declared and approved at the Annual General Meeting.
Under IAS 37, Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, the proposed dividend can no longer be provided for in the year end balance sheet since, at that date, the dividend did not represent a liability of the Company.
At 31 March 2005 accrued dividends of 4.8 million were removed from other liabilities.
Under IFRS 2, Share-based payment, a charge is required for all share-based payments which includes the long-term incentives provided under the Companys Share Appreciation Rights Plan SARs.
The charge in the Consolidated Income Statement is now based on the difference between the fair value of the SARs from one balance sheet date to the next.
Under UK GAAP, the profit and loss charge was based on the difference between the exercise price and the market price of RITCPs shares at the relevant balance sheet date.
In accordance with IFRS, a foreign currency translation reserve has now been recognised in respect of the exchange movements arising on consolidation since 31 March 2004. b Reconciliation of the Statement of Total Return to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 Under IFRS, the Consolidated Income Statement is the equivalent of the Consolidated Statement of Total Return reported previously.

Ordinary dividends declared and paid during the period are dealt with through the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The investment portfolios are required to be valued at fair value under IFRS.
In previous periods certain discounts were applied to the valuation of some quoted investments to take account of their illiquidity: these discounts have now been removed in accordance with IAS 39.
The restated values differ from the previous valuations by 0.7 million and 1.1 million respectively.
As mentioned above, the charge in respect of the SAR incentive plan has been reduced pursuant to the new IFRS 2 accounting treatment.
The actuarial gain on the pension scheme was previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses.
This adjustment comprises the aggregate of the deferred tax adjustment relating to the SARs provision and the movement in deferred tax relating to the pension scheme which was previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses.
