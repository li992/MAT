Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 1 General information The Severn Trent group has a number of operations.
These are described in the segmental analysis in note 4.
Severn Trent Plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered ofce is shown on the back of the cover of the annual report and accounts.
Severn Trent Plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
2 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Accounting Standards IAS and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective and ratied by the European Union as at 31 March 2006 and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
b First time adoption of IFRS The groups date of transition to IFRS is 1 April 2004 and all comparative information in the financial statements has been restated to reect the groups adoption of IFRS, except where otherwise required or permitted by International Financial Reporting Standard 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1.
Details of this transition are given in note 41.
IFRS 1 requires an entity to comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date for its first IFRS financial statements.
As a general principle, IFRS 1 requires the standards effective at the reporting date to be applied retrospectively, however, retrospective application is prohibited in some areas.
In addition, there are a number of optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRSs within IFRS 1.
Group policy on optional IFRS 1 exemptions is as follows: Not to apply International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3 retrospectively to past business combinations: To establish a deemed cost for the opening balance sheet carrying value of the water and wastewater infrastructure xed assets by reference to the fair value of these assets at the date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2004: To recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses relating to dened benefit pension schemes at the date of transition: To deem cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition: Not to apply the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2 to options granted under the groups Save As You Earn schemes prior to 7 November 2002.
The requirements of IFRS 2 have been applied to shares conditionally awarded under the groups Long Term Incentive Plan schemes before 7 November 2002 but not vested or lapsed before 1 April 2004 since the fair values of these awards has been publicly disclosed previously.
c Basis of consolidation The financial statements include the results of Severn Trent Plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identied separately from the groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since that date.
Losses attributable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the group has the power to control a subsidiary.
The results of joint venture undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis where the company exercised joint control under a contractual arrangement.
The results of associates are accounted for on an equity basis where the company holding is 20% or more and the company has the power to exercise significant inuence.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 57 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued d Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and inter-company sales, in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
Revenue is not recognised until the service has been provided to the customer, or the goods to which the sale relates have either been despatched to the customer or, where they are held on the customers behalf, title has passed to the customer.
In respect of long term contracts, revenue is recognised based on the value of work carried out during the year with reference to the total sales value and the stage of completion of these contracts.
Turnover includes an estimate of the amount of mains water and wastewater charges unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a dened methodology based upon a measure of unbilled water consumed by tariff, which is calculated from historical billing information.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Interest and dividend income are included in finance income.
e Segmental reporting Each of the groups business and geographical segments provide services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other business segments.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprises: i Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets are included at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS less accumulated depreciation.
The costs of day to day servicing of infrastructure components are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise.
Where it is probable that the money spent will cause future economic benets to ow to the group, then costs are capitalised.
Infrastructure assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives, which are as follows: Years Impounding reservoirs 250 Raw water aqueducts 250 Mains 80-150 Sewers 150-200 ii Landll sites Landll sites are included within Land and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of landll sites includes the cost of acquiring, developing and engineering sites, but does not include interest.
The cost of the asset is depreciated over the estimated life of the site on the basis of the usage of void space.
iii Other assets Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated over their estimated economic lives to their residual value, which are principally as follows: Years Buildings 30-60 Operational structures 40-80 Fixed plant 20-40 Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 2-15 Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
Interest costs of debt raised to finance new property, plant and equipment are not included within the cost of those xed assets, but are expensed to the income statement as they arise.
58 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Group financial statements g Leased assets Where assets are nanced by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments is capitalised as an asset with a corresponding liability representing the obligation to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and a finance charge, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor and the finance charge being written off to the income statement at a constant rate over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease period.
Where assets are nanced by leasing arrangements where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor, these are classied as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Leases of land are normally treated as operating leases, unless ownership is transferred at the end of the lease.
h Grants and contributions Grants and contributions received in respect of non-current assets, including charges made for new connections to the water and sewerage networks, are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the useful economic life of those assets.
Where grants and contributions are given for the purpose of compensation for expenses incurred with no future related costs, then these are recognised in the income statement in the period that they become receivable.
i Impairment of non-current assets If the recoverable amount of goodwill, an item of property, plant and equipment, or any other non-current asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or estimated value in use at the date the impairment review is undertaken.
Fair value less costs to sell represents the amount obtainable from the sale of the assets in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing third parties, less costs of disposal.
Value in use represents the present value of future cash ows expected to be derived from a cash generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the cost of capital of the cash generating unit or asset.
The discount rate used is based on the groups cost of capital adjusted for the risk proles of individual businesses.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Impairment reviews are also carried out if there is some indication that an impairment may have occurred, or, where otherwise required, to ensure that non-current assets are not carried above their estimated recoverable amounts.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement.
j Investments The group followed the transitional provisions of IFRS and adopted International Accounting Standard 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 and International Accounting Standard 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 from 1 April 2005.
After initial recognition at cost being the fair value of the consideration paid, investments which are classied as held for trading or available for sale are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognised in income or equity respectively.
When an available for sale investment is disposed of, or impaired, the gain or loss previously recognised in equity is taken to the income statement.
Other investments are classied as held to maturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Investments held for an undefined period are excluded from this classication.
Such investments and those held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with any gains or losses being recognised in the income statement.
Prior to 1 April 2005, the group held investments at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 59 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued k Inventory Inventory and work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and attributable overheads.
Development land and properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites.
The net realisable value of development land is based upon its value as a serviced site, after taking account of the cost of providing infrastructure services.
Income and attributable profits on properties under development are determined by reference to valuation of work carried out to date.
l Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of, cash and which are subject to an insignicant risk of change in value.
Such investments are normally those with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition, and include cash and balances at central banks, treasury bills and other eligible bills, loans and certicates of deposit.
Cash and cash equivalents also include overdrafts repayable on demand.
m Provisions Provisions are made where there is a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be an outow of economic benets to settle this obligation and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made.
The groups policy on provisions for specic areas is as follows: Landll restoration costs: Provision for the cost of restoring landll sites is made over the operational life of each landll site and charged to the income statement on the basis of the usage of void space.
Environmental control and aftercare costs: Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred over the operational life of each landll site and may be incurred for a considerable period thereafter.
Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the profit and loss account on the basis of the usage of void space.
Material environmental control and aftercare costs are discounted by applying an appropriate discount rate.
Insurance: Provision is made for claims notied and for claims incurred but which have not yet been notied, based on advice from the groups independent insurance advisers.
n Pension costs The group operates both dened benefit and dened contribution pension schemes.
Dened benefit pension scheme assets are measured using bid price.
Dened benefit pension scheme liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the groups dened benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in other finance income or cost.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to pension plans are charged or credited to equity and recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Costs of dened contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
o Foreign currency The results of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into the presentational currency of the group, sterling, using average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
The net investments in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
Exchange differences thus arising are treated as movements in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity since 1 April 2004 under the transitional rule of IFRS 1 see note 2b relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement Exchange differences arising in respect of foreign exchange instruments taken out as hedges of overseas investments are also treated as movements in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective see note 2u.
All other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the company and its United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the income statement.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
All profits and losses on exchange arising during the year are dealt with through the income statement.
60 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Group financial statements p Research and development Research expenditure is expensed when it is incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised and written off over its expected useful economic life where the following criteria are met: An asset is created that can be identied: It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benets: and The development cost can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on property, plant and equipment relating to research and development projects is capitalised and written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
q Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on taxable temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise it.
Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have then been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
r Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets, whilst goodwill arising on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates.
If an acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill this is credited directly to the income statement.
Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves under UK GAAP and remains eliminated against reserves.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is treated as an intangible xed asset.
Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy set out above and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit that derives benefit from the goodwill for impairment testing purposes.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition, if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of that operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
s Intangible non-current assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the historical cost model is applied to intangible assets.
Amortisation charged on assets with nite lines is taken to the income statement through operating expenses.
Finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Years Software 3-10 Other assets 2-20 Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
t Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at fair value on initial recognition and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method unless there there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired where it is written down to is recoverable amount and the irrecoverable amount is recognised as an expense.
Non-current assets classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Depreciation is not charged on such assets.
u Financial instruments The group has taken advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption from application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 has applied these standards from 1 April 2005.
Comparative information for financial instruments has been presented in accordance with the UK Financial Reporting Standard 13 Financial Instruments.
Under this Standard derivative financial instruments were recognised at historical cost and were not remeasured at fair value except that, where currency swaps were used to hedge foreign currency investments, the future currency exchange in such contracts was revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the related gain or loss was taken directly to equity.
The accounting policy after 1 April 2005 is as follows: i Debt instruments All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the net fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where a loan or borrowing is in a fair value hedging relationship it is remeasured for changes in fair value of the hedged risk at the balance sheet date with gains or losses being recognised in the income statement see below.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 61 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued u Financial instruments continued ii Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency swaps, forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate uctuations.
Such derivative instruments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is taken to the income statement where the effective portion of the hedge will offset the gain or loss on the hedged item see above.
In relation to cash ow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or rm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
Forward currency contracts and foreign currency borrowings are used to hedge net investments in foreign currency denominated operations and to the extent that they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against changes in value of the related assets.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that date any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, or transferred to the income statement if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with gains and losses reported in the income statement.
The accounting policy prior to 1 April 2005 is as follows: iii Debt instruments The financial costs of debt instruments are charged to the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Such costs include the cost of issue and any discount to face value arising on issue, or any premium arising on maturity.
Differences arising from the movement in exchange rates during the year on translation into sterling of the foreign currency borrowings and similar instruments used to finance long-term equity investments, are taken directly to equity and reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
iv Derivative financial instruments Financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and to a lesser extent currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the group and the nancing of those activities.
There is no trading activity in financial instruments.
Financial instruments are accounted for as follows: interest rate swaps are used to hedge the groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
currency swaps are used to hedge foreign currency investments.
The future currency exchange within such contracts is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and any unrealised gain or loss is matched with that on the underlying asset or liability in reserves.
The interest coupon on such swaps is accrued in the same way as that on borrowings and deposits.
v Share-based payments The group operates a number of equity settled, share-based compensation plans for employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
The fair value of employee services is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted calculated using an appropriate pricing model, excluding the impact of any non market vesting conditions.
The number of awards that are expected to vest takes into account non market vesting conditions including, where appropriate, continuing employment by the group.
The change is adjusted to reect shares that do not vest as a result of failing to meet a non-market condition.
w Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred, except where it is virtually certain that the contract will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset which is written off to the income statement over the life of the contract.
62 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Group financial statements x Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Where an asset or group of assets a disposal group is available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable and expected to occur within one year, then the disposal group is deemed as held for sale.
The disposal group is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Where a group of assets a component, which comprises operations that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the group, has been disposed of or classied as held for sale, and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale then the component is classied as a discontinued operation.
y Purchase of own shares The group balance sheet incorporates the shares held by the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust the Trust and which have not vested unconditionally by the balance sheet date.
These are shown as a deduction from shareholders funds until such time as they vest.
z Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expenses that are taxable in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
aa Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
ab Exceptional items Exceptional items are income or expenditure, which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or nature if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
3 New accounting policies and future requirements The following statements have been issued by the International Accounting Standard Board and are likely to affect future financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standard 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures IFRS 7 was issued in August 2005 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2007.
The standard incorporates the disclosure requirements of IAS 32, which it supersedes, and adds further quantitative and qualitative disclosures in relation to financial instruments.
International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee Interpretation 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease IFRIC 4 was issued in December 2004 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2006.
The interpretation requires arrangements that may have the nature, but not the legal form, of a lease to be accounted for in accordance with International Accounting Standard 17 Leases.
This interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the group.
The directors assess that the other standards issued but not yet effective are not applicable to the group.
4 Segmental analysis The group is organised into four main business segments: Water and Sewerage Provides water and sewerage services to domestic and commercial customers in England and Wales.
Waste Management Provides collection, landll and special waste services to industrial and commercial customers and local authorities in the UK.

Other Businesses Include IT Services and Solutions, Engineering Consultancy, Severn Trent Property and Derwent Insurance.
The external IT services and Engineering Consultancy activities were sold or terminated during the year.
The group is also organised into geographical regions, UK, US and Europe.

The xed interest rates vary from 4.37% to 6.45%.
The main oating rate is LIBOR.
Included within this are interest rate swaps with a notional value of 850 million which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The group has an ongoing debt requirement and these swaps aim to x the interest rates paid on a portfolio of variable debt of various terms.
As it is not possible to specically match these swaps to individual debt instruments, they do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Cross currency swaps The notional principal amounts of the outstanding cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2006 was 467.6 million.
These swap a variety of currencies into sterling.
Hedge of net investments in foreign entities The groups US dollar cross currency swap is designated as a hedge of net investment in the groups US subsidiaries.

The groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of surplus funds.
i Market risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
In addition, the group has a significant value of foreign currency debt, primarily in US dollars, yen and euros.
Foreign exchange risk arises when transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency debt the group enters into cross currency swaps with external parties.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated at group level and company level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specic assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The groups risk management policy is to hedge 100% of all foreign currency denominated debt.
The group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the groups foreign operations is managed through borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
ii Credit risk Operationally, the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to continue to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
For nancing purposes, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
iii Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain exibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
iv Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain over 50% of its borrowings in xed rate instruments.
Currently some 72% of the groups net debt is xed.
The group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by using oating to xed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals mainly semi-annually, the difference between xed contract and oating rate interest rates calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future debt.
Economically these act to x oating rate debt within the group, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a charge of 36.7 million in the income statement in 2005 06. j Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as trading and available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over the counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Estimated discounted cash ows are used to determine fair value for the debt.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rate that is available to the group for similar financial instruments.

Hence the investments are held at cost.
It is not possible to determine a range of estimates within which the fair values are highly likely to lie.

84 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Group financial statements 27 Retirement benefit schemes Dened benefit schemes The group operates a number of dened benefit pension schemes in the UK, covering the majority of UK employees.
The dened benefit schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out at regular intervals by an independent professionally qualied actuary.
Under the dened benefit schemes, members are entitled to retirement benets calculated as a proportion varying between one thirtieth and one eightieth for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of employment.
The final salary sections of all four of the pension schemes listed below are closed to new entrants and the age prole of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise in the future.
The UK dened benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: UK dened benefit scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension Scheme STPS 31 March 2004 Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme 31 March 2004 UK Waste Pension Scheme 6 April 2003 Severn Trent Water Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2003 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK dened benefit schemes.
Benets are also provided by the group on an unfunded, unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989, whose benets would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.

No liability is expected to arise in respect of either bonds or guarantees.
b Regulatory matters In May 2004 an employee of Severn Trent Water raised a number of allegations relating, in particular, to alleged accounting inaccuracies and regulatory returns.
On 31 October 2005, as a result of a referral by Ofwat, the Serious Fraud Ofce SFO informed the Company that it was undertaking a criminal investigation into alleged reporting irregularities made to Ofwat by Severn Trent Water Limited between 2000 and 2003.
Ofwat had been conducting its own investigation following the allegations made by the employee of Severn Trent Water.
Ofwat began its investigation into the allegations in January 2005.
The matter reported to the SFO concerned data on leakage.
On 7 March 2006 Ofwat published its interim report concerning the allegations of false reporting made against Severn Trent Water in 2004.
The Companys internal investigation and Ofwats investigation were thorough and lengthy, requiring complex judgements.
Severn Trents judgements have not been identical to Ofwats in every aspect, but in the interests of making amends as soon as possible, the board believed it was sensible to proceed by agreement.
Having considered Ofwats findings, the board of Severn Trent Plc agreed that customer accounts should be credited as soon as possible.
In 2006 07, on average, this credit will be around 4 per customer in addition to the 2 to 3 already rebated.
In the following three years the rebate will be 2 to 3 per customer.
A provision of 10.6 million has been included in these financial statements in respect of amounts relating to 2005 06 and prior.
The Company also acknowledged that Ofwat may expect further amends to be made to customers.
Ofwat has stated that this penalty will be discussed with Severn Trent Water on completion of the SFO investigation into leakage.
On 7 April 2006 the Company announced that as a result of an ongoing comprehensive review of Severn Trent Water by its managing director, Tony Wray, and his new management team, the board believed there was prima facia evidence of customer relations data being misstated by Severn Trent Water in submissions to Ofwat.
The data concerned the handling of customer billing queries and telephone contacts over several years.
Ofwat is carrying out an independent verication of the internal Severn Trent investigation and report relating to customer relations data submitted to it using forensic accountants who will report to both Severn Trent Water and Ofwat on their conclusions.
No reliable estimate can currently be made of the amounts that might become payable as a result of the SFO enquiry, Ofwats final conclusion in respect of the allegations of false reporting or its review of customer relations data.
Consequently, except as noted above, no provision has been included in these financial statements in respect of these matters.
c Belgian environmental tax In June 2005 The Flemish Waste Agency OVAM instigated an investigation by the Antwerp Examining Magistrate into Biffa Belgiums waste recycling operations in connection with the payment of environmental taxes.
A provision of 4.0 million, the amount currently assessed by OVAM, has been made in these financial statements for potential additional environmental taxes, related penalties and interest for prior periods.
No provision has been made for any criminal penalties that might result from this investigation since no reliable estimate can be made of the amount that might become payable.
d Disposal of subsidiaries The group has entered into agreements to dispose of its interests in Worksuite LLC, the assets and certain liabilities of its CIS business and Biffa Belgium.
The group has given certain guarantees and indemnities to the purchasers of these businesses.
The group is not aware of any liability that is likely to result from these guarantees and indemnities that has not been provided for in these financial statements.

Further details of this are shown in note 12.
On 4 April 2006 the board of Severn Trent Plc announced that it intends to demerge its UK integrated waste management business, Biffa.
The board believes that the creation of two separately listed companies, Severn Trent Plc and Biffa Plc, each with dedicated boards and experienced management teams focused on continued strategic and operational development with access to their own capital will deliver greater benets to shareholders, customers and employees.
Following the demerger Severn Trent is expected to remain the UKs second largest listed water company and a constituent of the FTSE 100, continuing to focus on delivering investment programmes, improving efficiencies and customer service levels.
Biffa is one of the UKs leading integrated waste management companies.
It was acquired by Severn Trent in 1991 and since then it has grown both organically and through the acquisitions of UK Waste and Hales.
Following the demerger it is expected to be a constituent of the FTSE 250.
The decision to demerge Biffa remains subject to shareholder and other approvals and to further detailed due diligence.
The Board expects the demerger to be completed by the end of October 2006.
On 12 May 2006 the group agreed to sell Biffa Belgium to Veolia for 45 million.
The transaction is conditional upon the clearance form the Belgian competition authorities.
The sale is expected to complete in July 2006.
The financial effect of these cannot currently be determined.

The key areas of difference are: Property, plant and equipment Under UK GAAP, the water and wastewater infrastructure assets within Severn Trent Water were accounted for in accordance with the renewals accounting provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets.
Such provisions are not present within International Accounting Standard 16 Property, plant and equipment IAS 16 and it is therefore necessary to change the accounting policies for these assets on transition to IFRS.
The accounting policies applied under UK GAAP in respect of all other xed assets are compliant with IFRS and remain appropriate.
Under renewals accounting the water and wastewater infrastructure networks are assumed to be single assets.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancements to the networks and on maintaining the operating capability of the networks in accordance with dened standards of service are capitalised.
The depreciation charged is the estimated anticipated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the networks.
Grants and contributions relating to the maintenance of the operating capability of the infrastructure network were taken into account in determining this charge.
Grants and contributions relating to enhancement of the infrastructure network are deducted from the cost of xed assets.
Under IAS 16 this treatment may not be applied.
Therefore, the significant parts within the infrastructure networks have been identied and useful lives and residual values determined so that each significant part may be depreciated individually.
As the UK GAAP net book value of the infrastructure networks was determined using an accounting policy not compliant with IFRS, a deemed cost has been established for the opening balance sheet carrying value of the infrastructure networks by reference to the fair value at the date of transition, 1 April 2004 as permitted by IFRS 1.
The election to record the carrying value of the water and wastewater infrastructure networks at fair value, and to use that fair value as the deemed cost in the opening IFRS balance sheet, increases net assets by 275.5 million as at 31 March 2005 compared with UK GAAP.
The segments recognised within the water and wastewater networks have been based upon asset class since no single pipe or section of sewer is significant compared with the total value of the networks.
This has led to the identication of 6 segments impounding reservoirs, raw water aqueducts, large water mains, other water mains and pipes, strategic sewers and other sewers which have been assigned zero residual values at the end of their useful lives.
The lives allocated to these segments range from 80 250 years.
The depreciation on these assets results in an additional charge of 19.8 million in the 2005 IFRS income statement compared with UK GAAP.
Since the classication of expenditure incurred in maintaining the networks between operating expenditure and capital expenditure has not changed there is no change to the repairs and maintenance expenditure charged to the income statement over the long term.
However, under UK GAAP such expenditure was included in the calculation of the infrastructure renewals charge and was therefore smoothed over an Asset Management Period AMP.
Under IAS 16, repairs and maintenance expenditure will be charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
This will introduce an element of volatility into the income statement since the level of such expenditure can uctuate signicantly from one reporting period to the next, within a single AMP.
All grants and contributions are credited to deferred income and released to the income statement over the useful economic lives of the related assets.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 99 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued Retirement benets The group prepared its 2005 UK GAAP results in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24.
Under SSAP 24, any pension scheme surplus or deficit identied at the most recent actuarial valuation is recognised through the profit and loss account over the average expected remaining service lives of current employees.
The net pension cost under SSAP 24 therefore includes both the cost of providing an additional year of pension benets to employees regular cost and an element of the surplus or deficit relating to previous years variation.
The difference between employers contributions paid and the SSAP 24 net pension cost is recognised as a prepayment or accrual, which does not necessarily reect the actuarial position.
Interest is calculated on this balance sheet entry and is included in the net pension cost.
Under International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benets IAS 19, dened benefit scheme assets and liabilities have been valued at each balance sheet date and the resulting asset or liability is immediately recognised on the balance sheet.
At the start of each year, assumptions are made to enable the current service cost, the expected return on assets and the interest cost to be calculated.
These amounts are charged to the income statement for the year.
Where actual experience differs from the assumptions made at the start of a financial year, actuarial gains and losses are recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The expected return on assets and the interest on the liabilities are recognised within finance costs under IAS 19.
Under SSAP 24 all pension costs are recognised within operating profits.
The adoption of International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benets IAS19 increases the 2005 profit before tax by 18.1 million compared with UK GAAP, representing increased operating profits of 19.4 million and increased finance costs of 1.3 million.
Actuarial gains amounting to 43.2 million have been recognised in reserves.
At 31 March 2005, the derecognition of the UK GAAP SSAP 24 liability increases net assets by 5.6 million.
Net assets are then reduced by the recognition of the IAS 19 deficit of 317.5 million.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised under IFRS, but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
The reviews carried out at the transition date and 31 March 2005 indicated that no impairment had arisen.
Since goodwill is no longer being amortised, the 2005 amortisation charge of 30.1 million is eliminated.
Restructuring costs and termination of operations for 2005 are reduced by 9.9 million.
IFRS does not allow the UK GAAP requirement to charge goodwill previously written off directly to reserves as part of the loss on termination.
Deferred tax The most significant impact of International Accounting Standard Income Taxes IAS 12 for the group is that IAS 12 does not permit deferred tax balances to be discounted whereas Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Tax FRS 19 permits, but does not require, discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The groups policy has been to apply discounting to its deferred tax liability.
This is of particular signicance to a utility business where any reversal of timing differences is likely to be deferred long into the future due to the long asset lives of network assets.
The impact of eliminating discounting from the accounting for deferred tax is to increase the deferred tax charge in the year ended 31 March 2005 by 0.8 million and to increase the deferred tax liability at that date by 396.6 million.
IAS 12 takes a different conceptual approach to deferred tax than that applied by FRS 19.
Under IAS 12 deferred tax must be provided for on all temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base whereas UK GAAP requires deferred tax to be provided for on timing differences between the treatment of items in the tax computation and the income statement.
This change in approach results in deferred tax provisions under IFRS for items which under UK GAAP would be permanent differences and hence would not be provided for.
The impact on the groups IFRS financial statements is to decrease the deferred tax charge in the year ended 31 March 2005 by 0.2 million and to increase the deferred tax liability at that date by 20.4 million.
The other IFRS adjustments result in a deferred tax credit of 3.1 million in the year ended 31 March 2005 and a decrease in the deferred tax liability at that date of 14.2 million.
Dividends payable Under International Accounting Standard 10 Events after the Balance Sheet date dividends payable are not recognised as liabilities until they have been appropriately authorised and are unconditional obligations of the group.
Historically, under UK GAAP dividends declared for a particular period have been recognised in that periods financial statements, irrespective of the date that they are declared or approved by shareholders.
In practice this means that interim dividends will now be recognised in the second half of the financial year and final dividends will be recognised in the first half of the following year.
The impact on the groups IFRS financial statements is to reduce the amount of dividends appropriated in the year ended 31 March 2005 by 3.7 million and to increase net assets at 31 March 2005 by 104.6 million.
100 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Group financial statements Other differences The other main adjustments are: The impact of fair valuing shares awarded under LTIP schemes that had not vested before 1 April 2004 and share options granted under the groups SAYE schemes after 7 November 2002 in accordance with IFRS 2: and A change in the classication of the buildings element of certain property leases from operating to finance leases arising from the requirement in International Accounting Standard 17 Leases IAS 17 to consider the land and buildings elements of such leases separately: The impact of these adjustments on profit before tax and net assets, both individually and in aggregate, is not considered to be material although the impact of IFRS 2 will increase going forward as more SAYE options fall within its scope.
Financial instruments IFRS 1 permits the group to continue to apply UK GAAP in respect of financial instruments for the year ended 31 March 2005 and to apply IAS 32 and 39 with effect from 1 April 2005.
The comparative information for 2004 05 within these financial statements therefore reects financial instruments accounted for under the groups UK GAAP accounting policies.
The significant transition adjustments required to implement IAS 32 and 39 on 1 April 2005 are described below.
The most significant impact of IAS 39 is in relation to financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, that are held to hedge the groups exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Under UK GAAP, debt is initially recorded at the net proceeds of issue.
In subsequent periods this is adjusted for accrued finance costs and payments made.
The fair values of derivatives are not recognised in the balance sheet hence the balance sheet values and charges in the profit and loss account are relatively stable.
Under IAS 39, the default treatment is for debt to be carried at amortised cost, whilst derivatives are recognised separately on the balance sheet at fair value with movements in those fair values reected through the income statement.
This has the potential to introduce considerable volatility both to the income statement and to the balance sheet.
Therefore, for fair value hedges, IAS 39 allows changes in the recognised value of hedged debt that are attributable to the hedged risk to be adjusted through the income statement.
In the case of cash ow hedges, movements in the fair value of derivatives are deferred within reserves until they can be recycled through the income statement to offset the future income statement effect of changes in the hedged risk.
However, in order to apply this treatment, it must be demonstrated that the derivative has been, and will continue to be, an effective hedge of the hedged risk in the underlying debt within the strict criteria set out in IAS 39.
Any hedge ineffectiveness, provided it is within the range deemed acceptable by IAS 39, is recognised immediately within the income statement.
At 1 April 2005, the group held interest rate swaps as hedges against its exposure to interest rate uctuations for periods up to 2030.
The swap portfolio is designed to hedge the debt portfolio and provide an overall effective economic hedge.
However, these swaps are not individually designated to particular liabilities and so do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
As a result of applying IAS 39 at 1 April 2005 net assets were reduced by 57.8 million.
Explanation of material adjustments to the cash ow statement for 2005 Cash ows under IFRS include these in respect of cash equivalents.
An adjustment was therefore made to include cash ows in respect of cash held on deposit.
Cash ows arising from taxes on income were reclassied as cash ows from operating activities as it was not possible to identify elements associated with nancing and investment activities.
Cash ows arising from interest payments were reclassied as cash ows from operating activities on the basis that they enter into the determination of profit.
