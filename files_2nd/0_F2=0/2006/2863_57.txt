The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of 77.8m of which an IFRS transitional adjustment of 67.7m was taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2004.
