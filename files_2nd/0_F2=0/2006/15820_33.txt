Pensions The Company operates a number of funded defined benefit pension plans in the UK that provide benefits based upon final pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The plan assets are held separately from the Companys assets in funds that are under the control of trustees.
Day-to-day management of the plan assets is carried out by independent investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in the Company.
Certain employees and former employees whose pension benefits exceed the maximum that may be provided from the Companys defined benefit pension plans are entitled to an additional unfunded pension payable directly by the Company after their retirement.
The defined benefit pension plans operated by the Company are closed to new entrants.
Full actuarial valuations of the plans are carried out at least every three years.
The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2004.

Background The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Companys senior executives and other eligible employees.
Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
The information provided below relates only to options and awards that were granted to persons who are employees of the Company.
Share options Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Companys executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for the purposes of new grants in May 2005.
Options will however continue to be granted from time to time under the Companys savings-related share option scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the UK.
In 2006, the compensation expense recognised in respect of share options was 0.9 million 2005: 1.4 million.
Changes in the total number of share options outstanding to employees of the Company during the period were as follows: Year ended 30 December 2006 Year ended 31 December 2005 Weighted Weighted average average Options exercise price Options exercise price number pence number pence Outstanding at the beginning of the period 13,463,642 235.36 13,800,056 235.87 Granted during the period 37,898 269.40 32,983 218.40 Forfeited during the period 70,770 224.62 82,897 154.58 Exercised during the period 2,721,900 204.88 155,777 242.00 Expired during the period 130,723 327.83 Outstanding at the end of the period 10,708,870 243.30 13,463,642 235.36 Exercisable at the end of the period 8,748,598 242.75 5,076,142 250.30 On the dates on which options were exercised during 2006, the weighted average market price of the Companys ordinary shares was 334.74p per share 2005: 275.85p per share.
The compensation expense recognised in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted to the Companys employees during the period were as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 December 31 December 2006 2005 Options granted 37,898 32,983 Weighted average fair value 106.52p 87.24p Weighted average assumptions: Share price 336.75p 273.00p Exercise price 269.40p 218.40p Expected volatility 28.94% 30.46% Expected life 4.52 years 5.25 years Risk-free interest rate 4.50% 3.84% Expected dividends 13.00p 12.60p Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the shorter of the expected life of the options and the period since the beginning of the Companys financial year ended 30 April 2002 when, following a period of significant demerger activity, the Group was refocused on its remaining core businesses.
Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Share-based incentives continued The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding to the Companys employees at the end of the period was as follows: As at 30 December 2006 As at 31 December 2005 Weighted Weighted average average remaining remaining Outstanding contractual life Outstanding contractual life number years number years Range of exercise prices 150p to 200p 3,088,072 5.12 4,569,914 6.00 201p to 250p 3,419,950 6.86 4,730,778 7.26 251p to 300p 3,185,620 6.04 3,147,722 7.06 301p and higher 1,015,228 5.12 1,015,228 6.12 10,708,870 13,463,642 C. Other awards The Companys principal ongoing share-based compensation arrangements are the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan ABIP and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Both are restricted to the Companys senior executives.
ABIP provides an award of bonus shares and deferred shares based on the profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.
Bonus shares are restricted and vest after a period of three years.
Dividends are paid on the bonus shares.
Deferred shares vest after a period of three years conditional on the participants continued employment with the Group.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares until they have vested.
During 2006, awards were granted over 373,092 ordinary shares 2005: 349,598 ordinary shares under the ABIP.
PSP, which was introduced during 2006, provides awards of shares which vest after a period of three years conditional on the Groups total shareholder return relative to its cost of equity over the vesting period and the participants continued employment with the Group.
During 2006, awards were granted over 3,056,804 ordinary shares under the PSP.
From time to time, matching awards are also made under the Share Matching Scheme SMS which is a legacy scheme that is closed to new entrants.
During 2006, there were no awards under the SMS, but during 2005 matching awards were made over 11,320 ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards made under the ABIP and the SMS is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made under these schemes during the period was 271.97p 2005: 257.86p.
The fair value of awards made under the PSP is measured using the Monte-Carlo valuation model.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted under the PSP were as follows: Year ended 30 December 2006 Weighted average fair value 91.79p Weighted average assumptions: Expected volatility 23.05% Expected life 2.73 years Risk-free interest rate 4.77% Dividend yield 4.80% Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the awards.
In 2006, the compensation expense recognised in respect of other awards was 1.5 million 2005: 1.4 million.
In 2005, the compensation expense included 0.6 million in respect of the Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan which was a plan introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol was entitled to elect to receive a cash payment in lieu of shares and for this reason the award to him under this plan was classified as a cash-settled transaction.
In the event, Mr Nicol elected to receive cash and the Companys obligation under the plan was settled on 28 February 2005.

Deferred tax During 2005, it became no longer appropriate for the Company to recognise deferred tax assets because their future economic benefit had become uncertain due to the extent of forecast tax losses available for surrender within the UK tax group to which the Company belongs.
Deferred tax assets will be recognised when it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
