The calculations include a number of judgements and estimations in respect of the expected rate of return on assets, the discount rate, ination assumptions, the rate of increase in salaries, and life expectancy amongst others.
Changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the value of the retirement benefit obligation.
In order to substantially reduce the volatility in the underlying investment performance and reduce the risk of a significant increase in the obligation, a new investment policy in respect of the assets of the WH Smith Pension Trust was adopted on 22 September 2005.

53 Smiths News PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to Accounts 4 Retirement benefit obligation The Group has operated a number of dened benefit and dened contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a dened benefit scheme WH Smith Pension Trust Pension Trust, and a dened contribution scheme, WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant is the Pension Trust for the Groups UK employees which is described in Note 4 a i.
The scheme is independent of the Company and is administered by a Trustee.
The Trustee of the Pension Trust has extensive powers over the pension plans arrangements, including the ability to determine the levels of contribution.
Segregation of assets and liabilities of each pension scheme into two sections On the date of demerger, the assets and liabilities of the dened benefit scheme have been split between the News business, owned by Smiths News PLC and the WH Smith Retail business owned by WH Smith PLC by way of a sectionalisation of the dened benefit scheme into two different sections i. e. the News business section and the WH Smith Retail business section.
The two sections will remain within the dened benefit scheme.
Similarly, the assets and liabilities of the dened contribution scheme will be separated or sectionalised into two different sections, a News business section and a WH Smith Retail business section, with each section only containing the accounts of members who are or were employed by the relevant business.
The two sections will remain within the WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan.
The demerged WH Smith Retail business section has been disclosed within discontinued operations within the income statement.
Upon sectionalisation of the Pension Trust, the assets and liabilities of the dened benefit scheme will be allocated to the News business section and the WH Smith Retail business section in proportions that reected the liabilities of active, deferred, pensioner and orphan members belonging to the respective businesses.
Orphan members are members or spouses of members whose employer had left the Group prior to the split but were classied as either News or Retail for the purpose of the sectionalisation.
The proportions are currently expected to be 35 per cent, for the News business and 65 per cent, for the WH Smith Retail business.
The participating employers of the News business will contribute to the News business section, and the participating employers of the WH Smith Retail business will contribute to the WH Smith Retail business section.
Assets apportioned to one section of the Pension Trust will not be able to be used for the purposes of the other section.
There will be no cross-subsidy or cross-guarantee between the sections of the Pension Trust.
However, for administrative and investment purposes the Pension Trust will operate generally on a unied basis, except that the principal employer will be replaced with a sponsor for each section.
On 1 September 2006, a one-off contribution of 25m was made to the Pension Trust by the Company.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities in relation to these plans are as follows: m 2006 2005 Present value of the obligations 334 967 Fair value of plan assets 285 871 deficit 49 96 Retirement medical benefit liability 7 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 49 103 Deferred taxation see Note 20 15 30 Net retirement obligation 34 73 54 Smiths News PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to Accounts 4 Retirement benefit obligation a Dened benefit pension scheme i The WH Smith Pension Trust Pension Trust A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting, using the projected unit basis, and, as with each such triennial valuation, the valuation currently remains subject to the formal approval of the Pension Trust Trustee.
The scheme was closed in September 1995 and under the projected unit method the current service cost would be projected to increase as members approach retirement and the age prole of members increases.
On an ongoing basis, the actuarial gross dened benefit pension deficit was approximately 63m approximately 44m net of related deferred taxes for the Smiths News PLCs section of the WH Smith Pension Trust.
The ongoing deficit is greater than the IAS19 deficit primarily due to the different assumptions and calculation methodologies.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a new investment policy in order to reduce substantially the volatility in the underlying investment performance and reduce the risk of a significant increase in the deficit in the fund.
The assets in the investment fund were restructured in order to adopt this policy.
This involved the assets being invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and ination a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy.
The key features of the new investment policy were that: 94 per cent of the Pension Trusts assets was invested in an LDI policy with a leading international institutional fund manager: and 6 per cent of the Pension Trusts assets was used to purchase a portfolio of long-dated equity call options.
These represented a notional exposure to underlying equities of some 350m.
The impact of this change in investment policy is to reduce substantially the volatility in the fund and the resultant risk of a significant increase in the overall deficit whilst enabling the fund to continue to benefit from any potential higher returns in the equity markets.
The valuation of the dened benefit pension scheme used for the account disclosures are based upon the most recent valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date.

Prior to 22 September 2005, the overall expected rate of return on the Trusts assets was calculated as a weighted average return based on the distribution of the assets between equities, bonds and cash, at the accounting date.
On 22 September 2005, the investment strategy was altered to invest in a Liability Driven Investment LDI fund and a number of equity call options.
The mortality assumptions in years underlying the value of the accrued liabilities are: Male Female Life expectancy at age 65 Member currently aged 65 20.1 22.9 Member currently aged 45 21.4 24.1 Life expectancy at age 60 Member currently aged 60 24.9 27.7 Member currently aged 45 25.9 28.7 The mortality assumptions are based on the standard PA92 medium cohort tables as published by the Institute of Actuaries.

In September 2005, the members were offered the option to be bought out of this scheme, which was accepted by the majority of the members.
The impact of the settlement was a 5m reduction in the net deficit and this has been disclosed within discontinued operations.
A small number of members opted to remain in the scheme and the present value of the remaining future liabilities relating to Smiths News PLC is valued at 0.1m net of deferred taxation.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods at 31 August 2006: nil 31 August 2005: 1m which relates to the Retailing Business which has subsequently been disposed.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with acceptable credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Floating rate debt comprises 50m of unsecured term loan bearing an interest rate of six month LIBOR plus 75 basis points.
5m is repayable on each of the second, third and fourth anniversary of the date of the agreement and the balance of 35m is repayable on the fifth anniversary of the date of the agreement.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group nances its operations through a mixture of share capital, retained profits, trade credit and bank borrowings and currently holds surplus cash.
It is and has been throughout the year and prior year, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk and market price risk.
68 Smiths News PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to Accounts 21 Analysis of net debt continued Liquidity risks: On 26 June 2006, the Group entered a five year 100m facility agreement with Alliance and Leicester Commercial Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc comprising a 50m term loan facility, of which amounts repaid may not be reborrowed, and a 50m multicurrency revolving credit facility.
At 31 August 2006, the Group has drawn down 50m of the term loan facility.
On 1 September 2006, 20m was drawn down from the available committed facilities which are due to expire in June 2011.
On demerger, 31 August 2006, the three year syndicated borrowing facilities which were held as at August 2005 comprised a 65m unsecured term loan facility all of which was repaid during the year and a 150m working capital revolving credit facility were cancelled.
Market price risk: The Groups exposure to market price risk comprises interest rate risk.
It regularly monitors this exposure and considers from time to time whether there would be a benefit in further hedging this risk.
The Group avoids the use of derivatives or other financial instruments in circumstances when the outcome would effectively be largely dependent upon speculation on future rate movements.
As a result of monitoring the interest rate risk exposure, on 1 September 2006, the Group entered into an interest rate swap to hedge part of its exposure to unfavourable movements in interest rates.
At 1 September 2006, oating rate debt comprises 12m of unsecured term loan bearing an interest rate of six month LIBOR plus 75 basis points and xed rate debt comprises 38m of unsecured term loan bearing an interest rate of 5.13 per cent.
22 Contingent liabilities and capital commitments m 2006 2005 Bank and other loans guaranteed 2 11 2 11 Other potential liabilities that could crystallise are in respect of previous assignments of leases where the liability could revert to the Group if the lessee defaulted.
Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement, any such contingent liability which becomes an actual liability will be apportioned between Smiths News PLC and WH Smith PLC in the ratio 35:65 provided that the actual liability of the Smiths News PLC in any 12 month period does not exceed 5m.
The Companys share of these leases have an estimated future cumulative gross rental commitment at 31 August 2006 of 55m 2005: 181m.

The financial instruments used by the discontinued businesses to manage its currency risks were forward rate contracts and currency options.
For the year ended 31 August 2006, the discontinued businesses entered into a number of forward currency derivatives contracts to manage their foreign exchange exposures arising from Far East stock purchases.
Upon demerger, at 31 August 2006, these contracts have been discontinued.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are nil.
The movement in derivative assets recognised on the balance sheet over the financial year is shown below: m Balance at 31 August 2005 Adoption of IAS 39 1 Balance at 1 September 2005 1 Movement 2 Subsidiaries disposed 1 Balance at 31 August 2006 Interest rate swaps The Groups exposure to market price risk comprises interest rate risk.
The Group avoids the use of derivatives or other financial instruments in circumstances when the outcome would effectively be largely dependent upon speculation of future rate movements.
There were no interest rate swaps as at the year ended 31 August 2006.
Comparative information as at 31 August 2005 The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 from the requirement to restate comparatives in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The relevant comparative gures have therefore been measured and presented in accordance with previously adopted UK GAAP.
In the prior year, the Groups financial instruments were accounted for under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments and comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors, trade creditors etc that arise directly from its operations.
In addition the Group had significant property operating leases.
The Group was required to state under FRS 13 that it has applied an exemption available under FRS 13 from making disclosures of short term debtors and creditors.
Options were granted at a 20 per cent discount to the market price of the shares on the day preceding the date of offer and are normally exercisable for a period of six months after completion of the SAYE contract.
As a result of the demerger, all outstanding options under the WH Smith Sharesave Scheme 1999 became exercisable.
Since 1995, the exercise of options has been conditional on the achievement of a performance target, which was determined by the Board at the time of grant.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration Report.
As a result of the demerger, all outstanding options under the WH Smith Group Executive Option Scheme and the approved part of the WH Smith Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 became exercisable.
All outstanding options under the unapproved part of the current WH Smith Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 will be exchanged for new options over the Companys shares.
These awards will only vest and become exercisable if underlying performance targets are met.
Outstanding awards granted under the WH Smith 2004 Management Investment Plan are as follows: Number of shares Exercise Date of grant 2006 2005 price pence Exercise period 3 November 2004 275,905 2,620,431 Nil 01.02.08 31.01.10 26 November 2004 9,604 9,604 Nil 01.02.08 31.01.10 24 February 2005 155,844 Nil 01.02.08 31.01.10 26 April 2005 412,179 Nil 01.02.08 31.01.10 3 June 2005 24,954 Nil 01.02.08 31.01.10 285,509 3,223,012 To the extent that awards vest, 75 per cent will be exercisable immediately following the vesting date 31 January 2008 and 25 per cent will be exercisable one year later.
