The impairment recognised for the year was 35.1 million 2005 2.7 million.
Of the impairment for the year, 15.4 million relates to the exhibition division following a downturn in the consumer and gift markets it serves and 19.2 million relating to the national newspapers division.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all the Groups cash-generating units CGUs are measured at their value in use by discounting future expected cash flows.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on management approved budgets and forecasts in the case of businesses acquired in the year, the cash flow projections are consistent with the business acquisition plans.
Cash flows beyond the initial five-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate.
The cash flows are discounted at the Groups weighted current cost of capital adjusted for the particular risks associated with each CGU.
These assumptions have been used for all CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the Groups products in new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations.
Each year, the Group reviews the appropriateness of its intangible assets.
The Group tests intangible fixed assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that intangible fixed assets might be impaired.
The impairment recognised for the year was 24.1 million 2005 2.6 million.
Of the impairment for the year, 22.4 million relates to write down of radio licences following a softening of the markets they serve, 1.0 million relating to the national newspapers division and 0.8 million relating to the exhibitions division following a downturn in the consumer and gift markets they serve.
The Group is satisfied that the carrying value at 1st October, 2006 remains recoverable in full.

Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by the Group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and forward foreign exchange contracts set out below represent the replacement costs calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 1st October, 2006.
The fair value of long-term borrowings has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc 97 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET Continued 30 Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to changes in interest rates.
The following sensitivity analysis of borrowings and derivative financial instruments to interest rate movements assumes an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates for all currencies and maturities from their levels at 1st October, 2006, with all other variables held constant.
The range of changes represents the Groups view of the changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period based on these assumptions.
At 1st October, 2006, the majority of net borrowings are either fixed rate or have been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net interest expense of 1.2 million, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and other long-term borrowings at 1st October, 2006.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net interest expense of 1.2 million.
The sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments at 1st October, 2006 to changes in interest rates is set out in the table below.

Long-term borrowings comprise bank loans, bonds, finance lease and deferred consideration.
Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than those of each of the parent companies, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
The following sensitivity analysis of net borrowings and derivative financial instruments to foreign exchange rate movements assumes an immediate 10% change in all foreign exchange rates against sterling as appropriate from their levels at 1st October, 2006, with all other variables held constant.
A 10% change indicates a strengthening of the currency against sterling and a -10% change indicates a weakening of the currency against sterling.

The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them.
The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AAA by Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be as follows: 2006 2005 m m Expiring in one year or less Bank deposits 97.3 81.7 Money market fund investments 42.5 Derivative financial instruments 39.3 4.0 136.6 128.2 Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS 39 Financial Instruments, effective from 3rd October, 2005 are described below: Fair value hedges The Groups policy is to use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives with a principal amount of 75.0 million were in place at 1st October, 2006 swapping fixed rate term sterling debt issues to floating rate sterling.
All fair value hedges were effective throughout the year ended 1st October, 2006.
The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges included in the income statement for the year ended 1st October, 2006 were: Fair value 2nd October movement Exchange 1st October 2005 gain loss gain loss 2006 m m m m Sterling interest rate swaps 2.3 2.3 Sterling debt 2.3 2.3 Total Cash flow hedges The group enters into two types of cash flow hedge: fixed to fixed cross currency interest rate swaps and forward currency sales purchases which hedge tax payable receivable when long-term intercompany non-trading balances are revalued and foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future currency expenditure.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 1st October, 2006.
The deferred gain on cash flow hedges at 1st October, 2006 amounted to 0.1 million and is expected to be recognised in the income statement in the year ending 30th September, 2007.
Net investment hedges The Group enters into net investment hedge to hedge the Groups investment in foreign operations.

The schemes for most employees are funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, based on final pensionable salary.
In addition, a number of defined contribution pension plans are operated by certain divisions of the Group where this type of pension provision aligns with the business model.
The assets of all the schemes are held independently from the Groups finances and in the UK are administered by trustees or trustee companies.
Since the last year-end, and in the light of very recent case law, legal advice received is that the DMGT AVC Plan, a plan established to enable members of the main defined benefit schemes of the Group to make additional voluntary contributions AVCs to enhance their pension benefits, should be categorised as a defined benefit arrangement.
It has therefore been included in the pension disclosures for the first time.
The inclusion of this Plan has increased the defined benefit obligation to the Group by 62.1 million as at 1st October, 2006 2005 63.2 million.
The assets of the Plan as at 1st October, 2006 were 65.7 million, producing a surplus of 3.6 million 2005 deficit 0.1million.
However, as indicated in the disclosures below, an adjustment has been made for 2006 to cap the value of assets in the Plan since the surplus is not recoverable by the Group.
Thus, the net value of the Plan in the Group balance sheet is zero.
These adjustments are reflected in the reconciliation of the Groups overall pension assets and liabilities, and in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
The inclusion of the Plan has had no impact on the pension cost reported in these financial statements.
The total net pension costs of the Group for the year ended 1st October, 2006 were 34.4 million 2005 41.8 million.
Aberdeen Journals The sale by the Group of Aberdeen Journals Limited on 2nd April, 2006 crystallised from a pensions viewpoint on 30th September, 2006 following a period of continued participation by employees of that company in the Groups pension scheme.
The pension implications of this sale whereby an option has been given to employees to transfer their benefits to the purchasers pension arrangements has been taken into account in the figures below.
The sale triggers a payment to the defined benefit schemes to deal with the debt arising under Section 75 of the Pensions Act 2004.
The actual amount to be paid has yet to be finalised, but is expected to be in the region of 25.9 million.
Defined benefit schemes Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially by the actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The figures in this note are based on the calculations in connection with the valuation of the main schemes as at 31st March, 2004, and updated to 1st October, 2006 by the actuary.
The company cash contribution rate to the main schemes during the year was 18% of pensionable salaries 2005 18%.
The main schemes have a two-tiered benefit structure represented by a Standard section and a Pension section.
In the Standard section, employees pay contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries and have benefits based on a normal retirement age of 65.
Under the Pension section, employees currently pay contributions of 7%, rising to 7.5% on 1st July, 2007 and enjoy a higher benefit accrual rate and lower normal retirement age than in the Standard section.
The schemes remain open to eligible new employees who, after one years service, can join the Standard section with an option to join the Pension section after a further four years service.

Daily Mail and General Trust plc 102 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET Continued 31 Post-employment benefits continued The assumption for the expected overall rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class based on the proportion of assets held in each class at the beginning of the year.
The expected return on bonds has been selected having regard to gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
The expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of estimated risk premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields on bonds, and consensus economic forecasts for future returns.
The actual return on plan assets was 185.1 million 2005 255.2 million representing the expected return plus the associated actuarial gain or loss during the year.
The size of the pension deficit is sensitive to the assumptions adopted.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following table: 2006 2005 % % Price inflation 2.90 2.75 Salary increases 4.40 4.30 Pension increases 2.90 2.75 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.00 5.00 Expected overall rate of return on assets 6.90 7.20 The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
Based on the reported liabilities at 1st October, 2006, a movement of 0.1% in the discount rate would represent a change in the value of those liabilities of approximately 30.3 million before associated deferred tax.
The mortality assumptions adopted reflect the mortality experience of the schemes and a best estimate of future average life expectancies and are shown in the following table: 2006 Future life expectancy from age 60 years For a current 60 year old male member of the scheme 23 For a current 60 year old female member of the scheme 26.5 For a current 50 year old male member of the scheme 24.5 For a current 50 year old female member of the scheme 28 The above mortality assumptions will be reviewed again as part of the next formal valuation of the principal schemes as at 31st March, 2007.
At the same time an adjustment to reflect the extent to which retiring employees commute part of their pension for cash will be considered.
As no allowance is currently made for commutation, such adjustment would serve to offset to some extent any increase in liabilities next year if it is agreed that stronger mortality assumptions are justified.
The amounts charged to the income statement based on the above assumptions are shown in the following table: 2006 2005 m m Service cost 50.0 48.6 Interest cost 85.9 81.5 Expected return on assets 106.1 91.4 Past service cost 2.9 0.6 Settlements curtailments 5.9 Net charge to income statement 26.8 39.3 Amounts recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE are shown in the following table: 2006 2005 m m Actuarial gain recognised in SORIE 38.2 19.5 Inclusion of BUP Executive Pension Scheme 4.3 Impact of asset ceiling on AVC Plan 3.6 Total gains recognised in SORIE 34.6 15.2 Cumulative actuarial gain recognised in SORIE at beginning of year 15.2 Cumulative actuarial gain recognised in SORIE at end of year 49.8 15.2 Daily Mail and General Trust plc 103 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET Continued 31 Post-employment benefits continued The Group expects to contribute approximately 52.8 million to the schemes during the 2007 financial year, including 25.9 million which relates to the section 75 debt arising from the sale of Aberdeen Journals Limited.
Included in scheme assets is an advance payment into the Groups pension schemes amounting to 23.6 million in respect of the 2007 contributions 2005 32.3 million.
A special funding payment of 2.5 million was made prior to the year-end relating to a commitment given by the Group when agreeing the terms of merger of two of its schemes with effect from 30th September, 2005.
UK Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
These are principally trust-based arrangements currently, with an aggregate value of 26.0 million at the year end.
Recent acquisitions of businesses outside the newspaper divisions mean that a higher portion of the Groups employees will be offered defined contribution arrangements in future.
The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounted to 5.2 million 2005 6.0 million.
Overseas pension plans Overseas subsidiaries of certain Group divisions operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in North America and Australia.
The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to 2.4 million 2005 1.8 million.
Pension arrangements for executives The Group operates a two-tier, defined benefit pension scheme for senior executives including executive Directors, details of which are incorporated in the above disclosures.
On 1st April, 2005, this became a contributory scheme.
It is the Groups policy that annual bonuses, payments under the Executive Bonus Scheme and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Included in UK Defined Contribution Plans above are investments in a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for certain executives of the Group including two executive Directors who were subject to the pensionable earnings cap imposed by HM Revenue and Customs under the previous tax regime.
The assets of this scheme are held under individual trusts independently from the Groups finances: investment during the year totalled 0.2 million 2005 1.1 million.
The Group has terminated its investment in this scheme with effect from 5th April, 2006, to coincide with the tax changes introduced from that date.
Stakeholder pension DMGT provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for the other pension schemes operated by the Group.

14.4 million of these assets will expire between 2017 and 2025.
The remaining assets have no expiry date.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 19.5 million 2005 16.4 million which relates primarily to overseas tax losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset relating to capital losses carried forward of 26.1 million 2005 49.2 million.

Under IFRS, only computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is included as property, plant and equipment.
All other computer software is included as an intangible asset.
As a result, certain software previously shown as fixed assets has been reclassified as intangible assets: Under UK GAAP, specific definitions exist for cash at bank and in hand and short-term investments.
Under IFRS, a new category, described as cash and cash equivalents, replaces the UK GAAP equivalent of cash at bank and in hand.
The definition of cash and cash equivalents results in a reclassification of certain amounts from short-term investments into cash and cash equivalents: Under UK GAAP, provisions for liabilities and charges are not required to be split formally between current and non-current.
IFRS requires this distinction to be made: Under UK GAAP, deferred tax assets are split between amounts falling due within one year and amounts falling due after more than one year.
IFRS requires all deferred tax asset balances to be shown as non-current: and Under UK GAAP, minority interests were disclosed separately on the face of the Group balance sheet.
