19 FAIR VALUE AND RISKS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The groups financial instruments are set out in note 20.
In the normal course of its operations, the group is exposed to commodity price, currency, interest, liquidity and credit risk.
In managing some of these risks, the group enters into derivative financial instruments.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at their fair value on the balance sheet.
19.1 Concentration of credit risk The groups derivative financial instruments and cash balances do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in Mali.
The gold produced is sold to a reputable gold refinery.
The group is not exposed to significant credit risk, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
Included in receivables is US$18.4 million net of a provision to reflect the time value of money 2005: US$20.0 million relating to indirect taxes owing to Morila and Loulo by the State of Mali, which are denominated in FCFA.
Receivables also include advances to a contractor totalling US$11.8 million net of a provision to reflect the time value of money 2005: US$12.2 million see note 24.
19.2 Foreign currency and commodity price risk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily Euro and Communaut Financire Africaine Franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into derivatives to manage these currency risks.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and sells at market spot prices.
Gold sales are disclosed in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
