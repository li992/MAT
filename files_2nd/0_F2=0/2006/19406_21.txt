notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2006 1. accounting policies i basis of preparation Quintain Estates and Development PLC is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the Group, and equity account the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Board in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Group financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs.
The principal exception is that, as more fully explained in note 20 below, financial instruments are accounted for on different bases in the current year and the comparative year owing to the transitional provisions of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires the Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosure, which has been adopted by the European Union and is available for early application, has not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
ii transition to adopted ifrss The Group has prepared its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRSs for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
An explanation of how the transition to Adopted IFRSs has affected the reported financial performance and financial position is provided in notes 2 and 3 below and in note 41 on pages 94 to 101.
IFRS 1 also requires an explanation of major adjustments to cash ows under IFRS.
However, while the format of the IFRS cash ow statement differs from that under UK GAAP, there are no material changes to cash ows from operations, investment or nancing, other than the inclusion of liquid resources within cash and cash equivalents note 41xxi.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted in IFRS 1 to set cumulative translation differences from foreign operations to nil from the commencement of the transition year.
iii measurement convention The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis except that investment and development properties and derivative financial instruments have been stated at fair value.
The measurement of fair value constitutes the main area of judgement exercised by the Board in respect of the Groups results.
In relation to the Groups investment and development properties, the Board has relied upon the external valuations carried out by professionally quali ed valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Copies of the valuation reports of Savills Commercial Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited, which together account for the valuation of 98.8% of these categories of non-current assets and of Christie Co, which values the investment properties within Quercus, currently the Groups principal joint venture, are contained on pages 44 and 45.
In respect of financial instruments, the Board has relied on the valuation carried out by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, financial risk consultants, and the basis for this exercise is discussed below in section xviii of this note and in note 21.
Other areas of judgement, risk and uncertainty which are relevant to an understanding of these results and the Groups financial position are referred to in the Operating and Financial Review.
iv basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has signi cant in uence but not control over financial and operating policies.
The Group equity accounts for its share of net pro t after tax of joint ventures and associates, together with its share of fair value adjustments to their investment properties, through the income statement.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash ow hedges within joint ventures less any related tax is recognised directly in equity.
All other changes are recognised in the income statement.
The Groups interest in the net assets of joint ventures and associates is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
62 quintain estates and development plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 march 2006 v foreign currency Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Operating income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates.
The year end and average rates used for these purposes were as follows: Year end Year end Average Average 2006 2005 2006 2005 France 1 1.44 1.46 1.47 1.47 United States 1 $1.74 $1.88 $1.79 $1.85 Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are re ected in the Translation reserve and released to the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
vi revenue and cost of sales Revenue is stated net of VAT and comprises rental income, proceeds from sales of trading properties, income from leisure operations, fees, commissions and other income.
Rental income from investment and development properties leased out under operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent rents such as turnover rents and indexed rents are recognised as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Lease incentives are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or the period to the first tenant break, if shorter.
Property operating costs are expensed as incurred including any element of service charge expenditure not recovered from tenants.
Sales of trading properties are recognised on the unconditional exchange of contracts by the balance sheet date.
vii disposal of properties held as non-current assets Sales of properties are recognised in the accounts if an unconditional contract is exchanged by the balance sheet date.
Pro ts or losses arising on disposal are calculated by reference to the carrying value of the asset at the beginning of the year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
viii impairment The Groups assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication becomes evident, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value-in-use.
The value-in-use is determined as the net present value of the future cash ows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset.
Any impairment of financial assets is based on the original effective interest rate attributable to the financial asset on acquisition.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
ix employee benefits Pensions Contributions to employees personal plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Share-based payment schemes The fair value of equity rights is estimated using the Black Scholes and binomial models at the date of grant to Directors and staff and is dependent on factors such as the exercise price, expected volatility, option price and risk free interest rate.
The fair value is then amortised through the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Expected volatility is determined based on the historic share price volatility market price for the Company on the grant date over a period matched to the expected life of the awards.
x capitalisation of borrowing costs Net borrowing costs in respect of capital expenditure on properties under development or undergoing refurbishment are capitalised.
Interest is capitalised using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing from the commencement of development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
quintain estates and development plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 march 2006 63 notes to the accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2006 1. accounting policies continued xi tax Tax is included in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences, except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
xii discontinued operations In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the loss from discontinued operations is shown in the income statement net of tax.
xiii investment properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held either for long term rental growth or for capital appreciation, or both.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost including related transaction costs and valued annually by professionally quali ed external valuers.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and in the case of investment properties under development, capitalised interest.
Investment properties are independently valued by external valuers at market value.
The valuations are prepared by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable from the properties and where relevant, associated costs.
A yield which re ects the speci c risks inherent in the net cash ows is then applied to the net annual rentals to arrive at the property valuation.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property remains an investment property and is not reclassi ed.
xiv development properties Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classi ed as development properties and stated at fair value in accordance with IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Changes in fair value are recognised through equity in the Revaluation reserve.
However, a fide cit on revaluation of a development property is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it exceeds any surplus held in the Revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that property.
Similarly, a surplus on revaluation is credited to the income statement to the extent of a fide cit previously charged.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a development property are capitalised.
When developments are completed, they are reclassi ed as investment properties and any accumulated balance on revaluation is transferred to Retained earnings.
Development properties which are independently valued annually by external professional valuers are stated at estimated market value on completion less estimated costs to complete.
xv leases The Group as lessor Leases are classi ed according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classi ed as a finance lease.
All other leases are classi ed as operating leases.
The Board has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17, Leases, for all properties leased to tenants and have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Accordingly, all the Groups leasehold properties are classi ed as investment or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
64 quintain estates and development plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 march 2006 The Group as lessee The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Payments to the Groups landlords are apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rent reviews are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
xvi owner-occupied properties, plant and equipment Fixtures, ttings and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful life of these assets estimated at between three to five years.
xvii trading properties Trading properties are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of trading properties is determined on the basis of speci c identi cation of their individual costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
xviii financial instruments Other non-current investments Other non-current investments are non-derivative investments that are designated as available for sale.
As these are unquoted investments, they are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at invoiced values less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the agreed terms of the receivables concerned.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand, deposits with banks and other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised at invoiced amount.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risk.
These derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently re-measured.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting in which case the effective element of the gain or loss is recognised directly through equity in a hedging reserve.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking account of current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The Groups interest rate swaps are shown in these accounts at fair value as derived by JC Rathbone Associates Limited, financial risk consultants, based on market prices, estimated future cash ows and forward rates as appropriate.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 not to restate corresponding amounts in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The corresponding amounts for the year ended 31 March 2005 are presented and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and FRS 4, Capital Instruments.
Property index-linked total return swap The Group enters into property derivatives to mitigate or enhance its exposure to a particular class or a spectrum of property assets.
Such instruments are accounted for initially in the balance sheet at fair value with subsequent re-measurement being re ected through the income statement.
The swap was valued as at the year end by JC Rathbone Associates Limited at market value.
xix own shares held by esop trusts Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trusts, the Quintain Group Employee Bene t Trust and the Quintain Estates and Development Deferred Bonus Plan Trust, are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

ii Under SIC 15, Operating Leases: Incentives, rent free periods are allocated over the whole lease term or the period to the first tenant break if shorter, rather than the period to the first rent review as is the case under UK GAAP.
iii Under IAS 40, Investment Property, certain operating leases can be deemed finance leases.
The liability under these leases is recognised as the present value of the minimum lease payments at the date of inception or acquisition of the lease.
Part of the rent payable under the lease is treated as a finance charge based on the discount rate used in this calculation.
iv Under IAS 31, Interest in Joint Ventures, the Group accounts for jointly administered arrangements as joint ventures.
As a result, interest capitalised under UK GAAP on the Groups share of the cost of development properties has been reversed.
The effect of this has been to reduce the cost of disposal in respect of units sold, giving rise to a net positive adjustment in the current year and a net negative one in the comparative year.
v Under IAS 40, changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised separately in the income statement.
vi As revaluation fide cits on investment properties are included in the income statement, these fide cits would also re ect any impairment charge previously recognised in property related costs under UK GAAP.
vii Under IAS 40, revaluation surpluses and fide cits on investment properties are recognised in the income statement, thus measuring the amortisation in the value of the Groups short leasehold investment properties.
viii Under IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, when the carrying amount of a development property is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease should be recognised as an expense.
However, a revaluation decrease is charged directly against any related revaluation surplus to the extent that the decrease does not exceed the amount held in the revaluation surplus in respect of the same asset.
For further details, see note 41.
3. reconciliation of equity reported under uk gaap to equity under ifrs As at As at 31 March 1 April 2005 2004 Notes 000 000 Equity shareholders funds under UK GAAP 638,261 523,513 IFRS adjustments: Obligations under finance leases i 12,750 18,776 Leasehold property interests i 12,750 18,776 Deferred tax on revaluation gains and other tax movements ii 75,453 58,249 Interest capitalised on jointly administered property iii 407 223 Exclusion of proposed dividend iv 8,700 7,757 Equity shareholders funds under IFRS 571,101 472,798 66 quintain estates and development plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 march 2006 notes: i Interests in leasehold properties are accounted for as finance leases under IAS 40, Investment Property, and the obligation to the lessor is included within non-current liabilities, calculated as the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
Investment and development properties are valued net of this obligation, so an amount equivalent to the obligation is included in the balance sheet as a non-current asset.
An element of the rent payable is treated as interest and a part repayment of the obligation to the lessor.
ii Under IAS 12, Income Taxes, a deferred tax provision is made for the tax that would potentially be payable on the sale of investment and development properties and other assets where the carrying value is different from their cost for tax purposes.
UK GAAP requires that this potential liability is disclosed in contingent tax but not provided for in the balance sheet.
iii Under IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, jointly administered arrangements are accounted for as joint ventures.
Accordingly, interest previously capitalised on development expenditure under the proportional basis of accounting adopted under UK GAAP has been reversed.
iv Under IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, unapproved dividends are not provided for.
Under UK GAAP prevailing as at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005, proposed dividends were shown as a liability in the balance sheet.

These loan facilities were terminated following their replacement by a new 475 million Syndicated facility.
Of the interest capitalised in the year, the amount capitalised to development properties was 7,506,000 2005: 4,060,000, investment properties 318,000 2005: nil and trading properties nil 2005: 635,000.
Cumulative capitalised interest included within trading properties as at 31 March 2006 was nil 2005: 434,000.
The cumulative amount of capitalised interest included within investment and development properties at the year end is shown in note 12.

The breakdown of the numbers disclosed in the income statement in relation to these activities was as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Revenue 5,848 10,692 Cost of sales 6,738 5,545 Gross loss pro t 890 5,147 Administrative expenses 3,152 2,809 Loss pro t before tax on discontinued operations 4,042 2,338 Tax credit charge 1,213 701 2,829 1,637 At the end of the current financial year, Wembley Arena which had previously been operated by the Group as an entertainment venue was leased to a third party, Live Nation.
Throughout the year, to prepare for this transition, the Arena was closed for refurbishment but in order to preserve the goodwill associated with its business, was replaced by a temporary structure, known as the Pavilion.
The decision taken by the Board to cease to be involved in the business of operating the Arena as well as to terminate its conference and exhibition activities at Wembley has led to the classi cation of the results from these operations, which together constitute the most signi cant part of the Groups leisure activities, as discontinued.
In the Groups balance sheet, the Arena has been reclassi ed as an investment property while the sites currently occupied by the Conference Hall and the Exhibition Centres will revert to development land.
The net cash ow from discontinued operations included in net cash from operating activities is based on the numbers disclosed above, adjusted in the current year for the reorganisation provision, less related tax, referred to in note 6 on page 70.
There were no other cash ows from investing and nancing activities in relation to discontinued operations.
