55 ITV plc Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The Group accounts consolidate those of ITV plc, the Company, a company domiciled in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
As required by EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002 the Groups accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS.
The accounts are principally prepared on the historical cost basis.
Areas where other bases are applied are identified in the accounting policies below.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
The accounting policies set out below, except as noted above, have been applied consistently in presenting the consolidated financial information.
b Revenue recognition Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and consists of sales of goods and services to third parties.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control of the goods sold and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Key classes of revenue are recognised on the following basis: Advertising and sponsorship on transmission Programme production on delivery Programme rights when contracted and available for exploitation Participation revenues as the service is provided Revenue on barter transactions is recognised only when the goods or services being exchanged are of a dissimilar nature.
During the period, the Group has reviewed its revenue recognition policy for premium rate telephony services recognising the increasing significance of this revenue stream.
The Groups policy has consequently been revised to reflect revenue as the amount billed net of operator costs.
Previously revenue was shown net of other costs, such as production costs, in addition to operator costs.
2005 revenue and operating costs have therefore been restated, reflecting an increase in both of 19 million.
The impact of this change in accounting policy in 2006 was that revenue and operating costs are both 16 million higher than under the previous accounting policy.
2006 was the first full year of operation of ITV Play which also earns revenues from premium rate telephony services.
ITV Plays revenue and operating costs in 2006 would have been 34 million lower if the new accounting policy had not been adopted.
There is no effect on profit or the balance sheet.
c Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of an entity but is not control or joint control over those policies.
These investments are accounted for using the equity method.
d Current non-current distinction Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or consumption in, the course of the Groups operating cycle.
All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Groups operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
e Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under such leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is provided as appropriate.
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on a systematic basis.
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: Vehicles, equipment and fittings 3 to 13 years Plant and machinery 10 to 20 years Properties: television studios 40 to 60 years leaseholds shorter of residual lease term or 70 years Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 60 years 56 ITV plc Report and Accounts 2006 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued f Intangible assets Business combinations and goodwill All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair values of net assets acquired made within 12 months of the acquisition date are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
For business combinations prior to this date, but after 30 September 1998, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less amortisation up to 31 December 2003.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as permitted under IFRS 1.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to cash generating units.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 September 1998 was recognised as a deduction from equity.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation except those identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination which are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations less accumulated amortisation.
Identifiable intangible assets are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
The useful lives and amortisation methods for each major class of intangible asset are as follows: Film libraries Sum of digits 20 years Licences Straight line 11 to 17 years Brands Straight line up to 11 years Customer contracts Straight line up to 6 years Customer relationships Straight line 5 to 10 years Software development costs Straight line 3 to 5 years g Distribution rights Programme rights acquired primarily for the purposes of distribution are classified within the balance sheet as non-current assets.
They are recognised initially at cost and charged through the income statement over either a three or five year period depending on genre.
h Equity investments Equity investments comprise equity securities which do not meet the definition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised directly in the available for sale reserve in equity, unless the loss is a permanent impairment when it is recorded in the income statement.
i Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Where an asset such as goodwill relates to more than one cash-generating unit, impairment is tested against the cash flows of the group of cash-generating units related to that asset.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
j Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling during the financial period.
Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in the translation reserve in equity.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve within equity.
In respect of all foreign operations only those translation differences arising since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity as permitted under IFRS 1.
On disposal of an investment in a foreign operation the associated translation reserve balance is released to the income statement.
57 ITV plc Report and Accounts 2006 1 Accounting policies continued k Exceptional items Exceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the income statement, are items which due to their material and non-recurring nature have been classified separately in order to draw them to the attention of the reader of the accounts and to show more accurately the underlying profits of the Group.
l Programme rights Where programming, sports rights and film rights are acquired for the primary purpose of broadcasting, these are recognised within current assets.
An asset is recognised when the Group controls, in substance, the respective assets and the risks and rewards associated with them.
For acquired programme rights an asset is recognised as payments are made and is recognised in full when the acquired programming is available for transmission.
Programming produced internally either for the purpose of broadcasting or to be sold in the normal course of the Groups operating cycle is recognised within current assets at production cost.
Programme costs and rights, including those acquired under sale and leaseback arrangements, are written off to operating costs in full on first transmission except certain film rights which are written off over a number of transmissions.
Programme costs and rights not yet written off at the balance sheet date are included on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Outstanding sale and leaseback obligations, which comprise the principal and accrued interest are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreement is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on a systematic basis.
Sale and leaseback obligations are secured against an equivalent cash balance held within cash and cash equivalents.
m Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits with maturity of less than or equal to three months from the date of acquisition and cash held to meet certain finance lease commitments.
n Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and that the amount can be measured reliably.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by a rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability based on an appropriate gilt rate.
o Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost.
The difference between cost and redemption value is recorded in the income statement over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Where the Group has identified that any such liabilities result in a mismatch between the accounting liability and the related derivative, the Group has adopted the fair value option provision of IAS 39 revised.
Management consider that this fair value treatment is more appropriate than amortised cost as the movements in these financial instruments largely offset each other and, as a result, they are managed on an aggregated basis.
The effect of this is that the Group recognises any such financial liabilities at fair value in all periods subsequent to initial recognition, with resultant gains or losses recorded in the income statement.
At 31 December 2005, the Company had outstanding an unsecured 356 million Exchangeable Bond which matured in January 2007.
The Exchangeable Bond was able to be exchanged at any time at the option of investors for shares in Thomson SA at an exchange rate of 41.2 per share.
At 31 December 2005 the Thomson share price was 17.7, having traded below 24 since August 2002.
Independent market estimates were that the Thomson share price would not recover to the conversion price by January 2007.
The Company therefore took the view that the possibility of exchange before January 2007 was remote and classified the Exchangeable Bonds as a loan repayable between one and two years in the December 2005 balance sheet.
IAS 1.60 d states that a liability shall be classified as current when the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Although, as explained above, it is very unlikely that any bondholder would have exercised its option before January 2007, bondholders could technically exercise that right at any time.
Therefore the Company did not have an unconditional right to defer settlement.
Accordingly the Company has reclassified the liability as current in its 2005 balance sheet 245 million.
p Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than continuing use, they are available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets including those in disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet and classified as current assets or liabilities with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.
58 ITV plc Report and Accounts 2006 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued q Taxation The tax charge for the period comprises both current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: - the initial recognition of goodwill: - the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and - differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group has the right of set off.
r Employee benefits Defined contribution schemes Obligations under the Groups defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit schemes The Groups obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is deducted.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality corporate bonds.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Share based compensation The Group operates a number of share based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the equity instrument is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either a Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes model as appropriate taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual vesting except where forfeiture is due only to market based criteria not being achieved.
s ITV shares held by Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs Transactions of the Group-sponsored EBTs are included in the Groups accounts.
In particular, the EBTs purchases of shares in ITV plc are debited directly to equity.
t Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
u Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity in the period in which they are declared.
v Investment income Investment income comprises dividends received from the Groups investments.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the Groups right to receive payments is established.
w Net financing costs Net financing costs principally comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement and the expected return on pension scheme assets net of the interest cost on liabilities.
x Accounting estimates and judgements Details of significant accounting estimates and judgements have been disclosed under the relevant note or accounting policy for each area where disclosure is required.
Principally these are pensions, valuation of acquired intangible assets, goodwill impairment testing, fair value of derivatives and provisions.

A liquidation settlement of 2 million was received from the liquidators of the Shop!
Fees of 14 million were incurred in respect of the two takeover approaches received in 2006.
A 35 million net gain has been recognised from the sale of subsidiaries and the sale and impairment of investments.
This includes the profit on disposal of the stakes in Seven Network 29 million and TV3 40 million, the loss on sale of the education business 12 million and an impairment of the holding in SMG, which is held within the producer broadcaster segment, 22 million following a significant decline in its share price.
2005 exceptional items included a charge of 40 million incurred in respect of reorganisation and integration costs including the consolidation of regional news production centres and technical facilities and redundancy and share costs arising from the restructuring of the senior management team.
The largest element of this 25 million was staff related.
Also included in 2005 was an 11 million receipt from the liquidators of ONdigital.
A 10 million loss was recognised in relation to the education business after its classification as a disposal group held for sale.
6 Pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The pension scheme assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees to the fund is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
Defined contribution schemes Total contributions recognised as an expense in relation to defined contribution schemes during 2006 were 2 million 2005: 2 million.
Defined benefit schemes The Group provides retirement benefits to some of its former and approximately 31% of current employees through defined benefit schemes.
The Groups main scheme was formed from a merger of a number of schemes on 31 January 2006.
The level of retirement benefit is principally based on basic salary at retirement.
The liabilities of the defined benefit scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method.
This amount is reflected in the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an actuarial measure of the present value of benefits for service already rendered but differs from the projected unit method in that it includes an allowance for early leaver statutory revaluations rather than projected earning increases.
At the balance sheet date the accumulated benefit obligation was 2,580 million.
The statutory funding objective is that the scheme has sufficient and appropriate assets to pay its benefits as they fall due.
Future contributions will always be set at least at the level required to satisfy the statutory funding objective.
The general principles adopted by the trustees are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions and benefits already in payment to continue to be paid, and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pension rights.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuations in respect of the schemes forming the largest section of the Groups main retirement benefits fund was performed by an independent actuary for the trustees of the scheme and was carried out as at 1 January 2005.
As part of the merger exercise, the Group paid 325 million into the scheme towards the current deficit.
The first triennial valuation of the merged scheme is due to be completed as at 1 January 2008 in respect of the largest section and 31 December 2006 in respect of other sections.
In the interim the Group will monitor funding levels annually.
The levels of contributions are based on the current service costs and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit scheme.
The Group estimates the duration of UK scheme liabilities will on average fall due over 18 years.

The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value.
Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government.
The risk of default on these is very small.
The trustees also hold bonds issued by public companies.
There is a more significant risk of default on these which is assessed by various rating agencies.
The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity investments.
The investment return related to these is variable and they are generally considered much riskier investments.
It is generally accepted that the yield on equity investments will contain a premium the equity risk premium to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this type of investment.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of the risk premium.
The expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the asset allocation for 2007 to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The fair value of the scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets as at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 and target allocations for 2007 are set out below: The benchmark for 2007 is to hold broadly 60% equities and 40% bonds.
The majority of the equities held by the scheme are in international blue chip entities.
The aim is to hold a globally diversified portfolio of equities, with a target of 40% of equities being held in UK and 60% of equities held overseas.
Within the bond portfolio the aim is to hold 50% of the portfolio in government bonds gilts and 50% of the portfolio in corporate bonds.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31 December 2006 was 176 million 2005: 331 million.
Planned 2007 2006 2005 as a percentage of total scheme assets Equities and property 60% 61% 69% Bonds 40% 38% 30% Other 0% 1% 1% The principal assumptions used in the scheme valuations at the balance sheet date were: 2006 2005 Rate of general increase in salaries 4.25% 4.00% Rate of increase in pension payment LPI 5% pension increases 2.90% 2.75% Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.00% 2.75% Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.12% 4.90% Inflation assumption 3.00% 2.75% 66 ITV plc Report and Accounts 2006 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts 6 Pension schemes continued IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality fixed income investments.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.
The discount rate has been based on the yield available on AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to the liabilities.
The expected rate of inflation is an important building block for salary growth and pension increase assumption.
A rate of inflation is implied by the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds.
However, differences in demand for these can distort this implied figure.
The Bank of England target inflation rate has also been considered in setting this assumption.
The Group has used PA92 tables with mortality projected to 2015 2020 for pensioner members and to 2030 2035 for non-pensioner members.
Using these tables, the assumed life expectations on retirement at age 60 are: 2006 2005 Retiring today Males 24.4 24.0 Females 27.4 27.0 Retiring in 20 years Males 25.5 25.2 Females 28.4 28.1 The Group reflected this recognition that mortality rates have reduced in its 2004 valuation.
The tables above reflect published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the results of investigations into the mortality experience of scheme members.
The allowance for future mortality improvement has been increased from that incorporated for 2005 when mortality was projected to 2015 for pensioner members and to 2030 for non-pensioner members.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are set out below.
The illustrations consider the single change shown with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
The company liability is the difference between the scheme liabilities and the scheme assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets.
These may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the scheme liability, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value so there is no net effect on the company liability.
Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decrease increase by 8% Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 7% Rate of salary growth Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 1% Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 3% Normal contributions into the schemes in 2007 are expected to be in the region of 20 million assuming current contribution rates continuing as agreed with the scheme trustees.

The Granada Media and Granada Commitment schemes mirror the ITV scheme summarised in the remuneration report on page 94.
The main differences are as follows: 25% of the Matching Awards will vest for median ranking, and maximum vesting will occur only for first or second position out of a comparator group of 16 companies set out in the remuneration report on page 100.
The performance condition is tested in respect of 50% of the Matching Award on the second anniversary of the date of grant.
Any portion of the Matching Award which does not vest at that time may vest when the condition is again tested on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
Performance conditions were adjusted to take account of the merger.
The Granada Media, Granada, Carlton and ITV Sharesave schemes are Inland Revenue Approved SAYE schemes.
The Granada Media, Granada and Carlton Executive Option schemes are Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved schemes with three year performance periods.
For all options granted before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisfied on the merger of Carlton and Granada.
The performance conditions for options granted from December 2002 measure TSR against a comparator group of companies permitting exercise only if ITV is ranked above the median of this group.
The comparator group for Granada is set out in the remuneration report on page 99.
The comparator group for Carlton is the FTSE 100 at date of grant.
The Carlton Equity Participation Plan operated under similar terms to the ITV Commitment Scheme summarised in the remuneration report on page 94.
For all awards made before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisfied on the merger of Carlton and Granada.
For awards made from December 2002, 33% of the Matching Award vests at median with maximum vesting occurring when ITV ranks in the upper quartile against a comparator group of UK media companies.
The performance condition is tested on 1 April following the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Any proportion that does not vest at this time may vest when the condition is tested on 1 April following the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
The Carlton Deferred Annual Bonus Plan operated as a share award scheme.
Shares were purchased from bonus entitlements and held in trust for a three year period.
Matching shares were awarded and released after four years.
Exercises can be satisfied by market purchase or by new issue shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the Deferred Share Award Plan or nil-cost options under the Commitment Scheme.
However it is now Company practice to satisfy all option exercises where possible by using shares purchased in the market and held in the Granada, Carlton and ITV Employees Benefit Trusts rather than by issuing new shares.
ITV plc was formed on the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications Plc on 2 February 2004.
The Executive Option Schemes, Commitment Schemes and Performance Share Plans all have market based performance conditions which are taken into account in the fair value calculation using a Monte Carlo pricing model.
The Black-Scholes model is used to value the Sharesave Schemes as these do not have any market performance conditions.
Share-based payment charges totalled 22 million in 2006 2005: 21 million.
Of these 7 million have been shown within exceptional items 2005: 4 million.

The underlying tax rate on profits, after adjusting for the irregular tax effects caused by issues such as exceptional items, impairments, joint ventures and associates and adjustments in respect of prior periods, is 30% 2005: 28%.
The current tax expense for the year is reduced primarily as a result of the reversal of temporary differences on which deferred tax assets previously were recognised relating to pension scheme deficits and funding payments.
A tax expense totalling 4 million 2005: expense of 8 million has been recognised directly in equity representing a current tax credit of 2 million 2005: credit of 2 million and a deferred tax expense of 6 million 2005: expense of 10 million.

Deferred tax assets estimated at 600 million and 100 million 2005: 600 million and 100 million in respect of capital losses and loan relationship deficits respectively, have not been recognised due to uncertainties as to amount and whether gain or income will arise in the appropriate form and relevant territory against which such losses could be utilised.
For the same reasons, deferred tax assets in respect of overseas losses of 10 million 2005: 10 million which time expire between 2017 and 2026 have not been recognised.

The 20 million impairment charge in 2006 related to Carlton Screen Advertising cash-generating unit as a result of structural changes in the cinema advertising market.
In calculating this impairment, growth rates and discount rates consistent with those noted below have been used, and calculations have been made on a value in use basis, using cash flow projections over the next four years.
Carlton Screen Advertising is part of the Other operations segment.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2006 2005 m m 2,963 2,963 Broadcasting Multiple units without individually significant goodwill 460 462 3,423 3,425 The recoverable amount of the Broadcasting cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations.
Those calculations use cash flow projections based on actual operating results and the five year business plan.
Cash flows in perpetuity are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate and are appropriate because broadcasting is a long-term business.
The growth rate used is consistent with the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12.5% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.

Treasury policies have been approved by the Board for managing each of these exposures including levels of authority on the type and use of financial instruments.
Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures.
The treasury department reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board and treasury operations are subject to periodic independent reviews and internal audit.
Financing The Groups financing policy for long term funding is to use debt instruments with a range of maturities.
It is substantially funded from the UK and European capital markets and has bank facilities from the UK syndicated market.
Interest rate management The Groups interest rate policy is to be between 30% and 70% fixed on its forecast net indebtedness over the medium term in order to provide a balance between certainty of cost and benefit from low floating rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and options in order to achieve the desired mix between fixed and floating rates.
Currency management The Groups foreign exchange policy is to hedge foreign currency denominated costs at the time of commitment and to hedge a proportion of foreign currency denominated revenues on a rolling 12 month basis.
It is also the Groups policy to hedge major balance sheet exposures.
The policies significantly reduce the Groups income statement and balance sheet exposures to changes in exchange rates.
Investment in cash The Group operates strict investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash and the emphasis is on preservation of capital.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies.
Deposits longer than three months require the approval of the Management Committee of the Board.
b Measurement Equity investments Equity investments are detailed in note 15.
The fair value is based on year end quoted prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales proceeds for other investments.
Cash equivalents The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments.

Bonds accounted for using the fair value approach are valued at fair value based on ask price with the resultant gains or losses recorded in the income statement in accordance with our accounting policy which prevents an accounting mismatch.
Interest rate swaps and options All interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices.
The fair value of these instruments at 31 December 2006 was 25 million 31 December 2005: 19 million.
Other current assets and liabilities No disclosure of fair value has been made as the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The investments are being sold as they are not core to the Groups main activities.
Additionally six freehold properties and certain assets connected to an outsourcing arrangement completed in January 2007 are also classified as held for sale, for which a 1 million loss has been recognised on reclassification.
Four of the properties were reclassified from property, plant and equipment, with the remaining two having previously been held under operating leases and purchased in 2006.

Enable Media operates online business directories trading under the name Scoot.
As part of the acquisition, loan amounts due by Enable Media totalling 1 million were repaid, bringing the total cash outflow of the Group to 3 million.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2006, the estimated revenue for the Group would have been 2 million higher at 2,183 million and operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items would have been 1 million higher at 376 million.

The goodwill recognised represents the wider benefits of this acquisition to the ITV Consumer division, and of those intangible assets not requiring valuation under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets methodology Valuation of acquired intangible assets has been performed in accordance with industry standard practice.
Methods applied are designed to isolate the value of each intangible asset separately from the other assets of the business.
The value of brands are assessed by applying a royalty rate to the expected future revenues over the life of the brand.
Licences are valued on a start-up basis.
Customer relationships and controls are valued based on expected future cash flows from those existing at the date of acquisition.
Contributory charges from other assets are taken as appropriate with post tax cash flows then being discounted back to their present value.
Typical discount rates applied in the valuation of intangible assets acquired in the period are 8% 13%.
Friends Reunited contingent consideration During the year, the Group has re-estimated the amount of contingent consideration payable following the acquisition of Friends Reunited in 2005.
Due to the strong performance of the business, the Group now expects to pay the full 55 million of deferred consideration which has resulted in an increase in the goodwill associated with the acquisition of 15 million less related deferred tax of 5 million recognised through equity and a 10 million increase in operating costs which will be spread over the three year performance period which commenced in 2006.
80 ITV plc Report and Accounts 2006 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts 28 Acquisitions and disposals of businesses continued Disposals During the period, as part of the ongoing process to dispose of non-core businesses and investments, the Group sold 021 and Granada Learning and its investments in Seven Network and TV3.
The disposal of the 021 business for 4 million resulted in a nil gain or loss being booked.
The sale of Granada Learning took place for a potential maximum consideration of 53 million.
This comprises 17.5 million in cash, 17.5 million in loan notes and a further 18 million which is contingent on the future performance of the business.
The fair value of expected proceeds has been taken as 31 million for accounting purposes resulting in a 12 million loss on disposal.
The interest in Seven Network was sold for total consideration of 87 million resulting in a profit of 29 million booked through the income statement.
The interest in TV3 was sold for a total consideration of 70 million resulting in a profit of 40 million booked through the income statement.

A deferred tax liability of 25 million was recognised in respect of these intangible assets.
The goodwill recognised represents the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition to ITV plc and the value of those assets not requiring valuation under IFRS3 Business combinations.
The strategic benefits are principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex A and the additional capacity available from 2010.
These, in combination with existing Group assets including the ITV brand and programming, generated the goodwill on acquisition.
Friends Reunited On 6 December 2005, the Group agreed to acquire 100% of the shares in Friends Reunited Holdings Limited for a total initial consideration of 120 million and contingent consideration of up to 55 million payable in 2009 contingent upon the future performance of the acquired business.
The initial consideration consisted of 75 million cash, 21 million loan notes and 24 million ITV plc shares.
Of the initial consideration 94 million was paid in 2005 with the balance of 26 million paid in 2006 being the 21 million 24 million ITV plc shares and 2 million loan notes.
The fair value of the consideration was 145 million.
This took into account the initial consideration, the present value of the expected deferred consideration and other costs associated with the acquisition.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2005, the estimated revenue for the Group would have been 12 million higher at 2,208 million and operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items 6 million higher at 466 million additional amortisation would have been 4 million for the year ended 31 December 2005.

Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost.
The difference between cost and redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with movement recorded in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
