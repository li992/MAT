Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Share-based payments The fair value of share-based remuneration at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the profit and loss account takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
Preference shares Preference shares are treated as borrowings, and dividends payable on those preference shares are charged as interest in the profit and loss account.
