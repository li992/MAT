Topps has applied this only to options or schemes awarded after 7 November 2002 and therefore this only includes employee share save schemes as no executive share options were granted after this date.
The cumulative effect to 1 October 2005 is a charge of 100,000 to the Retained Earnings.
b IFRS 3 Goodwill and Business Combinations Topps has elected to take the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to Goodwill: accordingly the value of Goodwill has been frozen at the carrying value at 2 October 2004.
Under IFRS Goodwill should not be amortised but is subject to an impairment review annually or more frequently if events or changes occur which may significantly affect the value.
The effect of the change to IFRS was to reverse the charge of 34,000 to the income statement for the year ended 1 October 2005 thereby increasing income for the year and retained earnings by this amount.
c IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet date IAS 10 requires that dividends should now be recognised only when they are declared and approved rather than being accrued for in the period to which they relate as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
On transition to IFRS 13,593,000 at 2 October 2004 was credited to retained earnings.
In addition, dividends are to be shown as a movement directly in equity instead of through the Income Statement.
d IAS 17 Leases Under UK GAAP operating lease incentives in respect of rent free periods were recognised in the profit and loss account over the period to the date of the first rent review.
IAS 17 states that the incentives must be recognised over the length of the lease.
The effect of this is that Topps is carrying an increased amount of 554,000 for deferred lease incentives as at 1 October 2005 and a charge of 6,000 for the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2005. e IAS 31 Jointly Controlled Entities IAS 31 requires that Topps should recognise in the financial statements its share of the joint assets, any liabilities that it has incurred directly and its share of any liabilities incurred jointly with the other entities.
Income from the sale or use of its share of the output of its jointly controlled entity, the share of its expenses and expenses incurred directly in respect of its interest in the joint venture are presented after tax in one single line in the income statement.
f IAS 32 & 39 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation & Recognition and Measurement Profits and losses on financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
In accordance with IFRS 1, comparative information has not been restated for the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39, but the Group has only adopted these standards to apply from 1 October 2005.
