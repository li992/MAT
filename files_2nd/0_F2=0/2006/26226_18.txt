Coupon payments on both subordinated issues may be deferred if no dividend is paid on the Groups ordinary shares.
The sterling undated subordinated notes are treated as upper tier II capital for regulatory purposes and the Euro dated subordinated notes as lower tier II capital.
The Company has issued 400m of 5.875% undated subordinated notes.
These notes are callable on 1 April 2019 and every five years thereafter.
If not called, the coupon from 1 April 2019 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 2.33% pa. As at 31 December 2005, the undated subordinated notes were classied as equity because their perpetual nature meant that in certain circumstances interest could be deferred indefinitely.
On 13 March 2006, the Group entered into a supplementary deed to remove the discretionary nature of the interest.
This had the effect of reclassifying the notes from equity to liability and coupon payments from distributions to interest.
Upon reclassication the new debt component was recognised at fair value.
The Company has also issued 600m of 4.0% Euro dated subordinated notes.
The proceeds were swapped into sterling.

The facility also has a one year extension option at the end of 2007.
The maturity prole above is calculated on the basis that a facility to renance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If renancing under the Companys syndicated facility was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassied as repayable between one and five years.
The effective interest rate is the rate which exactly discounts future cash payments over the life of the borrowing and will include all transaction costs and premia or discounts on issue.
For the 5.875% sterling undated subordinated notes the effective rate includes the impact of reclassication of the notes from equity to debt on 13 March 2006 at fair value.
iii Convertible bonds The convertible bond matured in 2006 and was redeemed at par without being converted into ordinary shares.
The debt component, net of expenses, of the convertible bond recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 2006 2005 m m Balance at 1 January 509 493 Interest expense 30 30 Coupons paid 14 14 Repayment of debt 525 Balance at 31 December 509 The fair value of the debt component of the convertible bond at 31 December 2005 was 517m.
