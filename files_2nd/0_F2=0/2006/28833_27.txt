Royal & SunAlliance 60 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Segment reporting The Groups internal reporting is organised into distinguishable components based on the major geographical regions in which it operates.
These components represent the primary format for reporting segment information.
The secondary segment reporting format is the Groups business segments: Personal and Commercial.
Items of segment revenue, segment expense, segment assets and segment liabilities include amounts of such items that are directly attributable to a segment and amounts of such items that can be allocated to a segment on a reasonable basis.
Items are allocated consistently, such that an item of segment revenue is allocated to the segment that holds the income generating asset.
Transfers or transactions between segments are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.

Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs as follows: 2006 2005 m m UK 43 3 International 51 51 Scandinavia 119 98 When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cashflows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which do not exceed the long term average past growth rate for the insurance business in which the CGU operates.
A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Group Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate.
The discount rates used are pre tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.

The rate of interest payable on the US$ bonds is 8.95%.
On 20 April 2006, the Parent Company announced an offer to exchange any or all of the outstanding $500m Yankee Bonds for subordinated Sterling perpetual guaranteed bonds New Bonds.
Holders of $425,694,000 of the outstanding nominal amount of the Yankee Bonds participated in the offering, which was settled on 12 May 2006.
The balance of the Yankee Bonds that remain outstanding following the closing of the transaction was $74,306,000.
On 20 April 2006, the Parent Company also announced a tender for any or all of the outstanding $500m Yankee Bonds.
Yankee Bonds with a nominal value of $708,000 were tendered for settlement on 22 May 2006.
A further $419,000 were repurchased and cancelled on 13 November 2006.
The outstanding Yankee Bonds at 31 December 2006 have a nominal value of $73,179,000.
On 22 February 2007, the Group repurchased Yankee Bonds with nominal value of $49,500,000 for a total consideration of $68m including accrued interest of $1.5m.
Yankee Bonds with nominal value of $23,679,000 remain.
The subordinated guaranteed Euro bonds 500m have a redemption date of 15 October 2019.
200m of the Euro bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.875% until 15 October 2009 and a floating rate thereafter.
300m of the Euro bonds bear interest at a floating rate from the date of issue of EURIBOR 1.25%.
The Parent Company has the option to repay the Euro bonds on specific dates from 15 October 2009.
New Bonds were issued under an offer to exchange any or all of the Yankee Bonds.
This exchange improves the regulatory capital position of the Group by replacing the Yankee Bonds, which do not qualify as regulatory capital, with an innovative Tier 1 regulatory capital instrument under the FSAs General Prudential Sourcebook.
This exchange is not accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability Yankee Bonds and the recognition of a new financial liability New Bonds because the discounted present value of the cashflows under the terms of the New Bonds including net fees paid discounted using the effective interest rate of the Yankee Bonds, is less than 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cashflows of the Yankee Bonds.
The carrying value of the Yankee Bonds exchanged at the date of the exchange became the carrying value of the New Bonds issued in the exchange.
After charging expenses directly relating to the exchange of 3m, the carrying value of the New Bonds immediately after the exchange was 222m.
The nominal value of the New Bonds issued in the exchange transaction is 297,279,000.
In addition to the New Bonds issued under the exchange, New Bonds with a nominal value of 77,721,000 were issued at par for cash consideration of 77m net of directly related expenses of 1m on the same terms as the New Bonds issued under the exchange.
In total, New Bonds with a nominal value of 375,000,000 were issued on 12 May 2006.
The New Bonds are step up perpetual guaranteed subordinated capital securities and the rate of interest payable is 6.701% of the nominal value.
The Group has the option to repay the bonds on specific dates starting 12 July 2017.
If the bonds are not repaid, from that date, the rate of interest payable would be LIBOR 2.51%.
The subordinated guaranteed perpetual notes have a nominal value of 450m and pay an annual coupon of 8.50% with an option to call the notes, or if not called for the coupon rate to be reset, on 8 December 2014 and every five years thereafter.
During 2005, the terms of the subordinated guaranteed perpetual notes were revised with the effect that their classification under IFRS changed from being equity instruments to debt instruments.
In the 2005 financial statements, the reclassification was accounted for as an exchange transaction as the underlying terms of the notes were not substantially impacted by the variation in terms and there were no changes in the holders of the notes immediately before and immediately after the change.
During 2006, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC provided guidance on its understanding of accounting for such a change in terms.
The directors have considered the IFRICs deliberations and concluded that the Company should change its accounting treatment.
The accounting treatment now recognises the impact of the revision of the terms of the notes as if the revision had given rise to a redemption of the equity instrument in exchange for a debt instrument, which is measured at the fair value of the notes at the date of the revision.
The carrying value of the notes included in the 2005 results has been increased by 81m and a corresponding deferred tax asset of 24m has been recognised in accordance with this revised accounting treatment.
Opening shareholders funds have been restated by the net amount of 57m, of which 24m was recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense and 81m was recognised directly in equity.
The bonds and the notes are contractually subordinated to all other creditors of the Parent Company such that in the event of a winding up or of bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other creditors have been met.
The aggregate fair value of the dated loan capital, subordinated Sterling perpetual guaranteed bonds, and subordinated guaranteed perpetual notes at 31 December 2006 is 1,291m 2005: 1,271m.

The movement in the 2001 and prior years primarily reflects the strengthening of our UK asbestos reserves by 169m, and our long tail Scandinavian reserves by 260m.
The positive run off in the years 2002 to 2005 comes from all main businesses and reflects the benefits of recent management actions as well as the release of surplus reserves within our Danish motor business.
The total discounting of 572m compares with 462m in 2005, with the increase predominantly reflecting the impact of the increase in UK asbestos reserves.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes, and has other post retirement obligations.
This note has been adjusted for discontinued operations.
Defined contribution pension schemes Costs of 30m 2005: 28m were recognised in respect of defined contribution schemes by the Group.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this plan, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution plan in accordance with Section 30 of IAS 19.
Contributions of 9m were paid to this plan during 2006 and are included in the costs shown above.
The latest information regarding the funding of this plan is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2006, when the scheme funding rate was 118%.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries share of the total multi employer plan was less than 15%.
Royal & SunAlliance Annual Report & Accounts 2006 81 26.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held mainly in separate trustee administered funds.
The US defined benefit schemes are included in discontinued operations.
In April 2002, the primary UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants and in 2005, following discussions with the Trustees and consultation with the members, the UK defined benefit schemes were altered from providing benefits on a final salary basis to benefits on a revalued average salary basis with effect from 1 January 2006.
Under the new benefit formula, the accrued benefits of current active members are based on salaries at the date of change and will increase in line with inflation each year limited to 5% in any year up to their retirement date.
Benefits earned in each year from 1 January 2006 will be based on salaries in that year and similarly will be revalued up to retirement.
As a result of the changes, the projected benefit obligations of the schemes are reduced from the date of change.
The figures shown in the tables below reflect that reduction and the one-off benefit of 180m arising from the reduction was recorded in the income statement in 2005.
In addition to these changes, the 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees have been admitted since the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new members has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK will accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder plan.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2006 were 23% and 21% of pensionable salaries 2005: 23% and 21%.
Additional contributions totalling 86m 2005: 86m were made to the schemes, in accordance with the plan to reduce their deficits.
Expected contributions to pension and post retirement benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2007 are approximately 175m, including a further 86m of additional contributions.
The major defined benefit schemes are subject to regular valuation using the projected unit method which is the basis of the pension cost in the consolidated income statement.
Independent, qualified actuaries carry out valuations of the major defined benefit schemes for the purposes of assessing pension costs.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired US and Canadian employees.
The benefits are not pre funded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Expected return on plan assets The weighted average expected return on assets across the Group for 2006 was 6.0% 2005: 6.1%.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates of return from the main asset classes and from rates of return assumed elsewhere within the operation of the business.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the scheme actuaries for their funding valuations.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the PMA92 and PFA92 mortality tables for males and females respectively, with age ratings to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates were allowed for using the medium cohort projection and using the projected mortality rates applicable to calendar year 2012 for current pensioners and 2030 for future pensioners.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 24.7 years males and 26.8 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 has a future lifetime of 26.1 years males and 28.1 years females.
Commutation Each of the UK defined benefit pension schemes have changed their rules to allow for increased commutation following A day in April 2006.
The commutation factors are currently under review, but it is expected that the final factors will be cost neutral on the IAS 19 basis ie when valued on the IAS 19 basis, the amount of cash taken is approximately equal to the value of the pension being given up.
For this reason there is no change made to previous practice whereby the accounting valuation makes no allowance for commutation.
Post retirement medical benefits The valuation of liabilities for post retirement liabilities in Canada assumes 9% decreasing to 5% in eight years for drugs 2005: 10% decreasing to 5% in 9 years and 4% 2005: 4% for hospitals and 3% 2005: 3% for other.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate and the assumed inflation rate both have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
A 0.1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the defined benefit obligation in the UK by 78m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation in the UK by 68m.
The effect of an increase of one percentage point and the effect of a decrease of one percentage point in the assumed medical cost trend rates on the following is set out below: 1% increase 1% decrease 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m Aggregate of the current service cost and interest components of net periodic post employment medical costs 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 Accumulated post employment benefit obligation for medical costs 2.8 3.1 2.3 2.5 27.
Share based compensation The Group has five types of share based payment plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares: the Executive Share Option: the Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees: the International Sharesave Plan: the Share Matching Plan: and the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within ABI limits.
In addition, in the US there are a number of cash settled share based payment plans.
The total employment cost recorded in the income statement for all plans was 13m in 2006 2005: 9m.
These costs include the costs associated with plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares for awards that have been granted after 7 November 2002.
The value of equity settled awards granted prior to this date have been excluded in accordance with the transitional provisions contained in IFRS 2.
Executive Share Option Scheme and Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme and an Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees, which provide options to purchase ordinary shares to officers and other key employees at prices not less than the fair value of the ordinary shares at the date of grant.
The exercise of awards made under the Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees can be accelerated dependent on the performance of the US subsidiary to between one and three years.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme are described in the footnote to the options table audited part on page 42.
The exercise price of all options is the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options expire 10 years after the date of the grant.
Royal & SunAlliance Annual Report & Accounts 2006 85 27.
Under the schemes, there were no awards during 2006.
The weighted average estimated fair value per option granted by the Company during 2005 was 27.42p.
The fair value of the share options granted under the plans during 2005 was 8m.
The value of the awards is charged in the income statement over the vesting period.
Fair values for the options granted under the schemes during 2005 were estimated as of the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend yields of 5.0%: expected volatilities of 50%: risk free interest rates of 4.4%: expected terms of five years for Executive Share Option Scheme grants made prior to the 2003 AGM, four years for Executive Share Option Scheme grants made after the 2003 AGM and four years for grants made under the Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees: and the assumption that all performance criteria are expected to be met.
An estimate based on past experience is made of the number of forfeitures during the vesting period due to employees leaving the Group.
Royal & SunAlliance 86 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 27.
Share based compensation continued International Sharesave Plan Under the Groups International Sharesave Plan savings related eligible employees can receive options to purchase ordinary shares at a price equal to 80% of the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options vest either three or five years from the grant date and expire six months after vesting.
The number of shares available for purchase from the plan by each participant is limited to the whole number of shares purchasable from the aggregate value of the individuals savings contract upon maturity.
An individuals maximum monthly contribution to all current savings contracts is 250.
The following share options under the International Sharesave Plan are outstanding or exercisable as of 31 December: Options outstanding 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted average average remaining Weighted remaining Weighted Number contractual life average Number contractual life average Range of exercise prices of shares years exercise price of shares years exercise price 50.1 100.0 49,934,125 1.98 68.55 58,565,114 2.95 68.83 100.1 150.0 9,421,988 3.67 108.39 200.1 250.0 104,201 0.09 250.00 134,287 1.09 250.00 250.1 300.0 577,671 292.00 300.1 350.0 504,279 310.00 715,047 0.75 313.76 350.1 400.0 145,424 354.00 59,964,593 2.22 77.16 60,137,543 2.89 74.98 Price refers to weighted average exercise price in sterling pence.
Under the International Sharesave Plan, the weighted average estimated fair value per option granted by the Company during 2006 was 46.66p 2005: 36.62p.
The fair value of share options granted under the International Sharesave Plan during 2006 was 4m 2005: 6m.
Fair values for the options granted under the International Sharesave Plan were estimated as of the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend yields of 3.5% 2005: 5.0% : expected volatilities of 35% 2005: 50% : risk free interest rates of 4.8% 2005: 4.2% : and expected terms equal to the vesting terms of three or five years.

Share based compensation continued Share Matching Plan The Groups Share Matching Plan for executive directors and other selected executives was adopted following approval obtained at the 2004 AGM.
Awards were made during 2004 and 2005 and the awards granted in 2005 were the final awards under the plan.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Share Matching Plan are described in the footnote to the options table audited part on page 43.
Under the plan, Deferred Share awards granted are held in trust for three years and are normally forfeited upon an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
Participants may also receive Matching Share awards up to a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded.
Matching Share awards are subject to the achievement of total shareholder return targets over a single two year period, with performance measured by comparison against other UK listed companies.
Matching Share awards vest with the Deferred Share awards on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Further information on the Share Matching Plan may be found in the footnote to the long term incentive scheme table audited part on page 43.
Additional information with respect to Deferred and Matching Share awards at 31 December is as follows: 2006 2005 Shares Shares Outstanding Deferred Share awards at 1 January 4,075,168 1,559,056 Granted 150,000 2,704,444 Exercised 310,847 25,374 Forfeited 480,601 162,958 Outstanding Deferred Share awards at 31 December 3,433,720 4,075,168 Potential Matching Share awards 8,230,850 12,225,504 Total potential share awards outstanding at 31 December 11,664,570 16,300,672 There is no price for the Share Matching Plan.
This award was approved in 2005, but could not be granted until 2006.
It is subject to the same criteria as all the other grants made in 2005.
Under the Share Matching Plan, the fair values of each Deferred Share award granted by the Company during 2006 was 114.40p 2005: 71.40p and the fair value of each potential Matching Share award was 38.10p 2005: 23.80p.
The total fair value of the awards granted under the plan during 2006 was nil 2005: 4m.
The fair value of the Deferred Share awards was calculated based upon the ordinary share price at grant date after deducting from it the estimated value of the dividends that will not be received during the vesting period.
The fair value of the potential Matching Share awards was estimated by calculating the expected value arising from modelling the awards that would arise under different performance scenarios.
Long Term Incentive Plan The 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and other selected executives was adopted following approval obtained at the 2006 AGM.
Awards were made during 2006 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus : in addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as compulsory Deferred Shares.
Deferred shares are held in trust for three years and compulsory Deferred Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to voluntary and compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives, and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to voluntary Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Further information on the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan may be found in the remuneration report.

Under the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, the weighted average estimated fair value of each Restricted Share award granted by the Company in 2006 was 114.81p.
The fair value of each voluntary Deferred Share award was nil and the fair value of each potential associated Matching Share was 126.00p.
The fair value of each compulsory Deferred Share award was 127.00p and the fair value of each potential associated Matching Share was 87.85p.
The fair value of each Performance Share award granted was 88.71p.
The total fair value of the awards granted under the plan in 2006 was 18m.
Fair values of the awards granted under the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan during 2006 are taken to be the share price on the day preceding the grant date, except for the Restricted Shares where the share price is reduced by an estimate of the value of dividends that will not be received.
A dividend yield of 3.5% was assumed.
Market related performance criteria were based on an arithmetic mean estimate of performance against a specified group of 13 competitors: and it is assumed that all non market related performance criteria would be met such that all awards would vest.
Other share based payments In the US, there are plans under which awards have been granted to certain employees in the form of cash settled share based awards.
Under these plans, if the vesting conditions are satisfied, cash awards are made based upon the underlying performance of the Companys ordinary shares.
Awards were made in 1999 and 2001 under old schemes and during 2004 and 2005 on terms that provide the same potential benefits as the Share Matching Plan.
The liability in respect of these plans at 31 December 2006 was 2m 2005: 1m.
The intrinsic value of awards that had vested at 31 December 2006 was nil 2005: nil.
Management of risks As an insurance company, the Group is fundamentally concerned with the management of risk.
This note, which has been adjusted for the discontinued operations, summarises these risks and the way the Group manages them.
As set out in the corporate governance report, the Groups Board defines the risk appetite of the organisation.
The Group employs a comprehensive risk management framework to identify, assess, manage and monitor the risks arising as a result of operating the business.
The framework includes a comprehensive suite of risk policies, procedures, measurement and monitoring techniques and a series of stress tests and scenario analyses to ensure that the Groups exposures do not exceed risk appetite.
The Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets, financial liabilities investment contracts and borrowings, reinsurance assets and insurance liabilities.
In particular the key financial risk is that the proceeds from the realisation of its financial assets are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising from its insurance and investment contracts.
The Group manages its financial assets within a framework that has been developed to seek to ensure the ability to meet its obligations under insurance and investment contracts.
A key principle behind this process is to hold assets that provide a broad match against the liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts.
Risks arise within the investment portfolio from the possibility of mismatching cash and fixed interest assets against liabilities by duration eg inflation and reinvestment risk.
However, the relatively short duration of a general insurance portfolio, together with the Groups strategy of broadly matching assets and liabilities by duration, provides mitigation against these risks.
The Group reviews the duration of its liabilities and asset portfolios to ensure that they remain broadly matched.
Regional investment directives limit permissible duration ranges within the individual portfolios.
These directives also include objectives for liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.
Royal & SunAlliance Annual Report & Accounts 2006 89 28.
Management of risks continued The components of risk: insurance, reinsurance, credit, market and liquidity risks are addressed below: Insurance risk The Groups insurance activities are primarily concerned with the pricing, acceptance and management of risks from its customers.
In accepting risk the Group is committing to the payment of claims and therefore these risks must be understood and controlled.
The Group manages its exposure to insurance risk through the Board Risk Committee BRC which considers aggregation of risk and establishes how much risk the Group is willing to assume.
The BRC also oversees an emerging risk identification process, including the identification of emerging issues and the setting of these into risk scenarios as part of an overall process of self appraisal.
For a portfolio of insurance contracts where the theory of probability is applied to pricing and provisioning, the principal risk that the Group faces under its insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments exceed the expected amount of the insurance liabilities.
This could occur because the frequency or severity of claims and benefits payable are greater than estimated.
Insurance events are random and the actual number and amount of claims and benefits will vary from year to year from the estimate established using statistical techniques.
Experience shows that the larger the portfolio of similar insurance contracts, the smaller will be the relative variability about the expected outcome.
In addition, a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the board by a change in any subset of the portfolio.
The Group has developed its insurance underwriting strategy to diversify the type of insurance risks accepted and within each of these categories to achieve a sufficiently large population of risks to reduce the variability of the expected outcome.
Further discussion on underwriting risk and pricing, estimation of claims provisions, emerging and legal risks and aggregation of risks is set out below.
Underwriting risk and pricing Disciplined underwriting, encompassing risk assessment, risk management, pricing and exposure control is critical to the Groups success.
The Group has an Underwriting and Claims Policy that clearly identifies the approach to be adopted in respect of risk selection and management, pricing adequacy, identification and management of aggregation to exposure and claims handling.
These principles are adapted to local market, legal and regulatory environments and further embodied in detailed underwriting procedures.
The goal is for the Groups underwriters to be in a position to: Understand and assess each risk, Make appropriate decisions within their area of competence and authority limits, Differentiate between risks, Price risks appropriately, Apply suitable terms and conditions in order to manage the portfolio, Control exposure, Improve the predictability of the loss experience and make appropriate use of the Groups underwriting capacity.
In establishing prices, each of the Groups businesses has access to extensive customer data from its own records and access to appropriate market data.
All of the Groups underwriters have specific licenses that set clear parameters for the business they can underwrite, based on the experience of the individual underwriter.
Additionally, the Group has a centrally managed forum looking at Group underwriting issues, reviewing and agreeing underwriting direction and setting policy and directives where appropriate.
The Group has a quarterly portfolio management process across all its business units, which provides a consistent assessment of each portfolio performance against a set of key performance indicators.
Under the portfolio management system, key risk indicators are tracked to monitor emerging trends, opportunities and risks and on an annual basis a review forum of business and underwriting leaders undertake a detailed review of each portfolio utilising data from the quarterly review.
Pricing for property and casualty products is generally based upon historical claims frequencies and claims severity averages, adjusted for inflation and trended forward to recognise anticipated changes in claims patterns.
While claims remain the Groups principal cost, the Group also makes allowance in the pricing procedures for acquisition expenses, administration expenses, investment income, the cost of reinsurance and for a profit loading that adequately covers the cost of the capital the Group exposes to risk.
The BRC performs the following functions: Establishes how much risk the Group is willing to assume, Provides an emerging risk identification process, including the identification of emerging issues and the setting of these into risk scenarios for consideration by the regions as part of an overall process of self appraisal, Royal & SunAlliance 90 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 28.
Management of risks continued Considers aggregation of risk across regions, Maintains and develops the Group risk management framework, Monitors and reports on the Groups approach to managing risks.
Specific considerations in relation to casualty insurance risks and property insurance risks are set out below: Casualty insurance risks The Group manages these risks through its underwriting strategy, adequate reinsurance arrangements and proactive claims handling.
The underwriting strategy attempts to ensure that the underwritten risks are well diversified in terms of type and amount of risk, industry and geography.
Underwriting limits are in place to enforce appropriate risk selection criteria.
For example, the Group has the right not to renew individual policies, it can impose deductibles and it has the right to reject the payment of a fraudulent claim.
In certain territories, legislation requires that the maximum loss under each employers liability contract is never lower than a prescribed amount.
All the Group employers liability contracts offer maximum cover in compliance with such minimums.
Reinsurance arrangements in place include excess, stop loss and catastrophe coverage.
The effect of such reinsurance arrangements is that the Group should not suffer total net insurance losses of more than a specified amount in any one year.
In addition to the overall Group reinsurance programme, individual business units are permitted to purchase additional reinsurance protection.
The Group has specialised claims units dealing with the mitigation of risks surrounding known asbestos claims.
These units investigate and adjust all asbestos claims.
The asbestos claims are reviewed individually at least semi annually and adjusted to reflect the latest information on the underlying facts, current law, jurisdiction, contractual terms and conditions and other factors.
The Group actively manages and pursues early settlements of asbestos claims to reduce its exposure to unpredictable developments.
Property insurance Property insurance covers a diverse collection of risks and therefore property insurance contracts are subdivided into four risk groups: fire, business interruption, weather damage and theft.
The insurance risk arising from these contracts is not concentrated in any of the territories in which the Group operates, and there is a balance between commercial and personal properties in the overall portfolio of insured buildings.
Large risks are reinsured via treaty reinsurance arrangements.
The Group has the right to reprice the risk on renewal.
It also has the ability to impose deductibles and reject fraudulent claims.
These contracts are underwritten by reference to the commercial replacement value of the properties and contents insured, and claims payment limits are always included to limit the amount payable on occurrence of the insured event.
Cost of rebuilding properties, of replacement or indemnity for contents and time taken to restart operations for business interruption are the key factors that influence the level of claims under these policies.
The greatest likelihood of significant losses on these contracts arises from storm, flood damage or other weather related incidents.
The Group has reinsurance cover for such damage to limit losses.
Reserves an overview The Group establishes property and casualty loss reserves to account for the anticipated ultimate costs of all losses and related loss adjustment expenses LAE on losses that have already occurred.
The Group establishes reserves for reported losses and LAE, as well as for incurred but not yet reported IBNR losses and LAE.
Loss reserve estimates are based on known facts and on interpretation of circumstances including our experience with similar cases and historical claims payment trends.
The Group also considers the development of loss payment trends, levels of unpaid claims, judicial decisions and economic conditions.
The Group uses a variety of statistical techniques and a number of different bases to set reserves, depending on the business unit and line of business in question.
Our reserving managers consider claims developments separately for each line of business and subdivide certain lines of business by major claim types or sub classifications of business.
Large claims impacting each relevant account are also generally assessed separately: either being reserved at the face value of the loss adjusters estimates or projected separately in order to allow for the future development of large claims.
The Group has a Group Reserving Committee consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group Director Audit, Risk and Compliance and Group Chief Actuary.
A similar committee has been established in each of the Groups major regions.
The Group Reserving Committee monitors the decisions and judgments made by the business units as to the level of reserves recommended and makes the final decision on the reserves to be included within the financial statements.
In making its judgment, the Group Reserving Committees aim is that, over the longer term, reserves should be more likely to run off favourably than adversely.
However, there can be no assurance that reserves will not develop adversely and exceed the Best Estimate.
In making its judgment of the Best Estimate of Reserves to include in the financial statements the Group Reserving Committee adopts the following approach: Royal & SunAlliance Annual Report & Accounts 2006 91 28.
Management of risks continued The Groups actuaries provide an indication of ultimate losses together with an assessment of risks and possible favourable or adverse developments that may not have been fully considered in calculating these indications.
At the end of 2006, these risks and developments included: the possibility of future legislative change having retrospective effect on open claims: changes in claims settlement procedures potentially leading to future claims payment patterns differing from historical experience: the possibility of new types of claim, such as disease claims, emerging from business written several years ago: general uncertainty in the claims environment: the emergence from latent exposures such as asbestos: the outcome of litigation on claims received: failure to recover reinsurance: and unanticipated changes in claims inflation, Consideration is also made of the views of internal peer reviewers of the reserves and of third parties including actuaries, legal counsel, risk directors, underwriters and claims managers, Consideration is made of how previous actuarial indications have developed.
In forming its collective judgment, the Committee will consider this information as a whole.
Estimation of claims provisions non asbestos reserves Reserves are analysed by line of business within the various regions.
A single line of business may be written in one or more of the regions.
Case reserves are established on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim.
Lines of business for which claims data eg paid claims and case reserves emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long tail lines of business.
Lines of business for which claims data emerge more quickly are referred to as short tail lines of business.
Within the Groups operations a typical short tail line of business is property.
The longest tail lines of business include personal accident in Scandinavia, workers compensation in the US, commercial liability and professional liability.
Our reserving managers regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claims data.
These reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgements and involve extensive analysis.
For most lines of business a variety of actuarial methods are reviewed and the reserving managers select methods and specific assumptions appropriate for each line of business based on the current circumstances affecting that line of business.
These selections incorporate input from claims personnel, underwriters and operating management on reported claims trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.
For short tail lines of business, development of paid claims and case reserves is reliable and indicative of ultimate losses.
The method used is based on the amount of paid and case estimates for reported claims.
For long tail lines of business, initial development of paid claims and case reserves is less reliable and, accordingly, may not be fully indicative of ultimate losses.
For this reason, within these lines, methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given less weight in calculating the reserves for the early stages of loss development.
The estimation of reserves for these lines of business in the early stages of claims development is therefore largely influenced by prior accident years loss ratios and changes to pricing, claims costs, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to affect the loss ratio.
For later periods of loss emergence, methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given more weight in estimating ultimate losses.
Based on the results of the reserve reviews and after consideration of other factors such as the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business, we determine the appropriate level of reserves to book.
The Group is a multi line, multi national property and casualty insurer.
It is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a number of conditions, including but not limited to those noted above, any of which could be material at any point in time for any line of business.
Certain issues may become more or less important over time as conditions change.
As various market conditions develop, we must assess whether those conditions constitute a long term trend that should result in a reserving action ie increasing or decreasing the reserve.
Estimation of claims provisions asbestos reserves The Group has exposure to liabilities for asbestos related losses arising from the sale of commercial liability and multi peril policies prior to 1987.
After 1987, policy wordings contained more prescriptive, and in many cases absolute, exclusions for these types of exposure thereby considerably reducing the potential for loss.
In the UK, asbestos liabilities have emerged most frequently in the employers liability line.
This coverage indemnifies individuals injured in the workplace.
The effect of reinsurance purchased against large individual losses is reduced by the often multi year nature of the liabilities which means a deductible for each year of exposure applies.
Reserving for asbestos claims is subject to a range of uncertainties that are generally greater than those presented by other types of claims.
These include long reporting delays, unresolved legal issues on policy coverage and the identity of the insureds.
As a consequence, traditional loss reserving techniques cannot wholly be relied on and we have employed specialised techniques to determine reserves in a prudent manner using the extensive knowledge of both internal asbestos experts and external legal and professional advisors.
Royal & SunAlliance 92 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 28.
Management of risks continued UK risks written in the UK The majority of business in this area is employers liability EL written through our UK Commercial business with a small amount of public and products liability.
The underlying method for the estimation of asbestos requirements for UK EL depends critically on establishing a model of all expected deaths from asbestos related disease, which is then adjusted to allow for the delay between claim and death of claimant.
Calibration of the resultant model to Group experience of reported claims allows an estimate of future numbers of claims against the Group to be produced.
Average claim cost is monitored from claim notifications over time and, from this data, after adjustment for inflation, a view is taken of current average claims cost taking into account evidence of trends etc.
The average costs observed will reflect the proportion of claims cost being borne by the Group as a result of current sharing agreements amongst insurers, which in turn reflects the Groups proportion of claimant exposure periods.
US risks written in the UK US asbestos exposure arises from a variety of sources including: London market direct business written through Marine operations many years ago, inward reinsurance exposures also written through the London market and from participation in UK aviation pools.
The position in the US is particularly problematic, as plaintiffs have expanded their focus to defendants beyond the traditional asbestos manufacturers and distributors.
This has arisen as a consequence of the increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection because of asbestos related litigation and the exhaustion of their policy limits.
Plaintiffs, supported by lawyers remunerated on a contingent fee basis, are now seeking to draw in a wide cross section of defendants who previously only had peripheral or secondary involvement in asbestos litigation.
This may include companies which have distributed or incorporated asbestos containing parts in their products or operated premises where asbestos was present.
There are also increasing signs of attempts to reopen and reclassify into other insurance coverages previously settled claims, and the filing of claims under the non aggregate premises or operation section of general liability policies.
There are also indications that plaintiffs may seek damages by asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos.
Emerging and legal risks These are risks that have been identified as potentially affecting the Group but for which the extent of risk has not yet been identified.
Existing or potential future risk exposures are investigated in a structured way, using internal and external resources, and appropriate proposals for actions to mitigate, contain or remove these risks are made to the BRC.
In addition, to the extent that legal decisions in any of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates worldwide may increase court awards, and that the impact may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, claims and benefits provisions may prove insufficient to cover actual losses, loss adjustment expenses or future policy benefits.
In such an event, or where it has been previously estimated that no liability would apply, the Group would add to its loss provisions and incur a charge to earnings.
Such insufficiencies could have a material adverse effect on the Groups future consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
In the ordinary course of its insurance activities, the Group is routinely involved in legal or arbitration proceedings with respect to liabilities which are the subject of policy claims.
As insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge.
These issues can have a negative effect on the Groups business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number and size of claims.
Aggregation of risks The Group is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural peril event such as a hurricane, flood or an earthquake, or man made catastrophes such as an explosion or fire at a major industrial facility.
Any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses under one or more of its policies.
The ability of the businesses in each territory to assess the aggregation risk of a single event impacting on thousands of policyholders is vital.
The Group employs proprietary exposure measurement systems to assess these risks.
In some markets, particularly in the UK, the Group has in addition, developed its own expertise in catastrophe modelling that is used in conjunction with outside consultants.
The accurate estimation of the potential expected maximum loss for a catastrophe is critical and is the primary factor considered in designing the Groups catastrophe reinsurance programme.
The expertise within the Group on catastrophe modelling is shared through the Worldwide Reinsurance Practice Group, which also provides an overview of the company wide catastrophe exposures and reinsurance adequacy.
A reinsurance programme is considered to be adequate only if it covers at least 199 out of 200 possible events by loss size.
This is referred to as the 1 in 200 year expected maximum loss.
Since 1999, the Group has set its total retention for a single catastrophic event based on geographic location.
The operations of the Group are responsible for buying reinsurance to protect their results against catastrophes and for determining their own retentions.
The Group Corporate Centre reviews the operations proposed catastrophe purchases to check that they at least meet the Groups 1 in 200 year standard.
Group Corporate Centre also checks to see that total Group exposures are within the limits set out above and also are consistent with the required risk based capital.
As a result, the Group may decide to purchase further catastrophe coverage at the Group level.
Royal & SunAlliance Annual Report & Accounts 2006 93 28.
Management of risks continued Reinsurance risk The Group reinsures a portion of the risks underwritten to control exposure to losses, to reduce volatility and protect capital.
The Groups reinsurance strategy is to purchase reinsurance in the most effective manner from reinsurers who meet its security standards.
The Group uses financial analysis models to assess the risk and reward effects of different reinsurance structures and prices.
The Group remains primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured, although the reinsurer is liable to the Group to the extent of the reinsurance ceded.
To limit the risk that the reinsurer is unable to pay in full, under certain reinsurance agreements the Group holds collateral, including escrow funds and letters of credit.
The Group monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis, and reviews its reinsurance arrangements regularly to ensure that its total counterparty exposure to individual reinsurance groups is within the limits set by the BRC and the Financial Services Authority for insurers domiciled in the UK.
In selecting the reinsurers with whom the Group does business, the Group uses the following principles: Its strategy is to seek reinsurers with the best combination of credit rating, price and capacity.
The Group publishes internally a list of authorised reinsurers who pass its security review process and which its operations may use for new transactions, The Group reviews the financial security of each of its reinsurers having regard to the work of rating agencies and specialist advice from other sources, such as the counterparty risk assessment units of its reinsurance brokers, As part of this review work, the Group assesses public ratings of its reinsurers.
Reinsurers that have a Financial Strength Rating of less than A with Standard & Poors, or a comparable rating with AM Best, are removed from the Groups authorised list unless the Groups own review discovers exceptional circumstances in favour of the reinsurer.
Further, if a rating agency reduces a reinsurers rating, the Group carries out its own review of that reinsurer to see whether it should remain on the list of authorised reinsurers, The BRC sets targets for the credit profile of reinsurers on the Groups treaty purchases, The Group limits the credit risk exposure to individual captive reinsurers, with whom it deals as part of the commercial lines business, by analysis of their finances and controlling the maximum exposure to each captive each time the reinsurance contract is renewed, The Group monitors changes in the financial security of all of its reinsurers to see whether their ability to pay recoverables in full is doubtful.
Where a reinsurers ability to pay in full is believed to be doubtful, the Group Corporate Centre sets guidelines for provisioning for uncollectible reinsurance.
These guidelines apply to all operations.
Group Corporate Centre analyses local provisions against the Groups guidelines.
Credit profile of Group reinsurance counterparties The table below sets forth the rating assigned by Standard & Poors to the Groups primary property and casualty treaty reinsurers and the amounts ceded to them under outward reinsurance contracts during 2006 and 2005.
This type of reinsurance requires the reinsurer to assume insurance risk, on a predetermined basis, for all of the contracts underwritten by the Group and that are covered by the treaty.
For each reinsurance group, the table shows the rating category of each reinsurance group as of 31 December 2006 together with the rating category of that reinsurance group as of 31 December 2005.
2006 2005 Ceded treaty S&P rating Ceded treaty S&P rating premiums at premiums at Reinsurance group m 31 December m 31 December HDI Group 66 AA- 56 AA Lloyds of London 64 A 44 A Munich Re Group 43 AA- 280 A Renaissance Re Holdings 25 A 37 A Swiss Re Group 50 AA- 37 AA The premiums ceded to Munich Re have reduced by 237m in 2006 primarily due to the cessation of the 100% health quota share arrangements.
During 2006, over 99% of the Groups property and casualty treaty cessions by premium were to reinsurers that had a Standard & Poors financial strength rating of at least A or better, or equivalent from AM Best, as at the start date of the contract.
The Groups property and casualty facultative placements, other than those with captive reinsurers of its major retail clients, are mainly with the same reinsurers used on treaty placements.
Facultative placements, or risks under facultative treaties, reinsure all or part of a single policy determined on a contract by contract basis.
As of 31 December 2006, total impairment provisions for uncollectable reinsurance was 61m 2005: 141m.
Certain of the Groups subsidiaries are members of government mandated pools in various parts of the world.
As of 31 December 2006, the largest pool by premium volume was Pool Re operated by the UK Government to provide terrorism cover.
Royal & SunAlliance 94 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 28.
Management of risks continued Credit risk The BRC is responsible for ensuring that the Board approved Group credit risk appetite is not exceeded.
In defining its risk appetite, the Group draws a distinction between credit risks incurred as a result of offsetting insurance risks or operating in the insurance market eg reinsurance credit risks and insurance operations credit risks for which risk tolerances and target profiles are identified and credit risks incurred for the purposes of generating a return eg invested assets credit risk for which strict exposure limits are set.
The Group controls its credit exposures according to a series of Group credit risk policies that reflects the individual considerations of the risk categories.
These policies are supported by a series of procedures eg counterparty assessment processes and limits eg investment and bank counterparty limits, which are designed to ensure that the Groups risk appetite is not exceeded.
Reinsurance counterparties are subject to a rigorous internal assessment process on an ongoing basis to ensure that their creditworthiness continues to be satisfactory.
Collateral is taken to mitigate exposures where appropriate to the size or credit quality of the exposure.
Further discussion on credit risk arising from reinsurance ceded is discussed within the section on reinsurance risk.
Insurance operations credit risks are incurred on a devolved basis with regional operations undertaking the responsibility for assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of their counterparties eg brokers and policyholders.
Local credit committees are responsible for ensuring these exposures are within the risk appetite of the local operations within the overall financial control framework.
Exposure monitoring and reporting is embedded throughout the organisation with aggregate credit positions reported at Group level.
Invested assets credit risk is discussed in more detail below.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk can be set out as follows: 2006 2005 Maximum Maximum credit risk credit risk carrying value carrying value m m Cash and cash equivalents 1,831 1,617 Debt securities 8,568 11,609 Other financial assets 155 146 Short term investments 114 95 Derivative assets 17 31 Insurance debtors 1,996 1,978 Reinsurance debtors 229 569 Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities 1,927 4,406 Royal & SunAlliance Annual Report & Accounts 2006 95 28.

The mix of investments and their carrying values which include fixed maturities and equity securities is set out below.
Analysis of debt securities The credit profile of the Groups fixed income portfolios reflects the Groups commitment to matching its liabilities with investment rated liquid instruments for the protection of the policyholder.

The investment risk policy governs the Groups exposure to market risks.
Exposures are controlled by the setting of investment limits in line with the Groups risk appetite.
The Group Investment Committee GIC, on behalf of the Group Board, is responsible for reviewing and approving the investment strategy for the Groups investment portfolios.
It provides approval for all major changes of the Groups investment strategy and, in particular, approves any substantive changes to the balance of the Groups funds between the major asset classes.
Importantly the GIC also approves the terms of reference of the Groups main operational investment committee, the Group Asset Management Committee GAMC.
The BRC issues GAMC with risk limits.
Interest rate risk The fair value of the Groups portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates.
Thus if interest rates fall the fair value of the portfolio would tend to rise and vice versa as set out in the sensitivity analysis.
Equity price risk The Groups portfolio of equity securities is subject to equity risk arising from changes in market price.
Thus if the value of equities rise so will the fair value of its portfolio and vice versa as set out in the sensitivity analysis.
Royal & SunAlliance 98 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 28.
Management of risks continued The Group sets appropriate risk limits to ensure that no significant concentrations to individual companies or sectors arise.
The Group takes a long term view in selecting stocks and looks to build value over a sustained period of time rather than churning the portfolio looking for short term gains from its equity holdings.
The Group makes use of derivative products as appropriate to protect the portfolio from losses outside of its risk appetite.
The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equities.
Property price risk The Groups portfolio of properties is subject to property price risk arising from changes in the market value of properties.
Thus if the value of property falls so will the fair value of the portfolio as set out in the sensitivity analysis.
A number of the Groups property holdings are Group occupied and therefore appear as property and equipment within the reported accounts.
The Groups investment in investment property is recorded as such and is invested in as part of an efficient portfolio management strategy.
Foreign currency exchange risk The Group operates in 27 countries.
Accordingly, its net assets are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
The Groups primary foreign currency exposures are to the US$, Canadian$, Danish kroner, Swedish krona and Euro.
If the value of the British Pound strengthens then the value of non British Pound net assets will decline when translated into British Pounds and consolidated.
The Group incurs exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in two ways: Operational foreign currency exchange risk by underwriting liabilities in currencies other than the currency of the primary environment in which the business units operate non functional currencies, Structural foreign currency exchange risk by investing in overseas subsidiaries and operating an international insurance group.
Operational foreign currency exchange risk is managed within the Groups individual operations by broadly matching assets and liabilities by currency.
Structural foreign currency exchange risk is managed at a Group level.
In managing structural foreign currency exchange risk net assets maintained by the Groups subsidiaries in local currencies are taken into account to satisfy local regulatory solvency and internal risk based capital assessment requirements.
These assets should prove adequate to support local insurance activities irrespective of foreign currency exchange rate movements.
Consequently, this may affect the value of the consolidated shareholders equity expressed in pounds sterling.
Derivatives The Group may use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk.
The Group does not use derivatives to leverage its exposure to markets and does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Forward contracts are used to reduce the risk of adverse currency movements on certain forecast future cash transactions.
The policy on use of derivatives is approved by BRC.
While these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in value of the underlying exposures.
Derivatives are generally held until their maturity date.

Management of risks continued At 31 December 2006, there were derivative contracts in place to protect the value of the UK equity portfolios of the Group.
These provided limited protection against declines in market levels whilst also capping participation in any appreciation of the market.
In total, this strategy covered an underlying equity value of approximately 800m.
The impact of these derivatives as of 31 December 2006 if world equity markets decreased by 15% would be to decrease the impact of the decline by 41m 2005: 18m.

This analysis assumes that there is no correlation between equity price, interest rate, property market and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
It also assumes that all other assets and liabilities remain unchanged and that no management action is taken.
This analysis does not represent managements view of future market change.
The sensitivity of the bond assets of the Group has been modelled by reference to a reasonable approximation of the average interest rate sensitivity of the investments held within each of the portfolios.
The effect of movements in equity and property markets is reflected as a one time decrease of worldwide equity and property markets on 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2006 which results in a 15% decline in the value of the Groups assets in these investment categories.
The effect of currency movements on investments is reflected as a one time decrease in the value of major currencies against the British pound on 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2006.
This analysis has not considered the impact of the above market changes on the valuation of the Groups insurance liabilities.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available to pay obligations when due at a reasonable cost.
The Group has no appetite for incurring liquidity risk and is committed to meeting all liabilities as they fall due.
The investment limits ensure the Groups portfolio is kept in highly liquid marketable securities sufficient to meet its liabilities as they come due based on actuarial assessment.
The limits are monitored at a Group level as part of the Group Risk exposure monitoring and BRC reporting process.
In addition, the Group has committed credit facilities available as set out in note 22.
Hedge accounting At 1 January 2005, the Group designated the loan capital denominated in foreign currencies as hedging instruments against the net investment in designated subsidiaries to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk exposure.
The book value of the hedging instruments at 31 December 2006 was 335m 2005: 626m.
The fair value of the hedging instruments at 31 December 2006 was 353m 2005: 735m.

Discontinued operations, non current assets and assets and liabilities of operations held for sale Discontinued operations On 28 September, the Group announced the sale of its US operations to Arrowpoint Capital Corp. Arrowpoint, a company set up by the US management team.
The Group is selling its US operation to Arrowpoint for a deferred consideration of 158m $300m, which will be funded from the future performance of the US operation.
The Group will make a 151m $287.5m capital contribution into the US regulated entities.
Two existing arrangements will remain in place: the Adverse Development Cover ADC and the Letter of Credit LOC supporting certain third party reinsurance recoverables and agreed pension contributions.
The ADC is a reinsurance cover put in place in 2003.
It is at its policy limit and only exposed to timing risk.
The prudent assumptions supporting the projected payment patterns give additional cover against potential timing risks for payment of claims.
For the LOC of 79m a methodology has been agreed to step it down commencing two years after the completion of the transaction conditional on the financial health of the US regulated entities.
In the event that the regulated entities are required to draw down on the LOC, a mechanism has been agreed for reimbursement to the Group.
Neither the ADC nor the LOC represent new exposures to the Group and the directors believe that they do not represent material risks to the Group given their nature, timing and likelihood.
As part of the disposal the Group has given minimal representations and warranties and the transaction represents a clean exit from the US.
It is intended that the present value of the deferred consideration will be held as part of the general investment portfolio of the Group.
The loss recognised as a result of remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell is 399m.
On 4 March 2007, the Group announced the completion of the disposal of its US operations to Arrowpoint.
The disposal will be recognised in the Groups financial statements for 2007.
