Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of different jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the appropriate provision for transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
In such circumstances, the Group recognises liabilities for anticipated taxes due based on best information available.
Where the final outcome of such matters differs from the amounts initially recorded, any differences will impact the tax and deferred tax provisions in the period to which such determination is made.
1.19 New accounting standards and interpretations During the period, the following new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards were published, but do not become effective until future accounting periods: IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Amendment : Financial Guarantee Contracts.
This amendment stipulates certain measurement criteria for issued financial guarantees not classified as insurance contracts.
It requires the guarantees to be initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of: a the unamortised balance of the related fees received and deferred, and b the expenditure required to settle the commitment at the balance sheet date.
The Group has yet to determine the impact of this amendment.
The Group will apply this amendment from 30 April 2006: and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and a complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures.
IFRS 7 replaces IAS 32 and introduces new disclosures to increase information provided about financial instruments including additional disclosures about exposure to risks including sensitivity analysis.
The Group will apply IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 from 29 April 2007.
