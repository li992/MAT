17 Risk management In pursuing the investment objectives set out on page 1 of this Report the Company holds a number of financial instruments.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and policies: Cash and liquid resources that arise directly from its operations: and Shareholders funds, representing investors monies, which are invested on their behalf.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price, foreign currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks.
The Investment Manager reviews policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainties about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Directors meet quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors whilst continuing to follow the investment objectives.
The Investment Manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet the risk reward profile that is acceptable.
The Investment Manager does not use derivative instruments to hedge the investment portfolio against market risk, as in its opinion, the cost of such a process would result in an unacceptable reduction in the potential for capital growth.
Foreign currency risk Currency translation movements can significantly affect the income and capital value of the Companys investments as the majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
53 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 17 Risk management continued The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movements, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date on which it is settled.
The Company receives income in currencies other than sterling and the sterling values of this income can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Company converts all receipts of income into sterling on or near the date of receipt: it, however, does not hedge or otherwise seek to avoid rate movement risk on income accrued but not received.
Interest rate risk The Company is permitted to invest in fixed rate securities.
Any change to the interest rates relevant to particular securities may result in either income increasing or decreasing, or the Manager being unable to secure similar returns on the expiry of contracts or the sale of securities.
In addition, changes to prevailing rates or changes in expectations of future rates may result in an increase or decrease in the value of the securities held.
In general, if interest rates rise the income potential of the Company also rises, but the value of fixed rate securities will decline.
A decline in interest rates will have the opposite effect.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly of securities listed on the stock exchanges of emerging economies.
Liquidity can vary from market to market and some securities may take longer to sell.
As a closed ended investment trust, liquidity risks attributable to the Company are less significant than for an open-ended fund.
Securities held by the Company are valued at Bid price.
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Credit risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the investment purchase or cash in relation to sale or declared dividend after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
The Company only buys and sells through brokers which have been approved by the Investment Manager as an acceptable counter-party.
In addition, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any individual broker that may exist at any time.
These limits are reviewed regularly.
The amount of credit risk that the Company is exposed to is disclosed under Interest Rate Risk Profile.
Fair Value Fair values are derived as follows: Where assets are denominated in a foreign currency, they are converted into the Sterling amount using year-end rates of exchange.
Non-current financial assets on the basis set out in the accounting policies.
Cash at the face value of the account.
