j Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including 30 September 2005, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These financial statements are the first that the Group is required to prepare under IFRS.
In preparing financial statements under IFRS, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 October 2004, the Companys transition date, and made changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the adjustments made in restating easyJets UK GAAP balance sheet at the transition date and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2005.
Where a parent company issues options over its shares to employees of a subsidiary company, IFRS 2 requires the parent to show a capital contribution to the subsidiary for the cost of providing share options to the subsidiarys employees.
The contribution is calculated as the fair value of the award on the date of grant, and is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme.
A binomial model has been used to calculate the fair value of options on their grant date.
easyJet has applied the provisions of IFRS 2 only to awards made after 7 November 2002, an exemption allowed on transition by IFRS 1.
This has no impact on the income statement of easyJet plc.
Restatements of equity from UK GAAP to IFRS for the Company were as follows: 30 September 1 October 2005 2004 million million Shareholders funds equity UK GAAP 656.9 651.6 Adoption of IFRS 2 4.0 2.1 Shareholders funds equity IFRS 660.9 653.7 106 Annual report and accounts 2006
