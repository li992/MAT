Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with current International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of Michael Page International plc consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been included as part of these accounts.
The Companys profit for the financial year amounted to 6.7m 2005: 11.1m.
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Change in accounting policy and prior year restatement The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust were previously reported within the company only balance sheet: in accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities the accounting policy has been amended such that these assets and liabilities are recorded only within the consolidated balance sheet of the Group.
The prior year comparatives for the company only balance sheet have been restated accordingly.
This has had an effect of increasing net assets in the company only balance sheet at 31 December 2005 by 6.1m with no impact on profit.
The net assets, profit and cashflows of the Group are unaffected by this adjustment.
With the exception of the change in policy referred to above, the remaining policies, set out below, have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
a Turnover and income recognition Turnover, which excludes value added tax VAT, constitutes the value of services undertaken by the Group as its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services.
These consist of: turnover from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff including the salary cost of these staff.
This is recognised when the service has been provided: turnover from permanent placements, which is based on a percentage of the candidates remuneration package, and is derived from both retained assignments income recognised on completion of defined stages of work and non-retained assignments income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate, and where a start date has been determined.
The latter includes turnover anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within prepayments and accrued income.
A provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment: and turnover from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf principally advertisements is recognised when the expense is incurred.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
b Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.
3 MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued c Gross profit Gross profit is represented by turnover less cost of sales and consists of the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and the margin on advertising income.
d Foreign currency translation i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
e Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy h. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
ii Computer software Computer software acquired by the Group is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below.
iii Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life.
Computer software is amortised at 20% per annum.
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 is 311.7m 2005: 311.7m.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates: Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter Furniture, fixtures and equipment 10-20% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum g Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Significant accounting policies continued h Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less impairment losses.
j Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis k Pension costs The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension costs charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.
l Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to profit or loss.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classed as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued m Segment reporting The consolidated entity operates in one business segment being that of recruitment services primary segment.
As a result no additional business segment information is required to be provided.
The consolidated entity operates in four geographic segments secondary segment, the United Kingdom, EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Americas.
n Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
o Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
Their subsequent accounting treatments are described below: i Share option schemes The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings per share.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable is revised.
The Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and the corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
ii Deferred Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plans Where deferred awards are made to Directors and senior executives under either the Incentive Share Plan or the Annual Bonus Scheme, to reflect that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value of the expected award is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to which the award relates.
p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash-in-hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
q Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
r Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
s Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
t Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are accrued in the income statement on a time basis.
u Financial instruments: recognition and measurement The Group has no derivative contracts at the balance sheet date and therefore the requirements of the recognition criteria under IAS 39 are not relevant to the Group.
Significant accounting policies continued v Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management anticipate that any estimates and judgements made do not have a material effect on the results.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes: Note 1 revenue recognition Note 17 utilisation of tax losses Note 18 measurement of share-based payments w New standards and interpretations not yet adopted At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures when the relevant Standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Segment reporting The consolidated entity operates in one business segment, being that of recruitment services, and this is the Groups primary segment.
As a result, no additional business segment information is required to be provided.
The Groups secondary segment is geography.

The comparative final dividend at 31 December 2005 was also not recognised as a liability in the prior year.
The proposed final dividend of 4.2p 2005: 3.5p per ordinary share will be paid on 5 June 2007 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 4 May 2007, subject to approval by shareholders.
When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.. Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2006 2005 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 65,447 49,630 Number of shares Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 334,744 336,283 Dilution effect of share plans 000 8,888 9,014 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 343,632 345,297 Basic earnings per share pence 19.6 14.8 Diluted earnings per share pence 19.0 14.4 The above results relate to continuing operations.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held in the EBT reserve.
61 MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS.
Earnings per ordinary share continued Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.
Potential future ordinary share transactions It remains the Companys intention to use surplus cash to repurchase and cancel its shares.

The terminal value of the cash flow is then calculated by discounting using the Groups weighted average cost of capital 8%.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2006 there was no impairment of intangible assets.

At 31 December 2006, the Group had available 10.2m 2005: 44.8m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The average interest rates paid were as follows: 31 December 31 December 2006 2005 Bank overdrafts 4.26% 5.63% Bank loans 5.40% 5.46% Interest rate risk The exposure to interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group does not consider this risk as significant.
The benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
Currency rate risk An explanation of the Groups treasury policy is included in the Finance Directors review on page 25.

Deferred tax continued At 31 December 2006, unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies amounted to 40.2m 2005: 17.6m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas and UK tax after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
However, no tax is expected to be payable on them.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 0.8m 2005: 0.5m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
All of the deferred tax asset for losses of 3,114,000 is dependent on arising future taxable profits.
Of the recognised deferred tax asset, 3,068,000 is recognised within territories that were loss making in the current year.
These losses have been recognised given managements expectations for the businesses to which they relate for 2007 and the occurrence of one-off costs within 2006 that are not expected to re-occur.
Called-up share capital 2006 2005 Number of Number of 000 shares 000 shares Authorised Ordinary shares of 1p each 5,713 571,250,000 5,713 571,250,000 Allotted, called-up and fully paid At 1 January 3,326 332,637,799 3,572 357,202,799 Shares issued 238 23,874,277 Cancellation of own shares 232 23,270,000 246 24,565,000 At 31 December 3,332 333,242,076 3,326 332,637,799 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Group has an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to receive shares in the entity.
In accordance with these programmes, options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of the grant.
Two grants under the ESOS were made before 7 November 2002.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002.
They have not been applied to the two grants made prior to 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
At 31 December 2006 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the Companys ordinary shares of 1p under the Michael Page Executive Share Option Scheme.
All options granted are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Called-up share capital continued Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Balance at No.
In 2006, options were granted on 7 March with the estimated fair values of the options granted on that day of 3.10.
In 2005, options were granted on 28 February.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on that date was 1.91.
Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions.
These conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants other than those on the initial grant in 2001.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2006 have an exercise price in the range of 81.5 pence to 309.9 pence and a weighted average contractual life of 6.3 years.
The fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Scheme Incentive Share Scheme Deferred Bonus Shares 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Share price 3.10 1.91 3.10 1.93 3.10 1.93 Average exercise price 3.10 1.91 Nil Nil Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 3.10 1.91 3.10 1.93 3.10 1.93 Expected volatility 35% 35% 35% 35% 35% 35% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 4.75% 4.75% 4.75% 4.75% 4.75% 4.75% Expected dividend yield 1.5% 2% Nil Nil Nil Nil Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price since flotation.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Group recognised total expenses of 4.5m 2005: 2.7m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Called-up share capital continued Option plan details Note 1 Pre flotation options On flotation, options over 33,750,000 9% ordinary shares were granted to the Executive Directors and 427 employees.
These options are subject to the following: a 55.6% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that Earnings Per Share EPS targets have been satisfied over a period of 3 to 10 years.
None of these options will vest unless EPS has grown in line with the UK Retail Prices Index RPI plus an average of 5% per annum.
At that point one third of this portion of the options vest.
If EPS growth is higher than this level, vesting increases on a sliding scale basis until 100% of this portion of the options vest where EPS growth matches RPI plus an average of 10% per annum.
The base earnings per share is 9.9p.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2005 met the EPS performance conditions for 85% of the outstanding options.
The result for the year ended 31 December 2006 met the EPS performance conditions for the remaining 15% of the outstanding options, these will vest on 1 March 2007. b 44.4% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that share price growth targets have been satisfied over a period of at least 3 years.
None of these options will vest unless the Companys share price has achieved 50% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
Vesting then increases progressively for further share price growth until full vesting occurs where there is 200% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
These hurdles rise from the fifth anniversary of the date of grant at compound rates of growth of 8.45% and 24.57% respectively.
At 31 December 2006, the performance conditions were met for 62.4% 2005: 33.7% of the outstanding share price dependent options.
Note 2 Grants post flotation The respective base earnings per share for each grant are shown in the table on page 69.
For the 2004, 2005 and 2006 grants, the performance condition is tested on the third anniversary and no retesting will occur thereafter.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index.
All future grants of options under this scheme will be subject to similar EPS performance conditions which is considered the best measure of the Groups performance and is designed to provide a direct link between the rewards for executives and the returns to shareholders, whilst at the same time ensuring that senior executives can measure the results of their efforts through the Companys share price.
Other share-based payment plans The Company also operates an Incentive Share Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and an Annual Bonus Plan for the Executive Directors.
Details of these schemes are disclosed on pages 39 and 40, and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
Reserves Share premium The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.
The increase in the year represents the nominal value of the 23,270,000 shares cancelled during the year as shown in Note 18.
Reserve for own shares At 31 December 2006, the EBT reserve consisted of 5,552,237 2005: 5,640,715 ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust representing 1.67% of the called-up share capital with a market value of 14.7m 2005: 15.2m.
A total of 1,805,754 shares have been allocated to satisfy awards made under the Incentive Share Plan, and 575,820 deferred shares have been allocated under the Annual Bonus Plan.
Dividends are paid on these shares and they are included in the EPS calculation.
Dividend income on the remaining 3,259,141 ordinary shares has been waived, and they are excluded from the EPS calculation.
Currency translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations that are integral to the operations of the Company.
