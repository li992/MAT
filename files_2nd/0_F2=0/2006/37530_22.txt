Notes forming part of the financial statements a Accounting policies The Company financial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP, rather than under IFRS which has been adopted for Group reporting.
UK GAAP is converging towards IFRS and a number of new Financial Reporting Standards became applicable for the first time in the year.
The accounting policies relevant to the Company are consistent with those set out in the Group accounting policies in note 1.
The new UK accounting standards are: FRS 17 Retirement benefits applicable for the first time FRS 20 Share-based payments FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement The Company financial statements have been restated for the year ended 31 March 2005 to reflect the retrospective application of these new standards.
The impact of FRS 20 on the comparative figures is a charge to the profit and loss account of 0.2 million, less associated deferred tax of 0.1 million, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The impact of FRS 21 on the comparative figures is to exclude the proposed final dividend of 14.8 million from the balance sheet and income statement and include the final dividend of 10.7 million relating to the year ended 31 March 2004, resulting in a net increase in Shareholders funds of 4.1 million.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules, except for investment properties and investment in subsidiaries which are stated at their fair value.
Under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.
Net rental income Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Rent increases arising from rent reviews are taken into account when such reviews have been settled with tenants.
Investment properties In accordance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties, investment properties are revalued annually at open market value determined in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
Revaluation surpluses and temporary deficits are included in the revaluation reserve, permanent deficits being taken through the profit and loss account.
No depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years to run.
This treatment, which is in accordance with SSAP 19, may be a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the financial statements to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
On disposal of an investment property the element of tax relating to the profit in the year is charged to the profit and loss account and the element relating to earlier revaluation surpluses is included in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts and their recognition in a tax computation.
In accordance with FRS 19 Deferred Tax, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on the sale has been recognised in the accounts.
84 London Merchant Securities plc a Accounting policies continued Subsidiary undertakings valuation The Companys investments in the shares of Group undertakings are stated at directors valuation on a basis which takes account of the net assets of the undertakings at 31 March 2006 which will include the professional valuation of properties.
Surpluses and temporary deficits arising from the directors valuation are taken to revaluation reserve in the Company balance sheet, permanent diminutions in value are taken to the Company profit and loss account.
Financial guarantees The Company has not adopted amendments to FRS 26 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 April 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 April 2006. b Tangible fixed assets Freehold Freehold 2006 2005 000 000 Investment Properties Valuation At 1 April 375 23,875 Surplus on revaluation 1,800 Disposal transfer 23,500 At 31 March 2,175 375 Historical cost of revalued assets At 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005 39 38 The investment properties have been independently valued by CB Richard Ellis, Chartered Surveyors, of London as at 31 March 2006 on the basis of Market Value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
