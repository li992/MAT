The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations, which have not been included in the following disclosures.
The only derivative financial instruments that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate, liquidity and credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing all of these risks and these are summarised below.
The Group has no material exposure to currency rate risk.
Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, securitised debt and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups aim is to reduce the risk of exposure to market rate fluctuations in the medium term.
Liquidity risk: The Groups policy is to ensure continuity of funding and in particular to ensure that funding requirements for the medium term are available through committed facilities.
In addition, having regard to the longevity of the Groups assets, securitised debt is considered as being a suitable debt instrument.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities and other uncommitted facilities.
Credit risk: The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.

All other fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
As explained in the accounting policies, IAS 39 has not been applied in valuing the derivative financial instrument in the comparative balance sheet.
This is instead recorded at cost.
The table above shows the fair values that would have been recognised if IAS 39 had been adopted for the comparative period.
The 0.9m derivative financial instrument included in the comparative balance sheet under non-current liabilities represents the fair value of a swap instrument acquired with the Jennings business during 2005.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate payable on the floating rate tranches of its securitised debt.
These derivative financial instruments have qualified for cash flow hedge accounting as defined in IAS 39, and, as a result, changes in fair value are recognised in equity for the effective portion of the hedge.
The gains on cash flow hedges taken directly to equity in the period totalled 0.3m.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 30 September 2006 was 225.9m 2005: 236.0m.
The interest rate swap fixes interest at 4.9%.
The interest rate risk profile, after taking account of derivative financial instruments, is as follows: 2006 2005 Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m m Borrowings 183.3 795.3 978.6 156.8 805.5 962.3 The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial borrowings is 5.3% 2005: 5.3% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 13 years 2005: 14 years.
Maturity of borrowings The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the Groups borrowings at the period-end is as follows: 2006 2005 GrossUnamortised Net Gross Unamortised Net borrowings issue costs borrowings borrowings issue costs borrowings m m m m m m Due within one year 39.8 1.2 38.6 55.0 1.2 53.8 In more than one year but less than two years 11.5 1.2 10.3 11.5 1.2 10.3 In more than two years but less than five years 196.1 3.2 192.9 150.4 3.5 146.9 In more than five years 731.2 7.7 723.5 745.4 8.5 736.9 978.6 13.3 965.3 962.3 14.4 947.9 Included within the above table are finance leases of 0.3m 2005: 0.4m.
