The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production UOP method by reference to the ratio of production in the period and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit of throughput basis.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial statements 2 Loss for the year 71 As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
Premier Oil plc reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 of US$29.7 million 2005: loss of US$3.6 million.
The auditors remuneration for audit services to the company was US$10,000 2005: US$10,000.

Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
During the year the company acquired a 40 per cent interest in the Kyle field from Premier Pict Petroleum Limited for a consideration of US$70.0 million.

The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred between 2007 and 2014.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
9 Pension liability 2006 2005 $ million $ million UK funded pension scheme 3.4 7.0 UK unfunded pension scheme 1.0 0.9 Liability in balance sheet 4.4 7.9 The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Parent company financial statements: Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 74 9 Pension liability continued The pension cost for the Scheme is determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2005 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 6.5 per cent pa, salary growth: 4.8 per cent pa and pensions increases: 2.8 per cent pa.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 9.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted, the assets covered 93 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
During 2006, the employer contributed to the Scheme at a rate of 19 per cent of pensionable salaries together with 317,000 paid in monthly instalments: in addition, the employer paid a lump sum contribution of 1,220,000 in March 2006.
Aside from any further lump sum contribution, the employer expects to contribute 416,000 to the Scheme in 2007.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 Employee Benefits incorporating the amendment announced in December 2006 by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2006 but taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2007.
The benefit obligations and service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal financial assumptions adopted for this actuarial valuation were: % Rate of investment return 6.5% pa Rate of salary increases 4.8% pa Rate of pension increases 2.8% pa Employee benefit obligations: The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2006 2005 $ million $ million Present value of funded obligations 31.4 28.1 Fair value of Scheme assets 28.0 21.1 Deficit before allowing for deferred taxation 3.4 7.0 The amounts recognised in the profit and loss are as follows: 2006 2005 $ million $ million Current service cost 0.4 0.3 Interest on obligation 1.4 1.3 Expected return on Scheme assets 1.3 1.1 Total 0.5 0.5 Actual return on Scheme assets 1.5 2.7 A total of US$1.5 million 2005: US$2.4 million was recognised directly in equity during the year.

As at 31 December 2006, a 1 per cent point change in the assumption would have had the following effects on the closing defined benefit obligations: Discount rate: 5.2% pa as used for report Discount rate: 4.2% pa Discount rate: 6.2% pa Defined benefit obligation US$31.4 million US$38.2 million US$26.3 million 5 year historic record: 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Defined benefit obligation 31.4 28.1 25.1 20.9 17.4 Fair value of Scheme assets 28.0 21.1 18.9 16.2 13.1 Deficit in the Scheme 3.4 7.0 6.2 4.7 4.3 Experience adjustments on Scheme liabilities 0.6 0.1 0.7 1.5 0.5 Experience adjustments on Scheme assets 0.2 1.6 0.2 0.8 1.8 Unfunded benefit schemes In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2006 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of unfunded pensions is US$1.0 million 2005: US$0.9 million.
A total of US$0.1 million 2005: US$0.2 million was recognised directly in equity during the year.

No shares have yet been issued in relation to the Asset and Equity Plan.
Share option plans The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the companys shares have been granted to certain executives and employees.
Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will lapse on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Save As You Earn scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares purchased with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
The company made an award of Free Shares to each employee on 8 February 2002.

The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The company recognised total expenses of US$3.0 million and US$2.9 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2006 and 2005 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan The company currently operates an Asset and Equity Plan to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period.
The plan has two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 28 to 37.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility 29.0% to 34.0% Risk free rate on interest 4.1% to 5.0% Historic market value growth factor 91.0% to 233.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the total cost recognised by the company for share-based payments is US$17.5 million 2005: US$5.8 million, with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$18.3 million 2005: US$2.9 million and a cost of US$5.0 million recorded in equity 2005: US$2.9 million.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the timewriting system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as projects directly attributable to capital and part is charged to the income statement as exploration write off, operating costs, pre-licence expenditure or general and administration costs.
Non-Voting Convertible Shares The rights and restrictions attached to the Non-Voting Convertible Shares, none of which are currently issued, are as follows: Dividend rights The rights of the holders of Non-Voting Convertible Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with the rights of the Ordinary Shares in relation to dividends.
Winding up or reduction of capital On return of capital on a winding up or otherwise other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares the rights of the holders of the Non-Voting Convertible Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets of the company available for distribution, shall rank pari passu in all respects with the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares.
Voting rights The holders of Non-Voting Convertible Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, but not to attend, vote or speak at, any General Meeting of the company.
