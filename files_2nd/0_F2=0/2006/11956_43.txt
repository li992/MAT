29 Deferred Income The group entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement in December 2006 with its joint venture company PPH0 Limited, in which a number of properties were disposed of generating total proceeds of 250.1m.
The arrangement entitles PPH0 Limited to lease back those properties to the group over a period of over 25 years, a factor resulting in the group receiving a consideration in excess of the deemed fair value as at the date of disposal, when measured under an open market valuation in accordance with IFRS.
The proceeds received were estimated to be greater than the fair value of the properties by 22.0m and as required by IAS 17 'Leases' this excess over fair value is deferred and amortised over the period of the leases.
Of the remaining profit on disposal of the properties of 37.3m before costs, 18.3m was allocated to realised profit and 19.0m to investment in joint ventures, being the unrealised element.
