Additional information for US reporting 52 Suspended exploration well costs Included within the total exploration expenditure of $4,110 million 2005 $4,008 million and 2004 $3,761 million shown as part of intangible assets see Note 28 is an amount of $1,863 million 2005 $1,931 million and 2004 $1,680 million representing costs directly associated with exploration wells.
The carried costs of exploration wells are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery.
In evaluating whether costs incurred meet the criteria for initial and continued capitalization management uses two main criteria: a that exploration drilling is still under way or rmly planned, or b that it either has been determined, or work is underway to determine, that the discovery is economically viable, based on a range of technical and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing.
The following table provides the year-end balances and movements for suspended exploration well costs.
The table above shows a total of 48 projects which have exploration well costs which have been capitalized for more than twelve months as at 31 December 2006.
Of these, there are 21 projects where exploratory wells have been drilled in the preceding 12 months or further exploratory drilling is planned in the next year.
Projects with completed exploration activity comprise a total of 27 projects, whose costs totalled $781 million at 31 December 2006.
Details of the activities being undertaken to progress these projects towards development are shown below.

In Egypt, further exploratory drilling was undertaken in 2006 on the Temsah project, and $8 million relating to part of the project was sanctioned in 2006.
In Angola, the Bavuca Kakocha Mavacola Mbulumbumba Vicango project was regrouped into two separate projects, with one project planning further exploratory drilling in 2007 and an appraisal well having been drilled on the other in 2006.
In the US, the Point Thompson Sourdough project was written off resulting in an expense of $27million in respect of the well costs.
