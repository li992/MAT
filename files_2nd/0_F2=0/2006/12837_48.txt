29 Share-based payments The company operates a share option scheme for senior executives.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the companys shares on the dealing day before the option is granted.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group for any reason outside of the scheme rules.
Options under the scheme are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years from the date of grant and are subject to performance conditions.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model according to the relevant measures of performance.
The model includes adjustments, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural considerations and expected dividend payments.
The option life is derived by the models based on these assumptions and other assumptions identied below.
The total expense included within operating profit in respect of share-based payments was 0.4 million 2005: 0.3 million.
For those share option awards which gave rise to an expense in the year ended 31st May 2006, the assumptions used in the calculation of the fair values were as follows: Year to Year to 31st May 31st May 2006 2005 Vesting period 3yrs 3yrs Expected volatility 26.0% 25.7% Expected option life after anticipated lapses 3yrs 3yrs Risk-free rate 3% 3% Expected dividend yield 2.68% 2.68% Fair value per share p 68.8 64.5 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price over the previous two years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The dividend yield for 2005 was used for 2006 as the dividend for 2006 had not been approved at the AGM at the time the accounts were published.
