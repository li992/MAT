Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2006 75 22.
DEFERRED TAXATION Continued i As permitted by the transition provisions of IFRS 1, the Group has adopted IAS 39 from 1 April 2005.
As a result, the associated deferred taxation on the financial instruments recognised is highlighted in this note.
ii Includes movement relating to the Scotia Gas Networks plc swap from 1 April 2005 to 31 May 2005 note 14. iii Being transfer of deferred tax asset relating to financing derivatives at 1 June 2005 on completion of acquisition of gas distribution networks.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: Consolidated Company 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities 919.1 888.3 24.9 28.3 Deferred tax assets 86.0 97.9 Net deferred tax liabilities 833.1 790.4 24.9 28.3 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 40.6m 2005 40.9m available for offset against future profits.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 2.3m 2005 2.5m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled entities are recorded as part of the Groups share of investment in those entities.
The aggregate amount of these is 11.1m 2005 1.3m.

These losses will be incurred over a maximum period to 2011 when the contracts terminate.
ii Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning certain generation and gas storage assets.
The estimate is based on a forecast of clean-up costs at the time of decommissioning discounted for the time value of money.
The timing of costs provided is dependent on the lives of the facilities.
The provision held in respect of the decommissioning assets at Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge has been reassessed following the Groups decision to invest in flue gas desulphurisation plant at these stations, which is expected to extend the useful lives of the stations by between 15 and 20 years.
Accordingly, this change in the timing of the expected decommissioning expenditure has been reflected in the carrying value of the provision.
iii Other provisions include balances held in relation to restructuring, insurance and warranty claims.
In addition, the Group has an unapproved, unfunded retirement benefit provision for pensions for certain directors and former directors and employees.
The Company does not hold provisions.
