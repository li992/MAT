The use of such derivative financial instruments constitutes an integral part of the Companys funding strategy.
The Company manages its derivative financial instrument credit risk by only undertaking transactions with relationship banks holding good credit ratings.
Such transactions are governed by Board policies and procedures.
As all the Companys operations are transacted in the reporting currency, there is no currency exposure.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures as their fair value at the year end approximates their carrying value.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Company finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The principal area of financial risk is interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk on borrowings is managed by using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
A INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The interest rate exposure of the Companys financial assets was as follows: Floating rate weighted Fixed rate Floating rate Total average m m m % 2006 434.4 434.4 5.1 2005 422.9 422.9 5.8 After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Company, the interest rate profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 2 March 2006 was: Fixed rate weighted average Floating Floating Interest Time Fixed rate rate Total interest rate rate period m m m % % Years 2006 135.0 174.2 309.2 1.2 5.4 0.2 2005 135.9 161.0 296.9 1.7 5.4 1.1 Included within the above is 135.0m 2005: 135.0m of notional principal amounts in relation to four interest rate swaps.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps note 8D was estimated by the finance providers based on market conditions at the year end.
The values were calculated using their valuation models with mid-market rates.
The floating rate borrowings bear interest at rates based on LIBOR for periods of between one month and six months.
All four swaps matured on 26 April 2006.
Subsequent to the year end, the Company has taken out three interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 60.0m.
The floating rate debt included above includes 129.2m 2005: 116.0m which is interest free.
LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 87 8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued B MATURITY ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities was as follows: 2 March 2006 27 February 2005 Bank and Bank and other other borrowings Total borrowings Total m m m m Within one year or on demand 129.2 129.2 116.9 116.9 Between one and two years Between two and five years 180.0 180.0 180.0 180.0 Over five years As at year end 309.2 309.2 296.9 296.9 After the year end, the Company has paid down 30.0m of the 180.0m drawings under its facility following partial repayment of intercompany receivables.
The bank loans can be repaid by the Company upon giving 10 working days notice.
However, the facility is committed for a term up to December 2009 unless the Company contravenes covenant arrangements.
C BORROWING FACILITIES The Companys undrawn floating facilities at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2 March 27 February 2006 2005 m m Expiring after two years 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 Of these facilities, 70.0m 2005: 70.0m is committed and secured by means of a floating charge over the Companys current and future assets.
The floating charge also secures the bank loans drawn down of 180.0m in B above.

ii Drawings made under the Companys floating rate facility, where fair value approximates to book value.
iii Amounts owed by or to Group undertakings are repayable upon demand, and the fair value of these items is deemed not to be materially different to their book value.
iv The fair value of interest rate swaps have been determined with reference to market rates at the balance sheet date.
At 2 March 2006 the book value of these swaps equates to their fair value as these derivatives are stated at their fair value under FRS 26.
E HEDGES ON FUTURE TRANSACTIONS The Companys policy is to manage interest rate risk by using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The unrecognised losses on interest rate swaps as at 27 February 2005 are disclosed in note 8D.
Following the implementation of FRS 25 and FRS 26 during the year to 2 March 2006, these interest rate swaps are held within liabilities at their fair value.
These interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting under FRS 26: therefore, changes in their fair value are recorded through the profit and loss account.
F FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES The Company does not trade in financial instruments.

DEFERRED BONUS PLAN Additional potential issues of ordinary shares may arise under the terms and conditions of the Deferred Bonus Plan, as described in note 10 below.
10 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has followed the transitional arrangements within FRS 20, Share-based payment, and has adopted the exemption from full retrospective application of all equity-settled share-based payment awards, and has only applied the measurement requirements of FRS 20 to awards made after 7 November 2002.
However, the following disclosures include all share-based payment awards, therefore including those awards granted prior to 7 November 2002.
The Company operates the following share-based payment plans: A DEFERRED BONUS PLAN In March 2004 the shareholders approved the establishment of the Deferred Bonus Plan the Plan, which seeks to incentivise, retain and reward Executive Directors.
Under the terms of the Plan, 50% of the bonus entitlement of Executive Directors is deferred, being credited to the purchase of notional shares in the Company within the Plan.
The earliest vesting of notional shares awarded under the Plan is three years after the crediting of the notional holding.
Any dividends accrued on the notional shares are accrued to the benefit of the Executive Directors.
The Company will award matching shares, based on the shareholder return of the Company relative to the FTSE 250 Index over the relevant three year period.
Initial awards will vest after 3 years and are dependent on the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The settlement of benefits accruing under the Plan is in equity or cash, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Accounting for the Plan has assumed that awards will be equity-settled.
B 1996 EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME & 1999 COMPANY SHARE OPTION PLAN Options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are granted to senior employees at the market price of the Companys ordinary shares, determined by the average of the mid-market price of one ordinary share on the three days preceding the date of grant.
The options vest between three to ten years following grant date.
Options will not vest unless the employee remains in the service of the Company, and that the relevant performance conditions are met, being that normalised EPS growth must exceed RPI plus 3% compounded over a three year period.
All options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are equity-settled.
Awards will not vest unless the Executive remains in the service of the Company, unless in exceptional circumstances.
LUMINAR plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 90 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 10 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued C NORTHERN LEISURE 1998 EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME ROLLED OVER OPTIONS Options granted under the Northern Leisure scheme are granted to holders of existing Super Options of Northern Leisure Plc, who have elected to release these in exchange for an equivalent option over Luminar plc shares.
The options vest from three to ten years from grant date of the original Super Options.
All options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and accordingly are excluded from the scope of FRS 20.
D SAYE SCHEME Options granted under the all-employee Save-As-You-Earn scheme are available to all Executive Directors and employees with over one years service, with options granted at the prevailing market rate, with no discount given on grant.
Options are exercisable three years after the date of grant, with options exercisable for an 18 month period following the earliest vesting date.
If the employee does not withdraw savings from the plan, all options are equity-settled.
E WARRANT SCHEME On 22 February 1999 the shareholders approved the establishment of a discretionary Trust to hold warrants as part of incentive arrangements under 1 which they are subsequently allocated to employees.
Each warrant carried the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at the price of 6.67 2 per share.
Performance criteria attached to the warrant scheme were met in full in February 2002, and an allocation of 50% of the warrants was made by the Trustee in May 2002.
The remaining warrants are allocable in the absolute discretion of the Trustee who may call for guidance from the Remuneration Committee.
The subscription period in the approved scheme provides that warrants may be exercised in the period of 28 days following the publication of the Annual Report of each financial year up to the year ending on or around 1 March 2009.
F JOOLS HOLLAND The options granted are exercisable five years after the date of grant, and are exercisable for a six month period thereafter, if Mr Holland is still involved with the Group and the Jam House brand at vesting date.
All options granted to Mr Holland will be equity-settled.

The Company recognised a total expense within administration expenses of 0.2m 2005: 0.1m, related to share-based payment transactions, all of which were accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment arrangements with a corresponding credit direct to equity reserves.
The cumulative credit to equity reserves in respect of share-based payments totalled 0.5m 2005: 0.3m.

A PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT FOR FRS 20 AND FRS 21 The effect of the adoption of FRS 20 and FRS 21 is as follows: FRS 20 FRS 21 Total m m m Adjustment to opening reserves at 1 March 2004: Equity reserve 0.1 0.1 Profit and loss reserve 0.1 6.5 6.4 6.5 6.5 Changes to reserves during the year ended 27 February 2005: Profit for the year 0.1 0.1 Dividends for the year: As previously reported 10.1 10.1 As restated 9.5 9.5 Share-based payments charged to equity reserve for: Subsidiary company employees against investments 0.1 0.1 Parent company employees against profit for the year 0.1 0.1 Changes to reserves during the year ended 27 February 2005 0.3 0.6 0.9 RESTATEMENT OF EQUITY AT 27 FEBRUARY 2005 0.3 7.1 7.4 The implementation of FRS 20, Share-based payment changes the Companys accounting for share options.
Previously, the Company recognised a charge for share-based payment awards as the intrinsic value of the award at the date of grant.
Under FRS 20, the Company recognises, at the fair value on grant date, a charge for these share-based payment awards, with a corresponding credit to equity.
For share-based payment awards granted over the Companys shares, but where the employee is employed by other Luminar Group companies, the Company records an investment for the value of these awards, with a corresponding credit to the equity reserve.
The implementation of FRS 21, Events after the Balance Sheet Date changes the Companys accounting for proposed dividends.
Previously under SSAP 17, Accounting for Post-Balance Sheet Events, the Company recorded proposed dividends, with a corresponding liability, within the period to which the dividends related.
Under FRS 21, dividends proposed are not classified as liabilities until the period in which they are approved and authorised.
B PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT FOR FRS 25 AND FRS 26 The Company has taken advantage of the transitional exemption, and not restated the comparative period for the implementation of FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation and FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Instead the implementation adjustment of 0.5m has been charged to retained earnings at the beginning of the current year.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to this adjustment due to the uncertainty over future liabilities against which the asset can be offset.
Under FRS 4, Capital Instruments, the Company accounted for its interest rate swaps by accruing the interest differentials over the life of the swap.
Under FRS 26, as the Company does not qualify for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of its interest rate swaps are taken through the profit and loss account within the interest line.
As a result of the implementation of FRS 26, the Company recorded a liability of 0.5m on balance sheet at 28 February 2005 in respect of these interest rate swaps.
The implementation of the presentational requirements of FRS 25 did not result in any changes to the Companys financial statements.
14 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Company has guaranteed certain lease commitments of third parties, although the Companys potential exposure under these guarantees is unlikely to be material.
15 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS The Company had no capital commitments at 2 March 2006 2005: None.
