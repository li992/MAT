For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has three classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period, the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan and convertible preference shares.
At 29 January 2006, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

No goodwill arose on the acquisition of the Rathbones business note 27 a.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
The Directors do not consider that goodwill can be allocated to individual stores cash generating unit level on a meaningful basis.
Goodwill is consequently allocated to the portfolio of stores representing the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill is tested at this level.
The annual loss for the year is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill has been tested at this balance sheet date.
The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the portfolio of stores and associated goodwill with their aggregate recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is estimated by calculating value in use on a discounted cash flow basis.
The key assumptions used in this calculation are estimates of sales growth, operating margins and the residual value of land.
The assumptions used are based on the Groups Optimisation Plan, which was finalised near the year end, and includes detailed budgets and forecasts prepared on a store by store basis covering the period 2006 to 2008.
Cash flows after 2008 have been estimated by applying a long term growth rate of 1.5%.
Cash flows have been discounted at 8.8%.
As the result of the impairment test indicated that nearly all of the 103.2m was impaired, the Directors have decided that given the sensitivities of the calculation, that a provision for the whole of the goodwill is made.
A charge for impairment of goodwill of 103.2m 2005: nil has been included in the results.
The impairment charge arises principally due to changes in assumptions regarding how long profit recovery will take.
The events and circumstances that led to the recognition of this impairment loss are discussed further in the Financial review.
Interest capitalised in the period is 11.8m 2005: 6.4m.

Short-term flexibility is achieved using overdraft facilities.

Goods purchased in foreign currencies are paid for at the exchange rate ruling at the time of payment.
There continues to be a small amount of exports by the Group but there is no material exchange rate risk associated with this.

Restructuring As a result of the takeover of Safeway, there are 3 distribution centres which are surplus to the requirements of the Group.
A provision has been made to cover the expected costs to close the centres.
It is anticipated that the costs will be incurred in the forthcoming year.
In addition to the above, a further 21m has been provided for impairment in value to the buildings and fittings.
The impairment is based on estimated sale proceeds as valued by the Directors.
Property provisions Property disposal provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve, onerous leases provision and provisions for dilapidations on leased buildings.
Decommissioning costs are incurred when the petrol filling station tanks have reached the end of their useful life or when they become redundant.
A provision is recognised for the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
Onerous leases relate to sublet properties.
Where the rent receivable is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from 1 to 67 years.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to the condition to which it was originally leased.
The costs are due to the landlord on termination of the lease.
