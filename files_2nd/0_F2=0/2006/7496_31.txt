The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the directors for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5%.
The pre tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 11.3%.
