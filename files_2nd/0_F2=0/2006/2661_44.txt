Accounting policies continued Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments A substantial portion of the Groups revenue is received in its functional currency.
As such, currency exposure on revenues is minimal.
Further, the Group minimises foreign currency exposure by netting non-US dollar deposits and payments of winnings in the respective currency.
Additionally, other exposures include interest rate risk from borrowing and the investment of cash balances.
The Group seeks to limit these risks by investing cash in short-term instruments and interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Bank borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
2. Business and geographical segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Groups operations can be segmented into the following four operating divisions: Poker: Casino including Bingo : Sports Betting: and Emerging Games, currently comprising Backgammon.
