Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 are the first to be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union.
Details of the changes in accounting policies arising from the adoption of IFRS, together with restated information for the year ended 31 March 2005, have been provided in Note 32.
The accounting policies set out in that note have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these financial statements with the exception of the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 concerning Financial Instruments.
In accordance with IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has elected not to restate comparative information for the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39, and has only adopted these standards in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006.
This adoption had no financial impact on the financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures Amendment to IAS 19 Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures Amendment to IAS 39 The Fair Value Option Amendment to IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts Issue of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
S Significant accounting policies under IFRS The significant accounting polices adopted in the preparation of the Groups IFRS financial information are set out below.
B Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of MITIE Group PLC and all its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the parent Company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
Adjustments are made in the consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist between UK GAAP and IFRS.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
B Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
G Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Cost of acquisition includes all deferred amounts that become payable in the future.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
It is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in the subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
52 MITIE Group PLC IIntangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement on a straight line basis over its useful life.
R Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Other than in respect of long-term contracts, described below, revenue represents fee income recognised in respect of services provided during the period stated net of value added tax.
Revenue is earned solely within the United Kingdom.
Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end.
Profits are recognised on long-term contracts where the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
In calculating this, the percentage of completion method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost.
Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays.
Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses are forecast.
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less amounts billed on account.
To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in creditors as gross amounts due to customers.
Variations in contract work and claims are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Revenue from bundled contracts consists of various components which operate independently of each other and for which reliable fair values can be established.
Accordingly, each component is accounted for separately as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
L Leasing Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease-term.
Any lease incentives are amortised over the lesser of the life of the operating lease or to the first opportunity for termination.
F Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
R Retirement benefit costs The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes.
The Group also operates a fully insured defined contribution pension scheme, the assets of which are held in independently administered funds.
Payments to the defined contribution pension scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
MITIE Group PLC 53 N Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
P Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property over 50 years Leasehold improvements period of the lease Plant and equipment 3-14 years Annually the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
IInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and estimated selling costs.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
IInvestments All investments are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
Subsequently they are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
54 MITIE Group PLC Financial instruments Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Pre-contract costs All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of costs is virtually certain.
Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within trade and other receivables.
On the contract award these bid costs are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
Share based payments The Group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes.
For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 April 2005.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2 per cent.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs are as follows: 2006 2005 % % Support Services 8.0 8.0 Property Services 8.0 8.0 Engineering Services 8.0 8.0 MITIE Group PLC 61 N Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 12.

This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of the assets approximates their fair value.
All balances are held in sterling.
Included in cash and cash equivalents are deposits totalling 9.6m 2005: 3.8m held by the Groups insurance subsidiary, which are not readily available for the general purposes of the Group.
Bank overdraft and loans The loans are repayable as follows: 2006 2005 m m Overdraft 2.0 Bank loans 31.0 3 33.. 0 All borrowings are in sterling.
The Directors estimate that the carrying amount of the Groups borrowings approximate to their fair value.
The bank loans are repayable within one year and the overdrafts are repayable on demand.

In the year ended 31 March 2005, options were granted on 11 June 2004 and 28 July 2004 in respect of the Executive and Savings Related share option schemes respectively.
The fair value of options granted under the scheme is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2006 2005 Share price p 98161 98130 Exercise price p 99162 99139 Expected volatility % 2830 2830 Expected life years 56 56 Risk-free rate % 4.175.12 4.175.17 Expected dividends % 1.432.12 1.432.12 Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes.
The expected life is based upon historical data and has been adjusted based on managements best estimates for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds controlled by the scheme providers.
The total cost charged to income of 1.1m 2005: 0.9m represents contributions payable to this scheme by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0 and 66 per cent of final salary on attainment of a retirement age of 65.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 April 2006 by Mr David Higgs, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.

MITIE Group PLC 77 N Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32.
Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 April 2004.
K Key IFRS adjustments and their impact on the financial statements IFRS 2 Share-based payments Under IFRS 2, share awards must be measured at fair value at grant date and should be recognised as an expense to operating profit on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
No expense was required under UK GAAP.
The Group has valued all share option awards granted since 7 November 2002 a date specified in IFRS 2 that vest after the effective date of IFRS 2 on 1 April 2004.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes model for the valuations.
The impact is to reduce the Groups reported operating profit by 0.5m for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Related deferred tax assets amounting to 0.3m at 1 April 2004, and 0.7m at 31 March 2005 have been recognised and will be released when the share options vest and are exercised.
IIFRS 3 Business combinations Under IFRS 3, goodwill is no longer amortised and, instead, is assessed annually for impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 2004 will not be restated.
As a result of this change, the Groups operating profit will be increased by the goodwill previously amortised under UK GAAP.
For the year to 31 March 2005, this was 2.8m.
In the year ended 31 March 2005 the loss on disposal of MITIE Generation Ltd included 5.0m of goodwill which arose on acquisition prior to FRS 10 Goodwill and which had previously been written off in reserves.
Under IFRS, this goodwill remains written off in reserves and is not included in the loss on sale.
The loss on sale of MITIE Generation Ltd has been adjusted to 3.8m.
IIAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Under IAS 10, dividends proposed after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Dividends are therefore recorded in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are authorised.
Dividends proposed, but not approved at the balance sheet date have been reversed from the financial statements.
This increased the net assets of the Group by 4.5m at 1 April 2004.
IIAS 12 Income taxes Due to the changes required in respect of pension liabilities and share-based payments, additional deferred tax on these adjustments has been recognised in full.
IIAS 19 Employee benefits The key impact on the Group will be accounting for retirement benefits for defined benefit pension schemes.
The Group has previously accounted for these schemes using SSAP 24 and in accordance with the transition rules under FRS 17.
The adoption of IAS 19 does not result in a significant change to operating profit.
The impact on the Groups balance sheet at 1 April 2004 was to recognise a pension liability of 7.1m equal to the deficit in the defined benefit pension schemes.
The net impact is to reduce Shareholders equity by 5.0m after deferred tax.
