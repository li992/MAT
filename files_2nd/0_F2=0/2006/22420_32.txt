Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or futures contracts on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the Portfolio Managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are due to fluctuations in market prices, cash flow interest rates, liquidity, credit and foreign currency rates.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
It is the boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
Stock selection is a factor which acts to reduce market risk.
The Portfolio Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly to consider investment strategy.
Cash flow interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its debenture stocks, preference and preferred ordinary stocks and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Company may borrow in a variety of currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest via its multi-currency facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure that gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities that can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturities of the Companys existing borrowings are set out in paragraph c overleaf.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by Portfolio Manager research of potential investee companies.
The Companys custodian is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company and their performance is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The maximum credit risk at 30 June 2006 is 2,824,000 30 June 2005: 2,518,000 consisting of dividends receivable from equity shares.
