As permitted under IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, financial instruments in the year ended 30 June 2005 remain recorded in accordance with previous UK GAAP accounting policies, and the adjustment to IAS 39 is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at 1 July 2005.
The IFRS accounting policies applied by the group to the financial information in this document are presented in Accounting policies of the group in the financial statements.
In addition, there is an explanation of the primary impacts of IFRS on the groups financial results and position as previously reported under UK GAAP in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.

These were not discontinued operations under US GAAP.
3 Exceptional items The group presents certain items separately as exceptional.
These are items which, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate.
Exceptional items, as presented by management, do not represent extraordinary items under US GAAP.
An analysis of exceptional items for continuing operations under IFRS is as follows: Year ended 30 June 2006 2005 million million Exceptional items charged credited to operating profit Park Royal brewery accelerated depreciation 29 Seagram integration costs 30 Thalidomide Trust 149 Disposal of property 7 201 Other exceptional items Gain on disposal of General Mills shares 151 221 Gains losses on disposal and termination of businesses 6 7 157 214 Tax exceptional items Tax credit in respect of exceptional items 2 78 Deferred tax exceptional item agreement of brand carrying values 313 315 78 Total exceptional items 472 91 6 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... 4 Dividends The board expects that Diageo will pay an interim dividend in April and a final dividend in October of each year.
Approximately 40% of the total dividend in respect of any financial year is expected to be paid as an interim dividend and approximately 60% as a final dividend.
The payment of any future dividends, subject to shareholder approval, will depend upon Diageos earnings, financial condition and such other factors as the board deems relevant.
Under IFRS, proposed dividends are not considered to be a liability until they are approved by the board for the interim dividend and by the shareholders at the annual general meeting for the final dividend.
The information provided below for the final dividend for each period represents the dividend proposed by the directors but not approved by the shareholders and therefore is not reflected as a deduction from reserves at the balance sheet date.
The table below sets out the amounts of interim, final and total cash dividends paid by the company on each ordinary share.
The dividends are translated into US dollars per ADS each ADS representing four ordinary shares at the noon buying rate on each of the respective dividend payment dates.
In the table above, an exchange rate of 1 $1.85 has been assumed for this dividend, but the exact amount of the payment to US ADR holders will be determined by the rate of exchange on 23 October 2006.
5 US GAAP accounting changes From 1 July 2005 Diageo adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
123 R Share-Based Payment for its US GAAP reporting.
On adoption of SFAS 123 R, Diageo revalued unvested awards in its senior executive share option plan SESOP and recognised a cumulative effect of an accounting change of 2 million net of tax in its US GAAP financial information.
Prior year information has not been restated.
From 1 July 2004 Diageo adopted the provisions of FIN 46 R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which requires the group to consolidate the results, assets and liabilities of variable interest entities if the group is regarded as the primary beneficiary.
Adoption of FIN 46 R had no effect on US GAAP net income or shareholders equity.
