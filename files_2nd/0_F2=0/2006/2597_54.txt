The demerger of Filtrona changed the financing structure of the Group with Filtrona assuming 115.4m of the Groups net debt at demerger on 6 June 2005.
This change to the Groups funding structure was previously presented in the 2005 cash flow statement as an inflow within investing activities with a corresponding decrease in loans shown within financing activities.
This disclosure was considered helpful as it highlighted the impact of the demerger on the funding structure of the ongoing Bunzl Group.
As there was no impact on cash and cash equivalents, the 2005 cash flow statement has been re-presented to exclude this impact of the demerger from both investing and financing activities.
