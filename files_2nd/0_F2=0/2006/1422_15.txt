Accounting estimates and judgements Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the accounting policies detailed on pages 52 to 57, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Forecasts and discount rates The carrying value of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on estimates of future cash flows arising from the groups operations which, in some circumstances, are discounted to arrive at a net present value: The carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually and also when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
This assessment involves comparing the book value of goodwill with its recoverable amount being the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is determined with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate.
No impairment resulted from the assessment conducted in 2006: however, both the projected future cash flows and the discount rate applied involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.
The realisation of deferred tax assets recognised is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise.
The group recognises deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered which is based on an assessment of the likelihood of there being sufficient taxable profits in the future.
Post-retirement benefits The groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.
The accounting valuation, which has been assessed on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in an asset of 169m and a liability of 42m being recognised as at 16 September 2006.
The size of the asset is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes and to the actuarial assumptions, which include price inflation, pension and salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic assumptions and the level of contributions.
Further details are included in note 13.
Provisions As described in the accounting policies on pages 52 to 57, provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These estimates are made taking into account a range of possible outcomes.

Accounting estimates and judgements continued Property, plant & equipment residual values and useful lives These assets are written down to their estimated residual values over their anticipated useful lives using the straight-line basis.
Management reviews residual values annually considering market conditions and projected disposal values.
In assessing useful lives, maintenance programmes and technological innovations are considered.
The carrying value of property, plant & equipment is disclosed in note 10.
Biological assets Cane roots valuation the escalated average cost of planting cane roots is adjusted for the remaining expected life.
This requires an estimation by management of the average number of ratoons expected from the crop.
The carrying value of cane roots is disclosed in note 11.
Growing cane valuation growing cane is valued at the estimated sucrose content valued at the estimated sucrose price for the following season, less the estimated costs for harvesting and transport.
The estimated sucrose content requires management to assess the expected cane and sucrose yields for the following season considering weather conditions and harvesting programmes.
In assessing the estimated sucrose price, management is required to assess into which markets the forthcoming crop will be sold and assess domestic and export prices as well as the related foreign currency exchange rates.
The carrying value of growing cane is disclosed in note 11.
Explanation of transition to IFRS As stated in the accounting policies on pages 52 to 57, these are the groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 16 September 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 17 September 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 18 September 2004 the groups date of transition to IFRS.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out below.
The major changes for the group resulting from the introduction of IFRS relate to: The accounting for business combinations where intangible assets which did not qualify for separate recognition under UK GAAP are now recognised separately from goodwill.
The cessation of amortisation of goodwill.
The accounting for deferred tax on the basis of differences between the book value and tax base of assets and liabilities temporary differences.
This results in deferred tax being recognised in circumstances that did not give rise to deferred tax under UK GAAP.
For example, deferred tax is now recognised on non-qualifying intangible assets even though no tax liability or asset is expected to crystallise in the foreseeable future.
The accounting for derivative financial instruments from 18 September 2005.
These are now reflected in the balance sheet at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value being accounted for immediately in the income statement unless certain conditions are satisfied.
The calculation of profits and losses on the sale of subsidiaries which no longer take account of goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Income statement The adoption of IFRS has little impact on the groups adjusted measures of reported performance which exclude amortisation of intangible assets, profits less losses on the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses and provisions for the losses on termination of operations.
The adjustments that do arise at this level relate principally to the following: The manner in which fair values are attributed to the separable net assets acquired in a business combination.
Under IFRS 3, for finished goods acquired, a margin for selling effort has been deducted to determine the fair value.
The fair valued inventories were sold during the year adjustment a : and The requirement under IFRS to deduct the related tax from the groups share of profits of its associates and joint ventures which are included in operating profit.
99 Financial statements Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the year ended 16 September 2006 34.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued The groups unadjusted measures of performance are also affected by the fact that under IFRS: Goodwill is no longer amortised but intangible assets, which are now recognised in circumstances that would not have been the case under UK GAAP, are amortised adjustment b : Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not taken into account in calculating the profit or loss arising on the sale of businesses adjustment c : and Deferred tax is normally recognised on all differences between the book values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases temporary differences.
Refer below for details adjustment d. Balance sheet The groups net assets at 17 September 2005 are impacted by the following: Goodwill is no longer amortised but tested for impairment annually adjustment b : Intangible assets are now separately recognised from goodwill and are amortised over their estimated useful lives adjustment b : When calculating the profit or loss arising on the sale of businesses, goodwill previously written off to reserves is no longer taken into account adjustment c : With limited exceptions, deferred tax is recognised on all differences between the book values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases temporary differences rather than just certain timing differences as under UK GAAP.
As a result, where intangible assets and tangible fixed assets are acquired as part of a business combination, deferred tax must be recognised on any associated temporary differences.
The income statement is affected post-acquisition because the temporary differences recognised on acquisition subsequently change as a result of depreciation and amortisation.
For goodwill, deferred tax is no longer recorded at the date of acquisition and subsequent tax amortisation and impairment charges will result in deferred tax on goodwill adjustment d : Proposed dividends are no longer reflected as liabilities until they have been approved by the shareholders adjustment e : An expense for all equity instruments granted is now recognised based on the fair value of the grant.
Changes in accounting for share-based payments has only a minor impact as the group does not have any significant share-based incentive schemes adjustment f : Goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisitions subsequent to 3 September 2004 since IFRS 3 has been applied are denominated in local currencies and retranslated at each balance sheet date.
Under UK GAAP, most goodwill and intangible assets were treated as sterling assets adjustment g : A credit adjustment has been made to employee benefits assets and liabilities to take account of different valuation methodologies for pension scheme assets under IAS 19.
Due to the group having previously adopted FRS 17 under UK GAAP, there are no significant differences arising upon transition to IAS 19 adjustment h : Under UK GAAP, all of the groups property leases were accounted for as operating leases.
IAS 17 requires the element of a property lease that relates to land to be considered separately from the element that relates to buildings.
The land element will generally continue to be accounted for as an operating lease but, in certain cases, the buildings element will now be accounted for as a finance lease.
100 Financial statements Annual Report & Accounts 2006 34.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Adjustment has therefore been made to include the fair value of these finance leased buildings within fixed assets, with an obligation of equal amount being provided as a lease creditor.
As these finance leases were acquired in September 2005, there is no impact on the groups net assets.
The finance lease obligations have, however, reduced the groups net funds by 12m at 17 September 2005 refer to note 20 adjustment i : An adjustment for engineering inventories has been recorded as they do not meet the definition of inventories under IAS 2 adjustment j : The group has elected to treat the UK GAAP value of all previously revalued properties as deemed cost and the revaluation reserve has been transferred to retained earnings adjustment k : and As noted previously, the group has adopted IAS 39 from 18 September 2005.
The group enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and commodity prices.
Under IAS 39, such derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 39 is to increase the groups net assets at 18 September 2005 by 7m.
Cash flow Short-term deposits of 376m and overdrafts of 10m were classified as financing cash flows under UK GAAP and are reclassified as cash and cash equivalents under IFRS.
There are no other material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRS and the cash flow statement presented under UK GAAP.
