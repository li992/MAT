This creates a surface tension in the glass.
Tempered glass is six times stronger than PCB assembly ordinary glass.
When toughened glass is broken the tension is PCB assembly involves attaching components such as surface released, which causes the glass to shatter into less-harmful tiny mount devices and capacitors on to a fabricated board, together fragments.
For this reason, toughened glass is specified for many with the required physical and electrical connections.
