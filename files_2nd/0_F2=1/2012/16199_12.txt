OPERATIONS REVIEW WEST & NORTH AFRICA BUILDING ON SUCCESS IN WEST & NORTH AFRICA The West & North Africa region contributes the majority of Tullows production, providing valuable cash flow to fund the Groups exploration activity.
Tullow continues to explore in this prospective area for further high-impact discoveries.
Tullows production in Africa comes from the operated WEST & NORTH AFRICA Jubilee field in Ghana and a number of non-operated fields Regional information 2012 Total in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cte dIvoire, Congo Brazzaville Countries 10 and Mauritania.
In 2012, the Jubilee field exited the year at record production levels and the  Licences 43 TEN development plan was submitted to the Government of Acreage sq km 101,769 Ghana in November 2012.

During the year, the Group also successfully appraised the TEN Cluster Development and submitted a Plan of Development PoD for the TEN project in November 2012.
Approval of the PoD is expected in the near future.
Exploration drilling activity in the Deepwater Tano licence continued throughout 2012.
Jubilee field Phase 1 and Phase 1A Developments Since the start-up of production at the end of 2010 to the end of January 2013, the Jubilee field had produced 55 million barrels of oil.
Gross field production during 2012 averaged 72,000 bopd.
This was slightly lower than envisaged at the start of the year due to productivity issues with some of the wells.
Acid stimulations proved to be the best and most cost-effective Mauritania EDP solution to these issues and well productivity has been restored Senegal E Cte dIvoire EDP at a cost of $160 million gross, significantly below the amount Guinea E originally budgeted at the start of 2012.

The project has progressed well with two wells currently producing and three more expected on stream by the end of the third quarter of 2013.
