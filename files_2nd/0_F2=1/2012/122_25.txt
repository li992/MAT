Margins The volatile economic environment continued throughout the year and there are few signs of this abating.
The impact of increased VAT, poor consumer confidence and a low growth retail environment has led to a change in consumer purchasing behaviour, with value being a clear motivator.
Promotion across branded products has increased and combined with commodity cost inflation the impact has been to squeeze margins.
We have endeavoured to mitigate this impact by delivering price increases across our portfolio and managing raw material cost inflation through a series of operational and financial hedging activities, tight cost control and capital investment programmes focused at delivering improved efficiencies.
Overall like for like net of volume growth our cost of goods increased by 5.5%.
Whilst price increases were secured, increases in the cost of sugar, fruit pulp and PET, together with a changing mix associated with still products growing at a faster rate than carbonates, led to a reduction in gross margin of 100 basis points.
Gross margins pre exceptional items reduced from 51.6% to 50.6%.
Carbonates gross margins were more resilient at 56.8% previously 57.4%, whilst stills margins declined from 30.8% to 29.2% as the increased cost of fruit pulp fed through to a higher cost of goods.
In the year ahead we expect input cost inflation to once again be in the region of 4-5%.
Current market pricing for PET is flat year on year, fruit pulp costs are lower but the cost of sugar continues to trend upwards.
35.4m Profit before tax increased 16.4% to 35.4m.
