INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT The Investment Manager remains pleased with the performance of NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Limited the Company for the year to 31 December 2012.
As at 31 December 2012, the Company was fully invested in 182 investments across 147 issuers.
Industry diversification remains strong with the Company invested across 33 sectors, with no single one sector representing more than 11% of the portfolio.
The credit quality of the portfolio remains in line with our expectations, with 39.29% of the Company being invested in Ba rated investments, and 54.74% in B rated investments.
During the year, and particularly during the second half, the Company reduced the potentially volatile components of the portfolio.
Bond exposure dropped from 12.6% at the end of 2011 to 6.96% at the end of 2012, which reflects both the convergence of loan and bond spreads and also profit-taking as markets rallied.
The Companys non-US exposure has come down dramatically from 11.9% at the end of 2011 to 4.55% currently.
This reflected some profit-taking, but also concerns about the European macroeconomic situation.
Between 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, the Companys NAV rose by 5.37% and 4.99% for the U. S. Dollar and Sterling series of Ordinary Share Class respectively.
The NAV returned plus dividends declared in the period was 10.60% and 10.23% for the U. S. Dollar Shares and Sterling Shares respectively.
As at 31 December 2012, the share price was trading at a premium of 1.93% for the USD shares and 0.78% for the GBP shares.
During the year, the Company declared four dividends, which were paid in February, May, August and November.
Post the year-end, the Company declared a further dividend, which was paid to investors on 22 February 2013.
During 2012, the dividend yield of the Company was 4.94% and 4.96% for the USD Ordinary Shares and GBP Ordinary Shares respectively, which is around the Companys 5% target range.
The Companys expectation is that, if market conditions and interest rates remain at their current levels, the annualised dividend will remain constant also.
Market Environment The loan markets in both the US and Europe saw strong demand throughout the year as investors looked for opportunities to earn a decent running yield, whilst limiting downside risk and duration in portfolios, which led some to switch into loans from both investment grade and high yield bond portfolios.
In the US, the S&P LSTA Loan Index returned 9.66% for the year with the majority of the return generated in the first and third quarters.
Larger loans, as represented by the S&P LSTA 100, outperformed the overall market slightly at 10.50%.
By ratings, CCCs led the way with an 18.35% return followed by single-Bs at 10.42% and double-Bs at 7.17%.
In Europe the S&P European Leveraged Loan Index ELLI returns were similarly robust at 9.48% for the year with Q1 and Q3 also being the prime drivers at 4.36% and 2.33% respectively.
Flows into the loan market in the US were strong, totalling $53.5bn from CLOs and $8.5bn from mutual funds.
Additionally, whilst difficult to formally track, pension funds and relative value investors are thought to have been investing $1-2bn per month through the year.
This demand has been met by strong new issuance which ended the year at $295bn up from $231bn last year, the third best year on record.
The majority of this was related to refinancings and dividend recapitalisations.
As a result, the maturity wall that was seen as a major issue for the asset class a few years ago continues to be eroded with just $48 billion of maturities due by yearend 2014 vs. the loan market of $551 billion.
The buoyant picture in the US was not replicated in Europe where we saw only 15 billion of new institutional loan issuance in the year.
ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2012 and period ended 31 December 2011 5 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 AND PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 ANNUAL REPORT INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT continued Market Environment continued Defaults in the S&P LSTA Loan Index moved up from 0.17% at the end of 2011 to 1.27% by the end 2012 but remain well below the long-term average of 3.31%.
We believe defaults will continue to move up in the coming years but still remain below the longterm average.
Our default forecast of 2.0% in the US for 2013 is driven by the overall health of our investable universe, including strong free cash flow generation, solid liquidity positions and minimal pending maturities.
Our European view is not as positive and we do think that a number of European issuers will continue to have fundamental operational liquidity issues given the more negative macro picture in the continent.
We forecast a default rate in Europe of between 57% for the coming 12 months with the current trailing rate being 6.6%.
