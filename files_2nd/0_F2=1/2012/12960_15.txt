Massawa gold project Massawa is a grassroots exploration discovery in eastern Senegal.
Randgold owns 83.25% in partnership with a local company who owns 6.75%, after providing for the State of Senegals right to a non-contributory 10% share of any mine developed on the property.

This will allow us to accurately Senegal, straddling the original Randgold Kanoumering and model the lodes, determine the short range grade variability Kounemba exploration permits.
The project is located about and predict the optimal drill spacing and estimation criteria for 700 kilometres south east of the capital city of Dakar and an accurate estimate.
approximately 90 kilometres due west of Randgolds Loulo operation in Mali.
The majority of the fresh ore at Massawa is refractory in nature with gold locked inside arsenopyrite and only recoverable Massawa is located within the Kedougou-Kenieba erosional by means of a pre-oxidative step to liberate the gold prior to inlier which is underlain by lower proterozoic birimian leaching.
Batch testwork has shown pressure oxidation to be  sequences.
Regionally it is located very effective in releasing the gold from the sulphides.
The on the plus 150 kilometre long northeast-southwest trending process requires otation of the sulphides to concentrate the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone MTZ which is a significant ore and processing of the concentrate through a high pressure transcrustal dislocation between the Mako Supergroup and temperature autoclave which oxidises the sulphides.
The basaltic ow rocks, minor intercalated volcaniclastics and oxidised ore is neutralised with limestone and lime following ultramac sub-volcanic intrusions and the Diale-Dalema which it is processed through a normal CIL train to recover Supergroup volcano-sedimentary to sedimentary rocks the gold.

The aim of this programme was to investigate grade variability associated with the high grade quartz antinomy phase of Subsequent meetings have been held with the newly appointed gold mineralisation.
The results confirm the continuity of the Senegalese Minister of Mines to explore possible power options structures which host the high grade mineralisation and which for Massawa.
Investigation of micro-barrage hydroschemes is are surrounded by an envelope of low grade disseminated pyrite also in progress.
Underground mineral resources are those in situ mineral resources below the US$1 500 oz pit shell of the North 2 deposit reported at a 2.0g t cut-off.
Mineral resources were generated by Mr Babacar Diouf, an officer of the company and competent person.
Open pit mineral reserves are reported at a gold price of US$1 000 oz and 1.1g t cut-off and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Open pit mineral reserves were calculated by Mr Onno ten Brinke, in the capacity of independent consultant, and reviewed by Mr Rodney Quick, an officer of the company and competent person.
Attributable gold Moz refers to the quantity attributable to Randgold based on its 83.25% interest in Massawa.

Metallurgical sampling is currently underway to support pilot pressure oxidation testwork planned to be completed by Hazen in Denver during 2013.
This is critical to confirm recoveries, reagent consumptions and processing operating costs of the pressure oxidation PoX and CIL circuits.
The revised geological modelling based on the close spaced orientation drilling will be used to update the geological model and mineral resource estimate.
Ground hydrological modelling will also be undertaken as well as an update to the environmental and social studies that have already been conducted.
Geotechnical studies to a feasibility level are complete.
