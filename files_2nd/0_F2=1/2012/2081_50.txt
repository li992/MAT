MRN Washed tonnes and grade represent expected product based on forecast beneficiated yield in the resource area.
This resource is reported with dilution.
2 Approximate drill hole spacings used to classify the reserves were: Deposit Proved Ore Reserves Probable Ore Reserves Worsley Maximum 80m Maximum 160m MRN A bauxite intersection grid of 200m, plus at least 10 samples Those areas with a bauxite intersection grid spacing of less reached by searching ellipsoid.
Mining and metallurgical than 400m and or a 400m spaced grid with a 200m offset fill in, characterisation test pit bulk sample, plus a reliable suite plus a minimum of seven samples reached by searching ellipsoid, of chemical and size distribution data plus a reliable suite of chemical and size distribution data 3 Metallurgical recoveries for the operations were: Deposit Estimated Metallurgical Recovery of A. Al O 2 3 Worsley Worsley Refinery 88% MRN Alumar Refinery 94% 4 MRN The increase in the reserves was due to obtaining the environmental licence for operation for Bela Cruz, as anticipated, in October 2011.
The MRN reserves are located on mining leases that provide MRN the right to mine.
Current mining areas have environmental approval to operate.
As further operational licences are obtained, Mineral Resources will be converted to Ore Reserves.
