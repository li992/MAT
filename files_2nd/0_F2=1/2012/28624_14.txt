Its policy is to fix terms of payment with each supplier in accordance with its requirements and financial procedures.
Rathbones ensures that suppliers are aware of those terms and abides by them subject to the resolution of any disagreement regarding the supply.
In the majority of cases, the terms agreed with suppliers are for payment within 30 days of their invoice date.
Trade creditors of the UK subsidiaries at 31 December 2012 represented 24 days of annual purchases 2011: 36 days.
The 2011 figure was unusually high due to high levels of capital expenditure on the new London office incurred towards the year end.
Financial instruments and risk management The risk management objectives and policies of the Group are set out in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
Indemnification of directors The Company has granted indemnities, which are uncapped, to all directors and to the company secretary by way of deed.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 were therefore in place throughout 2012 and remain in force at the date of this report.

Auditor The audit committee reviews the appointment of the external auditor and their relationship with the Group, including monitoring the Groups use of the auditor for non-audit services.
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements sets out details of the auditors remuneration.
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external auditor, the audit committee has recommended to the Board that the existing auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, be reappointed.
KPMG Audit Plc have indicated their willingness to continue in office and ordinary resolutions reappointing them as auditor and authorising the directors to set their remuneration will be proposed at the 2013 AGM.
The directors in office at the date of signing of this report confirm that there is no relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware and that each director has taken all reasonable steps to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 47 Directors report continued Going concern Details of the Groups business activities, results, cash flows and resources, together with the risks it faces and other factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the chairmans statement, chief executives statement, strategy and key performance indicators, business review, financial review and group risk committee report.
In addition, notes 30 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements provide further details.
The Company is regulated by the FSA and performs annual capital adequacy assessments which include the modelling of certain extreme stress scenarios.
The Company publishes Pillar III disclosures annually on its website, which provide detail about its regulatory capital resources and requirements.
During the year, and as at 31 December 2012, the Group has had no external borrowings and is fully equity financed.
In 2012, the Group has continued to generate organic growth in client funds under management despite challenging market conditions and this is expected to continue.
The directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the continuing uncertain economic and political outlook.
As the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
In forming their view, the directors have considered the Companys prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date the financial statements are approved.
Annual General Meeting The 2013 AGM will be held on Tuesday 14 May 2013 at 12.00 noon at 1 Curzon Street, London W1J 5FB.
Full details of all resolutions and explanatory notes are set out in the separate notice of the meeting.
Special business The resolutions proposed include an ordinary resolution to give the directors the authority to allot up to 15.1 million shares with an aggregate nominal amount of up to 755,000.
The Board is also seeking to renew, by special resolution, the existing authorities to waive pre-emption rights and to make market purchases of ordinary shares under certain stringent conditions both subject to limits.
The annual special resolution seeking the authority to convene a general meeting other than the AGM with not less than 14 days notice is also proposed.
A resolution will also be proposed regarding the payment of the interim dividend.
Distributions made by a company must not exceed the distributable profits as reported in the last set of relevant accounts of the company.
In addition, Section 831 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes an additional requirement on a public company which may only make a distribution if its net assets are not less than the aggregate of its called up share capital and undistributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate.
At the date of the payment of the interim dividend on 7 October 2012, the relevant accounts were the 2011 annual accounts.
Following the payment of the 2011 final dividend and when taking into account treasury shares and other own shares held in employee benefit trusts which reduce the amount distributable under the test in Section 831, the 2012 interim dividend exceeded the value of the Companys net assets less the aggregate of its called up share capital and undistributable reserves as stated in the 2011 annual report and accounts.
This technical non-compliance with the terms of the Companies Act 2006 could, in theory, result in a right for the Company to claim for repayment of the relevant dividends from shareholders who received those dividend payments and or from the directors who approved the payments.
In order to put the shareholders and directors into the position in which they were always intended to be, the Company proposes to release and waive any such claims.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM to approve such release and waiver and to protect current and former directors and shareholders against any claim in connection with the 7 October 2012 interim dividend payment.
It is anticipated that all directors will be at the AGM and available to answer questions.
