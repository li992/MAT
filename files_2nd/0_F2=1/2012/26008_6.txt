Business review How value ows to shareholders Our earnings are dependent on the successful execution of our business model Clients Assets under Net revenue Direct Management fees management Institutions less rebates and Intermediaries commissions Financing Variable Fixed charges costs costs Distributed Profit via dividends Value created for shareholders Tax Re-invested for growth How value is created We manage client assets with the aim of adding value by outperforming the market.
We collect fees from clients, based on a percentage of the assets we manage, a proportion of which are paid to our distributors for the services they perform on behalf of their clients.
Our net revenues are, therefore, the proportion of fees we retain.
On a small number of funds, we also earn a performance fee where returns are above agreed targets.
This revenue is used to meet our expenses.
First, we pay our xed costs which include salaries and those costs associated with the operating platform and support infrastructure.
Out of the residual earnings that result, we then pay variable costs such as bonuses, as well as interest to service our debt and corporation tax.
Of the remaining profits, a portion is distributed to shareholders via dividends with the remainder being used to pay down debt and for re-investment within the Group to grow the business and provide capital growth for shareholders.
