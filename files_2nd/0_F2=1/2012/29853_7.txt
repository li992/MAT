Grafton Group Industrials UK IRE 24,922 3.93 Grafton is a distributor of building products that operates across the British Isles and also has a small Belgian and a very small Polish business.
The group operates from about 500 sites in the UK, and this is by far the groups most important market, accounting for 75% of sales and almost all of current profits.
The groups origins lie in Ireland, where it is very clearly the largest builders merchant, with its 100 sites and estimated 30% market share making it four times the size of the next largest operator.
Grafton also has a significant presence in the Irish DIY market, where it is even more dominant, accounting for over 60% of big box DIY space.
Builders merchants operate in a structurally attractive market, with deep economic moats existing and there are no obvious threats to the business model.
Therefore, whilst the groups profitability in the UK and, especially, Ireland is currently depressed, there is no reason to believe that the far higher profits generated in better economic times will not be revisited, once the economic cycle begins to turn..
