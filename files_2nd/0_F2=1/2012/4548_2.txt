I remain very positive about the Groups prospects.
A There are very few companies that operate within The integration of Eurovet has delivered the expected A the veterinary pharmaceutical market: the majority of immediate synergies and significant additional synergies the worlds veterinary pharmaceuticals are marketed will be realised throughout the remainder of the integration by big pharma.
Eurovet was a company which had process.
The enlarged Groups product range has also complementary competencies and products, and created sufficient critical mass for us to trade through our was of a scale suitable to be acquired by Dechra.
We own subsidiaries in more geographies.
Our product range first approached Eurovet over six years ago as it was will continue to be enhanced from our robust product very clear to me that in terms of geography, products, pipeline and with major significant novel products on the manufacturing capabilities and management, it was horizon, our portfolio will go from strength to strength.
The acquisition We have delivered good growth against a background has extended the Groups capabilities into farm animal of global recession: as the economy improves, footfall products: it has added significant scale in Germany and increases in veterinary practices and world demand for Benelux: brought sterile manufacturing capabilities to farm animal produce continues to increase, we expect this the Group and further strengthened our management growth to continue.
how has the recession affected Dechra and Q the veterinary market?
The recession has had limited effect on Dechra as the A majority of our products are used to treat sick animals which continue to be treated by veterinary practices.
how has the Group strategy developed since What significant changes have you seen in Q Q Additionally, we have delivered new products and you became Chief Executive?
Dechra in the last ten years?
generated good geographical expansion: therefore, we have been able to deliver solid growth throughout the Prior to my appointment as Chief Executive in November Historically the Groups turnover and profitability A A recession.
However, historic high growth rates within the 2001, I was asked by the Non-Executive Directors to was driven by NVS, our Services business.
With the veterinary markets in the majority of our key territories outline my growth strategy.
Although I was Managing successful delivery of our strategy, Group profits are have slowed down.
This slow down in growth rates is Director of NVS at the time, it was evident to me that the now predominantly derived from our international predominantly due to reduced consumer spend in semibiggest opportunity for the Group was to develop our pharmaceuticals business, DVP.
We have therefore discretionary items, such as specialist pet diets like our pharmaceutical business.
The strategy was therefore successfully transformed the business from being a low Specific branded diets and flea products, where there is to utilise NVSs strong cash generation to invest in margin distribution business into a high margin specialist either a cheaper retail alternative or there is a consumer product development of specialist companion animal veterinary pharmaceuticals company.
There has clearly choice not to treat.
This predominantly focused on been enormous change throughout the period as we Prescription Only Medicines POMs in therapeutic have also grown from being a UK centric business to an areas for which there were inadequate products at the international pharmaceutical company with sales and time.
In reality the strategy has changed little since my marketing teams in North America and the majority of appointment, although our product pipeline is now Western European countries.
We also have marketing considerably stronger and Dechras Pharmaceutical partners in over 40 other countries around the globe.
segments are now self-funding and do not rely on NVSs From a management perspective we have developed cash generation.
