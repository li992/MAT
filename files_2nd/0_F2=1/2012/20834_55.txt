Directors remuneration report continued Executive Directors Capital Builder Plan participations and estimates to date The applicable classes of business which will determine the rewards payable to each of the Directors of the Company participating in the Capital Builder Plan are the classes which they themselves underwrite or underwrote or the classes over which they had direct influence at the relevant time and the underwriting results of Syndicate 2001 the part of the business in which both Directors were principally engaged as a whole.
Awards were made in each of the years 2008 to 2012 inclusive, in respect of performance periods of five underwriting years commencing in the year each respective award was made.
Forecasts of rewards in respect of all performance periods are subject to change, particularly in respect of later performance periods.
Subject to that caveat, the forecast rewards based on earned premium and reserving as at 31 December 2012, for the periods stated to date, are as set out below.
Where a positive result on the Syndicate creates a shortfall against the demanding return targets on individual classes, no payment will be due as in the case of Brian Carpenter on each of the years as estimated to date.
