Bill Nikie Michael and Son Services Providing world-class customer service to customers when they visit a counter is a key part of Fergusons strategy.
In 2010 11, we introduced the one hour Will Call service tohelp counters provide better service to the customer, manage labour and therefore gain market share.
The Will Call service enables customers to phone in their orders and have them ready for pick up within one hour.
Thebenets of Will Call are that customers spend less time waiting.
It also frees up our branches and reduces overall wait times particularly at peak periods.
Due to its success, Will Call has been rolled out across the Ferguson Blended Branches business and has grown to represent more than 20 per cent of total counter sales.
