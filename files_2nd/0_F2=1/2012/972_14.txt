Nickel can be produced from two professionals capable of meeting our different ore types: sulphides and future needs.
This has resulted in a large number of processing technologies that have made the industry a very complex one, with high processing costs and capital intensity.
Production is concentrated among the biggest five producers, which between them are responsible for almost half of global output.
