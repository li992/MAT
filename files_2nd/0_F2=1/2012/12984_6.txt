Online and mobile revenues grew by 66.7% to 6.0m as a result of better in-venue promotion of the brand, product upgrades including the launch of a new iPhone app and an increase in marketing expenditure.
Despite this growth, Grosvenors digital casino remains subscale.
We believe that closer integration between venues and digital channels is the key to realising the brands multi-channel potential.

es, offering a range of games, including traditional Spanish favourites mus and chinchon, as well as roulette and poker.
We expect to be able to offer bingo online from the third quarter of 2012 13.
However, until online slot games are brought within the licensing regime enracha.
es is unlikely to make a material contribution to the Groups results.
Belgium a new brand partner The legalisation of online gaming exclusively for licensed land-based gaming companies in Belgium presented Rank, as the operator of two of the countrys nine casinos, with a new opportunity for growth in that market.
Given the complexity and cost of regulation in Belgium, we prefer a partnership approach rather than entering the market directly.
On 14 August 2012, we agreed the terms of a strategic partnership with online sports betting operator Unibet to secure a licensed online casino for the Belgian market.
This partnership remains subject to approval by the Belgian Gaming Commission.
Social networks a new route to market The increasing popularity of gaming via social networks represents both an opportunity and a challenge for Ranks brands.
In response to customer demand, we intend to make a number of social games available to play on Facebook during 2012 13.
Nevertheless, whilst we are excited by the opportunity that these games represent for market growth, we remain concerned about the absence of regulation in this sector.
