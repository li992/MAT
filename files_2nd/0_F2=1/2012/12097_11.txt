Our Assets Albyn Ramp-up to full production Albyn is an open-pit, hard-rock mine.
Ore is Key facts Progress against 2012 processed in an on-site RIP plant, which was commissioned in Q4 2011 and expanded in strategic priorities Q2 2012.
Deposit type Explore Hard-rock, 100% non-refractory ore Continued exploration success at Elginskoye Ore at Albyn contains coarse particles of visible gold.
Metallurgical tests completed Mining Develop to date have shown with confidence that Open-pit, 2 pits currently active Additional 1.8Mtpa RIP plant commissioned, mineralisation is entirely non-refractory, so the doubling production capacity Processing ore at Albyn may be processed in the current On-site RIP plant, capacity c. 3.6Mtpa to Operate plant rather than trucked to the POX Hub 4.0Mtpa Annual production of 89,300oz: ramp-up throughout the duration of the mine life.
of RIP plant to full capacity Licence acquired The main Albyn licence area was acquired 2005 Sustainability as a greeneld project in 2005 and is still not Achieved ISO 14001 accreditation Commercial start up fully explored.
In 2010, the Group obtained 2011 two further licences: Elginskoye, a highly 2 prospective 325km licence area 15km west 2013 Strategic priorities JORC Reserves and Resources of the RIP processing plant, and Kharginskoye, 1.27Moz of Ore Reserves and 3.47Moz for Albyn which borders Albyn to the south and covers of Mineral Resources extensions of Albyns mineralised structure.
Continued exploration at Elginskoye, Both licence areas are signicantly underwhich remains highly prospective and Contribution to the Groups explored, but work conducted to date has under-explored 2012 gold production indicated that they offer potential.
Exploration of the newly-acquired Afanasevskaya licence area in H2 2013 Performance in 2012 During 2012, Albyn produced 89,300oz of gold following the commissioning of the mine in Location November 2011. c. 13% Albyn lies approximately 150km from 89,300oz Malomir in the Selemdja district in the The mine went through a prolonged ramp-up north-east of the Amur region, a region period during H1 2012 and reached its design of previously extensive alluvial mining.
throughput capacity of c. 3.6Mtpa to 4.0Mtpa in August 2012, following the commissioning of the second processing line in June 2012.
This period was complicated by the challenging infrastructure, adverse weather conditions, and in particular, problems with the water and electricity supply.
The team successfully overcame these challenges and, by Q3 2012, Gold mine the plant was working to its design capacity of City or town 3.6Mtpa to 4.0Mtpa of ore. Railway Albyn Federal highway Total cash costs at Albyn were US$980 oz, hampered by the mines prolonged BAM Railway ramp-up period.

During its first six months in production, we battled through difficult weather conditions and infrastructure challenges.
However, our experience as a successful mine developer came into play and full capacity was reached by the third quarter.
We now look forward to a year of uninterrupted operations, as Albyn lives up to its potential.

These include measures designed during the period from 2013 to 2018. to improve the efficiency of waste rock stripping as well as to reduce dilution.
Thanks The Group is exploring several promising to these improvements, the Group anticipates licence areas around Albyn, which are gaining access to higher grade Reserves expected to signicantly improve production towards H2 2013, allowing process grades at Albyn and prolong the life of the mine.
to increase to the range of 1.3g t to 1.8g t. It is planned that during the first half of the year, whilst scheduled stripping works are carried out, the head grades of ore through the plant will be lower than in 2012, but that should be compensated by higher grades in the second half of the year, thus resulting in an increase in average grades for the year compared to 2012.
The current base-case mining schedule is expected to signicantly improve in the midto long-term due to good exploration results in 2012.
In 2013, the Albyn mine is expected to contribute c. 20% to 21% of the Groups total production.
