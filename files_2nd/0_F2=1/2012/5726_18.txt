In order to coke consumption by 20% and natural gas ZSMK.
EVRAZs other Russian steel plant, improve customer knowledge of EVRAZ and its by 50% through the use of an additional EVRAZ NTMK, operated at utilisation rates of products, customers will also have an 150 kg of PCI coal per tonne of pig iron.
Design and construction works on PCI almost 100% throughout the year.

r ramp-up of steel production capacity at Efforts to reduce operating costs at EVRAZ EVRAZ NTMK to 4.5 million tonnes per NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK during 2012 were EVRAZ continued to dominate the Russian annum: focused on improvements to regular long products market during 2012, with its r a further step towards the long-term target maintenance works and streamlining of market share in beams totalling 80%, of product mix expansion to high value dealings with third party service providers, structural shapes angles and channels 45% added products, with the start of production which allowed for cost savings amounting to and rebars 19%.
Generally the Russian long of new beams from continuously cast almost US$83 million RUB 2.5 billion during products market demonstrated healthy billets: the reporting year.
The 2013 cost saving demand dynamics in 2012, with rebars and r improved recovery rates of vanadium from initiatives will be targeted towards an overhaul beams recording a growth of 19% compared to slag at EVRAZ NTMK 83.5% vs. budgeted of the Companys procurement system to 2011.
This demand was mostly driven by 75.8%: increase inventory turnaround, lower storage increased infrastructure and industrial r increase electricity generation capacity of costs and improve productivity.
In contrast, the Russian the EVRAZ ZSMK power plant by almost market for hot-rolled sections ended 2012 10% or 350,000 kWh compared to 2011.
Pursuant to the long-term contract for supply with a minor reduction in demand with of industrial gases to EVRAZ NTMK signed two historically low flat steel prices causing an 2012 Production years ago with Praxair Rus, the latter is building increase in hollow section use in applications, In 2012 EVRAZ ZSMK EVRAZ Consolidated new modern air separation plants at the where substitution is possible.
West Siberian Metallurgical Plant produced EVRAZ NTMK site.
Upon completion, Praxair 5.7 million tonnes of pig iron, 7.3 million will supply EVRAZ NTMK with more than 3,000 During 2012, prices for all long products, tonnes of crude steel and 6.5 million tonnes of tonnes of oxygen, nitrogen and argon daily.
As except railway products, were suppressed by steel products.
a result, the Company will also increase its weak underlying pricing for billets in energy efficiency by more than 30%.
