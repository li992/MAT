Our Assets Pokrovskiy Future home of new processing hub Pokrovskiy is a hard-rock open-pit gold mine Key facts Progress against 2012 located in the Amur region, Russian Far East.
To date the mine has produced more than strategic priorities 1.75Moz of gold.
Deposit type Explore Hard-rock, non-refectory ore. Central Continued exploration of Pokrovskiy The mine was the Groups first: Pokrovskiy Pokrovskiy deposit surrounded by satellites and satellite deposits was acquired by Dr Pavel Maslovskiy Honorary President when it was still at an Mining Develop early stage of exploration and when Peter Open-pit.

However, more than ten years after it first produced gold, quality new Resources continue to be discovered and production forecasts were substantially exceeded in 2012.
The year ahead is a step-up for us, as conversion to the POX Hub begins.
The future of the company is still being built at Pokrovskiy.

to contribute approximately 8% to 9% of the Groups total production.
The Group plans to continue the heap-leach operations at Pokrovskiy, treating low grade ore as normal, until full depletion of the economically viable Reserves.
The Group continues exploration at the Pokrovskiy satellite deposits and surrounding areas, including Zheltunak and Taldan, for additional non-refractory ores.
