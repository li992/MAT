Overview This section introduces Johnson Matthey and summarises our performance in the year.
It also outlines the groups strategy for delivering superior value.
Delivering Value Leading the Way in HDD Catalysts The market for catalysts to control harmful emissions from heavy duty diesel HDD vehicles, such as trucks and buses, is growing rapidly driven by tightening legislation for both on road and non-road applications around the world.
Johnson Matthey has developed world leading catalyst technology for HDD applications and, as a result, has established a very strong market position thanks to sustained investment in R&D and state of the art manufacturing Contents facilities, including at our plant in Smithfield, USA pictured.
