Trading profit was impacted by a number of factors.
The unwind of the fair value provision, dating from the time of acquisition in 2008, Target return on capital employed reduced by 133 million in the year, to 22 million, and will be immaterial going forward.
We increased our provision against possible 14.6% claims arising from the sale of PPI by 57 million in the first half of the 13.3% 13.3% 12.9% year.
With no further adjustments in the second half, we ended the year with a net provision of 75 million.
Our decision to slow down the final stages of migration also impacted profit by around 40 million which will now begin to reverse.
Bad debts reduced by 5.2% in the year due to the application of our robust credit policy.
The Banks overall capital position improved, from 10 11 11 12 14 15 TARGET an already good position.
Liquidity has also improved, with the retail bond issues giving us greater diversity in the Banks funding position.
We held our two debt metrics, fixed charge cover and net indebtedness, broadly flat this year.
Both measures will of course be directly affected Tesco Bank trading profit by the UK investment plan we have announced for the coming year.
Our target for fixed charge cover is between 4 and 4.5 times and, for 264m 250m net indebtedness, is 2.5 times.

Capital work-in-progress The level of capital work-in-progress WIP on the UK balance sheet now stands at around 2 billion.
Building out stores faster than we acquire new sites will be a key contributor to UK space growth over the next few years, and will reduce this level of WIP.
The completion of mixed use schemes within the WIP balance will also play a significant role in bringing it down to a more appropriate level, although the construction phase on these schemes will add to the WIP balance in 2012 13, followed by a rapid reduction thereafter.
In some instances, we may also dispose of standalone sites that do not meet our new, more rigorous returns hurdles.
