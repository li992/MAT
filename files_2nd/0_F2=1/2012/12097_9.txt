Our Assets Pioneer Remains the Groups agship mine Pioneer is a hard-rock open-pit mine in the Key facts Progress against 2012 Amur region, Russian Far East.
The mine was acquired as a greeneld deposit in 2001 strategic priorities and subsequently explored, developed Deposit type Explore and constructed in-house and nally Hard-rock.
Contains both refractory New areas of high-grade ore discovered: commissioned in 2008.
It is now one of the and non-refractory ore further potential to signicantly expand largest gold mines in Russia in terms of its the existing Resource base annual gold production and its processing Mining capacity.
It is also the Groups agship mine, Open-pit Develop producing c. 47% of its total gold production Successful expansion of the RIP plant Processing in 2012. and heap-leach facility On-site 6.0Mtpa to 6.6Mtpa RIP plant plus heap-leach facility Operate Ore at Pioneer is currently processed in Production of 333,600oz, 17% higher an on-site RIP plant.
In addition, during Licence acquired than the Groups target at the start of 2012 the warmer months of the year, the mines 2001 as a greeneld project: developed heap-leach facility is used to process its in-house Sustainability lower grade ore.
Achieved ISO 14001 accreditation Commercial start up 2008.
Plant subsequently expanded in 2009, Since commissioning in 2008, in line 2010 and 2012 into bulk tonnage operation with the Groups long-term plan, Pioneers 2013 Strategic priorities RIP plant has undergone three expansions.
JORC Reserves and Resources for Pioneer In 2008, the plant was generally only 4.5Moz Mineral Resources, 2.2Moz processing higher-grade ore from the Continued exploration of newly-identied Ore Reserves Andreevskaya deposit, however, these mineralised zones to upgrade into JORC expansions have enabled the cost-effective Resources Contribution to the Groups processing of bulk tonnage, lower grade Preliminary exploration of geological 2012 gold production ores from across the mine site.
The plant trends within the newly-acquired licence now has a processing capacity of 6.0Mtpa area to the north to 6.6Mtpa The current processing facilities at Pioneer Location only enable the mine to produce gold from c. 47% Pioneer is located in the Amur region, approximately 38% of its current Reserves.
The remaining ore is refractory resistant Pioneer benets from good infrastructure to direct cyanidation processing methods.
links, including all-weather roads linking In order to process this ore, the Group is the mine to Pokrovskiy, local towns and planning to construct a otation plant at the Trans-Siberian Railway.
Pioneer, which will convert the refractory ore into otation concentrate.
This will then be sent for processing to the POX Hub at the Gold mine Pokrovskiy mine, located approximately 35km City or town away by road.
Planned commissioning of the Railway Pioneer otation plant is Q1 2015.

Together with these, our teams work at commissioning the fourth milling line ahead of schedule and the use of the latest mining machinery, meant we beat our production target yet again.

Pioneer is scheduled to produce gold to have strong exploration potential, with The high stripping volumes, required in 2012 from non-refractory ore for the next three many geological indications underexplored.
to access high-grade oxide material for the years, with production gradually moving Accordingly, the Group is continuing its plant, are expected to decrease signicantly into refractory ore treatment from 2015 extensive exploration programme at Pioneer when the mine starts treating refractory ore when the first otation line is scheduled with a view of extending production from in 2015, thus reducing the cost of mining for commissioning.
The Group plans to increase volumes of heap-leach operations up to The RIP plant is scheduled for a full upgrade 1.4Mt during 2013. to production of otation concentrate in 2017.
The mines heap-leach facility will continue In 2013, the Pioneer mine is expected to gold recovery from the remaining oxide contribute c. 40% to 45% of the Groups Reserves beyond 2020. total production.
