Key Performance Indicators Tracking and driving performance Our directors and Group management use a range of financial key performance indicators KPIs, reported on a periodic basis, to track and drive performance.
These focus on driving future growth, measuring our current year performance, profitability and efficiency and value to shareholders.
These KPIs are set out below and more information is set out in the Financial Review onpages 26 to 30.
We also monitor our performance in non-financial areas.
A detailed explanation of our non-financial KPIs is set out in the Corporate Responsibility section on pages 32 to 36.
