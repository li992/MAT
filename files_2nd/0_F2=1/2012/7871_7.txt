ENGINEERING ADVANTAGE OUR PERFORMANCE Business performance is measured against six elements of our strategy, through group-wide targets and improvement measures.
Each IMI business unit participates in an annual round of planning meetings with the Executive Committee of the Board, during which performance and future plans for that business are reviewed and updated.
These business plans are all aligned with the Group business strategy and include specic local, regional and sector targets and Key Performance Indicators KPIs.
In addition, individual business reviews take place throughout the year on a regular basis enabling the Board to assess performance against tactical and strategic milestones.
58% Sweetspot convergence 55% Our strategy, which is described on page 6, is to increase the proportion of our business that sits in our sweetspot of operation.
For IMI this sweetspot is where we can deploy our differentiated uid technologies in global market niches where we already have, or can aspire to, a leadership position and which benefit from a heightened exposure to the long-term mega-trends of climate change, resource scarcity, urbanisation and an ageing population.
We have set a long term objective to increase the percentage of our revenue which sits within this sweetspot to 75%.
N A Having conducted a detailed bottom-up analysis of all of our operations we calculate 10 11 12 that in 2012 the sweetspot percentage was 58%.
We will update shareholders on how this percentage changes in future annual reports.
6% Organic revenue growth 5% Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of acquisitions, disposals and foreign exchange rate movements.
The revenues from acquisitions are only included in the 3% current year for the period during which the revenues were also included in the prior period.
In 2012, the Groups revenue grew by 3% on an organic basis, reecting more challenging second half conditions in certain markets after the Group achieved organic growth of 5% in the first half.
10 11 12 Operating margins 17.5% 17.0% Operating margins are dened as the ratio of segmental operating profit as a 16.7% percentage of segmental revenues.
IMI has a strong track record of improving margins over the last decade.
In March 2011, we raised our long-term objective for operating margins to 20% for each of our Fluid Controls businesses whilst retaining a 15% target for each of our Retail Dispense businesses.
In 2012, our Retail Dispense businesses achieved a margin of 14.7% 2011: 13.7% and the Fluid Controls businesses achieved a margin of 17.7% 2011: 18.7% mainly reecting the weaker performance in Severe Service.
Overall, Group operating margins were 17.0% compared to 17.5% in 2011.
10 11 12 Business overview 10 BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 163.5m Economic value added 161.1m Economic value added EVA is dened as the segmental operating profit before 129.4m exceptional items after-tax less a capital charge.
The capital charge is arrived at by applying the Groups after-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8% to the average invested capital.
Invested capital is net assets plus net debt, accumulated acquired intangible amortisation previously written off, and the IAS19 pension deficit net of deferred tax and excluding exceptional items in the balance sheet being restructuring provisions and net derivative liabilities.
The 2012 EVA has been calculated on a different basis to previous years and prior year gures have therefore been restated.
The major changes are in respect of the treatment of the accumulated amortisation of acquired intangibles.
10 11 12 0.25 Lost time accident rates The Group takes seriously its responsibility for the safety of all employees, contractors and visitors.
In 2009 we set a target of reducing our lost time accident 0.18 LTA rate to no more than 0.22 accidents per 100,000 hours worked.
In 2012 our three-day LTA rate was 0.11, a 39% improvement compared to 0.18 in the 0.11 previous year and a performance well ahead of the target we set in 2009.
As a result of this encouraging performance, we have decided to report on two metrics, 3 day LTAs and 1 day LTAs which will provide a more challenging target.
Our new target is to achieve a 15% reduction on LTAs by the end of 2015.
10 11 12 CO emissions 2 Our CO emissions in 2012 amounted to approximately 90,000 tonnes, a fall of 2 3.6 2% on last year 2011: 92,000 tonnes.
Normalised against hours worked, our 3.3 3.1 performance improved to 3.1 CO tonnes 1,000 hours worked 2011: 3.3 CO 2 2 tonnes 1,000 hours worked.
This has mainly resulted from Project 20:20 which began in 2011 and identied 20 best practice projects to implement across our top 20 energy-using sites.
This performance means that we have achieved our longer term target to reduce this KPI to no more than 3.2 CO tonnes 1,000 hours worked by 2 2012.
Given this good performance, we have set an ambitious new target to reduce our normalised CO emissions by a further 7.5% to no more than 2.8 tonnes 1,000 2 hours worked over the period 2012 to 2015.
For this new target period we will be 10 11 12 using international CO conversion factors which give a slightly lower normalised 2 gure for 2012 of 3.0 tonnes 1,000 hours.
The 2012 gures exclude new subsidiaries acquired after the target baseline years.
Including these new subsidiaries, our gross and normalised CO2 gures for 2012 are 95,000 tonnes and 3.1 respectively and the LTA rate is 0.16.
