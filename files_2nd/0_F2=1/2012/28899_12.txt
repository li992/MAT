LUnion Canadienne acquisition In October 2012 we completed the acquisition of LUnion Canadienne UC, Quebecs third largest intermediated Personal lines insurer.
The addition of UC builds on RSAs 160 year presence in the province of Quebec, positioning RSA as a top five insurer in that province in addition to solidifying its position as the third largest P&C insurer in Canada.
As the second largest private insurance market in Canada, and the most profitable P&C market in the country, Quebec presents significant opportunities for us to grow our business.
UC comprises around 70% Personal lines business with a strong focus on Motor.
