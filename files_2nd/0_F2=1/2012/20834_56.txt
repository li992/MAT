Use of unissued and existing shares for incentive plans The rules of all those of the Companys incentive plans which can result in the issue or transfer of shares to participants include limits on the overall number of unissued shares over which options may be granted.
The only employee schemes under which either unissued or treasury shares are committed to be issued are the executive share option schemes, the Sharesave plans and the schedules to the PSP and LTIP applying to awards to participants in Switzerland and Continental Europe.
New shares were also issued in 2007 to the trustee of the Share Incentive Plan as SIP Free Shares, but in subsequent years such shares were purchased in the market.
Shares awarded under the PSP and LTIP are intended to be satisfied from shares held, or to be purchased, by the Groups ESOT unless overseas requirements dictate otherwise.
Grant of options over new and or treasury shares under any selective plan, after deducting any such options which have lapsed, are limited to 5% of the issued share capital in any 10-year period.
Grants over new treasury shares under any scheme are also limited to 10% over ten years.
The percentages of the year-end shares in issue, together with the equivalent percentages a year earlier, relating to each of these limits are shown in the table below.
