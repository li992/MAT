Herradura, Mexicos largest open pit gold mine Gold ounces attributable to Fresnillo plc We first began exploration in the Herradura district in 1988, and commenced operations at the new mine in 1998.
In its first full year, the mine produced 90,300 gold ounces and was expected to reach 56 % of total production full capacity at 150,000 ounces per year, with an expected mine life of ten years.
Herradura gold reserves and production ounces Now, 14 years later, operational discipline has increased total Production Reserves koz annualproduction to 314,500 gold ounces in 2012 with an expected 350,000 4,000 6.6 years in remaining mine life due to successful exploration by our team of experienced geologists, continuous reserve replenishment 250,000 3,000 and efficient mining methods.

Fresnillo District The Fresnillo District is one of the oldest mining regions in Mexico, with ofcial records for our namesake mine dating back to the early 1550s.
Our mineral concessions in the District cover 207,000 hectares.
Recognising the exploration potential of the District, in the early nineties our team initiated an integrated programme of geological mapping and geophysical and geochemical surveys to select newdrilling targets in the valley areas around the original mine.
TheCompany invested in a deep drilling programme and located anumber of well-mineralised veins that are now in production.
