They borrow relatively small amounts, but it is a big commitment.
They need it to be easy to make repayments and they like the flexibility to adjust those payments if their circumstances change.
Home credit customers are not always the main breadwinners, but they often control the household budget.
The breadwinners in these households are more likely to be hourly paid or have part-time or casual work rather than be in salaried employment and just under NONhalf of our customers are in receipt of STANDARD non-universal benefits.
Home credit customers value the discipline of the CUSTOMERS weekly visit and appreciate having flexibility on repayments.
The household income of most Vanquis Bank customers is between 15,000 and 30,000 a year.
They use the credit card in a similar way to users of mainstream cards, on the high street, and for internet shopping.
Growth in online shopping and changes in merchants payment policies have made everyday tasks increasingly difficult without a payment card.
The card therefore has a high utility value and offers useful additional consumer protection it is often the only credit card they have.
