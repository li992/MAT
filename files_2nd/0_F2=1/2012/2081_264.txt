Over the performance period, BHP Billitons US$ TSR was 41.6 per cent.
In contrast, the weighted average US$ TSR for the peer group against which the Groups performance was measured was -4.0 per cent.
Of the 15 peer companies, only two companies recorded US$ TSR outcomes in excess of BHP Billitons 41.6 per cent US$ TSR performance one at 45.6 per cent and one at 41.9 per cent, and eight peer companies recorded negative US$ TSR performance over the five-year performance period.
The impact of this 45.6 per cent US$ TSR outperformance by BHP Billiton over the weighted average was to add US$75.4 billion of shareholder value from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2012 over and above performance in line with the weighted average of the comparators as shown in the following graphs.

The actual calculation of TSR for the LTIP performance hurdle assumes that the dividends paid are reinvested in the relevant company on the date that the dividends are paid.
The contribution of dividends to TSR performance will therefore vary from the indicative numbers shown in the table above.
