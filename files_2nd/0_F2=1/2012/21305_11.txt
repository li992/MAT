Risk review Funding risk Liquidity All disclosures in this section pages 172-186 are unaudited and exclude Absa Group unless otherwise stated Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the failure to meet obligations leading to an inability to support normal business activity and to meet liquidity regulatory requirements.
Barclays has a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Management Framework the Liquidity Framework for managing the Groups liquidity risk.
The Liquidity Framework meets the FSAs standards and is designed to ensure that the Group maintains sufficient financial resources of appropriate quality for the Groups funding profile.
The Liquidity Framework is delivered via a combination of policy formation, review and governance, analysis, stress testing, limit setting and monitoring.
Liquidity risk is managed separately at Absa Group due to local currency and funding requirements.
For details of liquidity risk management at Absa, see page 183.
For further detail on liquidity risk governance and framework see page 337.
Liquidity risk stress testing Under the Liquidity Framework, the Group has established the Liquidity Risk Appetite LRA, which is the level of liquidity risk the Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations.
It is measured with reference to anticipated stressed net contractual and contingent outflows for a variety of stress scenarios and is used to size the liquidity pool.
Liquidity Risk Appetite As part of the LRA, the Group runs three primary liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the FSAs prescribed stresses: a three month market-wide stress event: a one month Barclays-specific stress event: and a combined one month market-wide and Barclays-specific stress event.
Under normal market conditions, the liquidity pool is managed to be at least 100% of anticipated outflows under each of these stress scenarios.
Barclays is primarily focused upon the one month Barclays-specific stress scenario, which results in the greatest net outflows of each of the liquidity stress tests.
The combined one month scenario assumes outflows consistent with a firm-specific stress for the first two weeks of the stress period, followed by relatively lower outflows consistent with a market-wide stress for the remainder of the stress period.

Loss of secured financing and Loss of repo capacity at contractual maturity date and incremental haircut widening, depending upon increased haircuts collateral type.
Retail and commercial bank Substantial outflows as Barclays is seen as greater credit risk than competitors.
deposit outflows Intra-day risk Liquid collateral held against intra-day requirement at clearing and payment systems is regarded as encumbered with no liquidity value assumed: and Liquid collateral is held against withdrawal of unsecured intra-day lines provided by third parties.
Intra-group risk Risk of liquidity within subsidiaries becoming unavailable to the wider Group.
Funding concentration risk Additional outflows recognised against concentration of providers of wholesale secured financing.
Off-balance sheet risk Collateral outflows due to market movements, taking account of disputes and mismatches between collateralised and uncollateralised OTC and exchange-traded positions: Outflow of all collateral owed by Barclays to counterparties but not yet called: Anticipated increase in the firm's derivative initial margin requirement in a stressed environment: Collateral outflows contingent upon a multi-notch credit rating downgrade of Barclays Bank PLC: Significant drawdown on committed facilities provided to corporates, based on counterparty type, creditworthiness and facility type: and Drawdown on retail commitments.
Franchise viability Barclays liquidity stress testing recognises that it will be necessary to hold additional liquidity in order to meet outflows that are non-contractual in nature, but are necessary in order to support the firm's ongoing franchise for example, market-making activities.
Mitigating actions Unencumbered marketable assets that are held outside of the liquidity pool, and that are of known liquidity value to the firm, are assumed to be monetised subject to haircut valuation adjustment.
In the summer of 2012, Barclays reduced its risk appetite by tightening limits and extending the time horizon of the LRA.
The reduction was a pre-emptive and precautionary measure in response to market conditions and the LIBOR announcement and senior management resignations.
No material deterioration in funding conditions materialised.
Liquidity regulation Since June 2010, the Group has reported its liquidity position against Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG provided by the FSA.
The FSA defines both eligible liquidity pool assets and stress outflows against reported balances.
The Group also monitors its position against anticipated Basel 3 liquidity metrics the Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR.
The LCR is designed to promote short term resilience of a banks liquidity risk profile by ensuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days.
The NSFR has a time horizon of one year and has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 173 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued In January 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a revised standard for the LCR.
Compared to the previous version of the standard published by the Basel Committee in December 2010, these revisions result in significantly lower stress requirements and allow for the inclusion in the liquidity pool of an additional category of high-quality liquid assets referred to as Level 2B assets.
Furthermore, the Basel Committee announced that the LCR requirement will be subject to a phase-in period between January 2015 60% minimum requirement and January 2019 100% minimum requirement.
The minimum NSFR requirement is to be introduced in January 2018 at 100%.
Based on the revised Basel standards, as at 31 December 2012, Barclays had a surplus to both of these requirements with an estimated Basel 3 a LCR of 126% and an estimated Basel 3 NSFR of 104% 2011: 97%.
Comparing internal and regulatory liquidity stress tests The LRA stress scenarios, the FSA ILG and Basel 3 LCR are all broadly comparable short term stress scenarios in which the adequacy of defined liquidity resources is assessed against contractual and contingent stress outflows.
The FSA ILG and the Basel 3 LCR stress tests provide an independent assessment of the Groups liquidity risk profile.

Barclays will continue to monitor the money markets closely, in particular for early indications of the tightening of available funding.
In these conditions, the nature and severity of the stress scenarios are reassessed and appropriate action taken with respect to the liquidity pool.
This may include further increasing the size of pool or monetising the pool to meet stress outflows.
Notes a Under the previous version of the Basel standards published in December 2010, the Group LCR estimate as at 31 December 2012 was 103% 2011: 82%.
Banks employ a wide range of interpretations and assumptions to calculate the Basel liquidity ratios.
These interpretations and assumptions are subject to change prior to implementation in January 2015 LCR and January 2018 NSFR.
The LCR and NSFR estimates are calculated for the Group on a consolidated basis including Absa Group, in line with the latest guidance from the Basel Committee.
The inclusion of Absa Group in the calculation does not have a significant impact on the estimated ratios.
b Of the three stress scenarios monitored as part of the LRA, the one month Barclays specific scenario results in the lowest ratio at 129% 2011: 107%.
This compares to 141% 2011: 127% under the three month market-wide scenario and 145% 2011: 118% under the one month combined scenario.

The maintenance of the liquidity pool increases the Groups costs as the interest expense paid on the liabilities used to fund the liquidity pool is greater than the interest income received on liquidity pool assets.
This cost can be reduced by investing a greater portion of the Group liquidity pool in highly liquid assets other than cash and deposits with central banks.
These assets primarily comprise government bonds and their inclusion in the liquidity pool does not compromise the liquidity position of the Group.
The composition of the liquidity pool is subject to limits set by the Board, Treasury Committee and the independent credit risk and market risk functions.
In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency, asset type and country.
Given the incremental returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.
As at 31 December 2012 the portion of the Group liquidity pool comprised of cash and deposits with central banks reduced to 85bn 2011: 105bn as a result of a reallocation to government bonds and other highly liquid assets.
Barclays manages the liquidity pool on a centralised basis.
As at 31 December 2012, 90% of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC 2011: 94% and was available to meet liquidity needs across the Group.
The residual liquidity pool is held predominantly within Barclays Capital Inc. BCI.
The portion of the liquidity pool outside of Barclays Bank PLC is held against entity-specific stressed outflows and regulatory requirements.
To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group.
For more information on the governance framework for investing the Group liquidity pool see page 337.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 175 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued Contingent liquidity In addition to the Group liquidity pool, Barclays has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
Whilst these are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
In either a Barclays-specific or market-wide liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted.
In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at heavily discounted prices, Barclays could generate liquidity via central bank facilities.
The Group maintains a significant amount of collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available to raise funding.
For more detail on the Groups other unencumbered assets see page 180.
Funding Structure The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a solid funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due.
The Groups overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base both geographically and by depositor type and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.
Within this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding.
As such, retail and commercial customer loans and advances are largely funded by customer deposits.
Other assets together with other loans and advances and unencumbered assets, are funded by long term wholesale debt and equity.
Trading portfolio assets and reverse repurchase agreements are largely funded in the wholesale markets by repurchase agreements and trading portfolio liabilities, while derivative assets are largely matched by derivatives liabilities.
The liquidity pool is predominantly funded through wholesale markets.
These funding relationships are summarised below as of 31 December 2012: Assets Liabilities a a Customer loans and advances 364bn Customer deposits 336bn 1 Year wholesale funding 101bn Group liquidity pool 150bn 1 Year wholesale funding 138bn b Other assets 163bn b Equity and other liabilities 108bn c c Reverse repurchase agreements and matched assets and liabilities 347bn Repurchase agreements and matched assets and liabilities 347bn b b Derivative financial instruments 466bn Derivative financial instruments 460bn Deposit funding including Absa Group: audited d Deposit Funding 2012 2011 Loans and Loan to Loan to advances to Customer deposit deposit customers deposits ratio ratio Funding of loans and advances to customers bn bn % % Retail and Business Banking 232.8 158.4 147 146 e Corporate Banking 62.9 97.1 65 83 Wealth and Investment Management 21.2 53.8 39 40 Total funding excluding secured 316.9 309.3 102 111 Secured funding 48.8 Sub-total including secured funding 316.9 358.1 88 101 e Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management 316.9 309.3 102 111 Investment Bank 46.2 26.1 177 138 Head Office and Other Operations 0.8 0.2 Trading settlement balances and cash collateral 61.8 50.1 123 142 Total 425.7 385.7 110 118 Notes a Excluding cash collateral and settlement balances.

176 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information The Group loan to deposit ratio as at 31 December 2012 was 110% 2011: 118%.
Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management activities are largely funded with customer deposits.
As at 31 December 2012, the loan to deposit ratio for these businesses was 102% 2011: 111%.
The funding gap for these businesses is met using asset backed securities ABS and covered bonds secured primarily over customer loans and advances such as residential mortgages and credit card receivables, resulting in a loan to deposit and secured funding ratio of 88% 2011: 101%.
The excess of the Investment Banks loans and advances over customer deposits is funded with long term debt and equity.
The Investment Bank does not rely on customer deposit funding from Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management.
As at 31 December 2012, 112bn of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS and other similar schemes.
In addition to these customer deposits, there were 3bn of other liabilities insured by governments.
Although, contractually, current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice, the Groups broad base of customers numerically and by depositor type helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances.
Such accounts form a stable funding base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs.
Barclays models the behaviour of both assets and liabilities on a net cash flow basis using our experience of customer behaviour to assess balance sheet behaviouralised funding gaps under business as usual conditions.
These behavioural maturities are used to determine funds transfer pricing interest rates at which businesses are rewarded and charged for sources and uses of funds.

Term financing audited The Group continues to attract deposits in unsecured money markets and to raise additional secured and unsecured term funding in a variety of markets.
During 2012 the Group issued approximately 28bn of term funding, comprising: 3.4bn equivalent of public benchmark senior unsecured debt: 6.2bn equivalent of net privately placed senior unsecured debt: 16.8bn equivalent of secured debt: and 1.9bn of subordinated debt.
Included within secured funding issued during 2012 is 6bn of funding raised through participation in the Bank of Englands FLS.
Subordinated debt issued during 2012 comprises a Tier 2 issue of 1.9bn equivalent of contingent capital notes which includes a write-off feature should the Groups Core Tier 1 or CET1 capital, as appropriate, fall below 7%.
As previously disclosed, in addition to the above issuance, Euro funding gaps in Spain and Portugal were reduced through accessing 8.2bn of the European Central Banks three year LTRO in February 2012 see page 154 for more detail of Eurozone balance sheet redenomination risk.
Funding plan Barclays maintains a long term strategic funding plan, designed to reduce structural funding risk and optimise interest costs.
Total 2012 issuance was sufficient to cover the Groups needs for 2012 and also to pre-fund a large portion of the Groups needs for 2013.
The Groups needs in 2012 were significantly lower than the 27bn of term funding maturing in that year due to the improvement in the customer loan to deposit ratio and a reduction in legacy assets.
The Group has 18bn of term debt maturing in 2013 and a further 24bn maturing in 2014.
However, with expected deposit growth and reduction in legacy assets, funding needs are likely to be lower.
The Group continues to recognise the importance of a diversified funding base, and therefore monitors opportunities across a variety of funding markets.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 179 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued Encumbrance Asset encumbrance arises from collateral pledged against secured funding and other collateralised obligations.
Barclays funds a portion of trading portfolio assets and other securities via repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing and pledges a portion of customer loans and advances as collateral in securitisation, covered bond and other similar secured structures.
Barclays monitors the mix of secured and unsecured funding sources within the Groups funding plan and seeks to efficiently utilise available collateral to raise secured funding and meet other collateralised obligations.
Over the last 18 months the proportion of term funding requirements met with secured funding has increased, resulting in an increase in the encumbrance of loans and advances to customers.
We expect to moderately increase encumbrance of loans and advances to customers through additional term secured funding in the Groups Funding Plan, however, this is not expected to materially impact the overall proportion of assets that are encumbered.
As at 31 December 2012, only 231bn of the Groups balance sheet assets were encumbered excluding reverse repurchase agreements, which primarily related to firm financing of trading portfolio assets and other securities and to funding secured against loans and advances to customers.
In addition, 308bn of the total 359bn securities accepted as collateral, and held off-balance sheet, were on-pledged, the significant majority of which relates to matched-book activity where reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder relates primarily to reverse repurchases used to settle trading portfolio liabilities as well as collateral posted against derivatives margin requirements.

This includes cash and securities held in the Group liquidity pool as well as additional unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these additional assets are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
Unencumbered assets not classified as readily available for use as collateral consist primarily of derivatives and loans and advances to customers.
Loans and advances to customers are only classified as readily available if they are already in a form such that they can be used to raise funding without further management actions.
This includes excess collateral already in secured funding vehicles and collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available for use in secured financing transactions.
All other loans and advances are conservatively classified as not readily available, however a proportion would be suitable for use in secured funding structures.
Notes a Encumbered assets have been identified via the Groups assets pledged process.
For securities and commodities assets are considered encumbered if there has been legal title transfer against repurchase, stock lending and other similar secured borrowing agreements, trading portfolio liabilities or derivatives margin.
Encumbered loans and advances have been identified where assets are pledged against external securitisations or covered bonds or have been used in external repurchase or other similar agreements with market counterparts or central banks.
Additionally, encumbered assets include cash collateral posted.
Encumbered assets do not include assets which may have been pledged for other reasons and does not include client activity.

180 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Encumbrance of loans and advances Barclays issues ABS, covered bonds and other similar secured instruments that are secured primarily over customer loans and advances.
Notes issued from these programmes are also used in repurchase agreements with market counterparts and in central bank facilities.
Barclays also utilises loan collateral in central bank facilities in non-securitised form.
The Group currently manages four primary on balance sheet asset-backed funding programmes to obtain term financing for mortgage and credit card lending.
The UK regulated covered bond and the residential mortgage master trust securitisation programmes both utilise assets originated by the Groups UK residential mortgage business.
The other programmes are credit card master trust securitisations and use receivables from the Groups UK and US credit card businesses.
The programmes utilise true sale mechanics to transfer the title of the loan assets from Barclays Bank PLC BBPLC to insolvency remote special purpose vehicles.
These programmes initially transfer the respective assets by way of a beneficial transfer of the assets.
However, should there be a perfection event including, amongst other things, the insolvency of BBPLC or BBPLC not maintaining the appropriate credit rating required by the relevant rating agency, then legal transfer of the assets would occur.
As at 31 December 2012, 98bn of customer loans and advances were transferred to these and other asset backed funding programmes or utilised to secure funding from central bank facilities.
These assets were used to support 27bn of externally issued notes and a further 31bn of retained notes and non-securitised loan collateral used in repurchase agreements with market counterparts and at central bank facilities.
Inclusive of required  of 15bn, a total of 17% of total loans and advances to customers were used to secure external funding via these programmes.
In addition, as at 31 December 2012 the Group had 15bn of excess collateral within its asset backed funding programmes that can readily be used to raise additional secured funding and support future issuance.
A portion of retained notes are also available to raise secured funding.

The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by offsetting repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder are used to settle trading portfolio liabilities.
Due to the high quality of collateral provided against secured financing transactions, the liquidity risk associated with this activity is significantly lower than unsecured financing transactions.
Nonetheless, Barclays manages to gross and net secured mismatch limits to limit refinancing risk under a severe stress scenario and a portion of the Groups liquidity pool is held against stress outflows on these positions.
The Group secured mismatch limits are calibrated based on market capacity, liquidity characteristics of the collateral and risk appetite of the Group.
The cash value of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions will typically differ from the market value of the collateral against which these transactions are secured by an amount referred to as a haircut or .
Typical haircut levels vary depending on the quality of the e collateral that underlies these transactions.
For transactions secured against highly liquid collateral, lenders demand relatively small haircuts typically ranging from 0-2%.
For transactions secured against less liquid collateral, haircuts vary by asset class typically ranging from 5-10% for corporate bonds and other less liquid collateral.
As at 31 December 2012, the significant majority of repurchase activity related to matched-book activity.
The Group may face refinancing risk on the net maturity mismatch for matched-book activity.
However, 75% of matched-book activity is against highly liquid collateral and where against less liquid collateral net repurchase maturities are managed to longer-tenors.
Notes a Includes 3bn of cash reserves supporting secured funding vehicles.
b Comprised of bilateral repurchase agreements, collateral swaps and participation in central bank facilities.
c For mortgage loan collateral, assets reflects the value of collateral pledged and other secured funding reflects the liquidity value obtained.
d Primarily comprised of local authority covered bonds and export credit agency guaranteed loan collateral.

These ratings assess the credit worthiness of Barclays and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial attributes including risk management processes and procedures, capital strength, earnings, funding, liquidity, accounting and governance.
A credit rating downgrade could result in contractual outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts.
Outflows related to a multiple-notch credit rating downgrade are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk.
Credit ratings downgrades could also result in increased costs or reduced capacity to raise funding.

Barclays was fully reserving for maximum contractual outflows as a result of the ratings actions in the liquidity pool.
There has been no significant change in deposit funding or wholesale funding in relation to the rating actions.
Further credit rating downgrades could result in contractual outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts.

These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements.
These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity.
However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.

In addition to the Group liquidity pool, as at 31 December 2012, Absa Group held 4.6bn of liquidity pool assets against Absa-specific anticipated stressed outflows.
The liquidity pool consists of South African government bonds and Treasury bills.
The Absa loan to deposit ratio as at 31 December 2012 was 112% 2011: 115%.
The improvement in the loan to deposit ratio was driven by a reduction in loans and advances as a result of exchange rate movements combined with lower demand for credit across the South African economy in general, as well as a continued focus on ensuring that high credit standards continue to be applied.
Absa has also seen an increase in the term of customer deposits over the period.
As at 31 December 2012, Absa had 12bn of wholesale funding outstanding 2011: 15bn, of which 6bn matures in less than 12 months 2011: 9bn.
Issuance of term debt during 2012 included 0.5bn of senior unsecured debt and 0.4bn of subordinated debt, further extending the term and diversity of the funding base.
Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities audited Details of contractual maturities for assets and liabilities form an important source of information for the management of liquidity risk.
Such information is used among other things as the basis for modelling a behavioural balance sheet, for input into the liquidity framework, as discussed above.
The table below provides detail on the contractual maturity of all financial instruments and other assets and liabilities.
Derivatives other than those designated in a hedging relationship and trading portfolio assets and liabilities are included in the on demand column at their fair value.
Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for settlement according to such maturity and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value.
Derivatives designated in a hedging relationship are included according to their contractual maturity.
Financial assets designated at fair value in respect of linked liabilities to customers under investment contracts have been included in other assets and other liabilities as the Group is not exposed to liquidity risk arising from them: any request for funds from creditors would be met by simultaneously liquidating or transferring the related investment.
