Our performance in Latin America and Caribbean during the year demonstrated 2012 the strength and sustainability of our business.
In order to capture the consumer Latin America opportunity in the emerging middle class, we increased marketing spend to enhance our brand equities in scotch, increase the resonance of vodka and and Caribbean support innovation.
We enhanced our routes to market with more dedicated distributors in Brazil, a new distributor agreement in Costa Rica and a new supply distribution centre in Panama.
Additionally we have helped more than 12,000 people acquire vocational skills through our Learning for Life programme.
We finished the year with the exciting acquisition of Ypica, which will dramatically expand our presence in Brazil.
This sustained investment is building a strong and successful business.
