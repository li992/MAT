Highlights Highlights Highlights WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO The Berkeley Group Holdings plc Berkeley is a developer of residential-led mixed-use schemes, with a passion for delivering successful, sustainable places.
Berkeleys focus is on its core markets of London and the South East of England where its knowledge, experience and proven track record, with over thirty years of experience in this market, give it a competitive advantage in the planning and delivery of its schemes.
The business benets from a strong balance sheet and good visibility over performance in the near-term from cash due on forward sales of over 1 billion.
Berkeley will continue to forward sell its developments wherever possible, keeping financial risk low to mitigate the operating risks of delivery, and carefully allocating capital to the right projects at the right time, matching supply to demand wherever it can.
Berkeleys strategy is dedicated to delivering its long-term corporate objectives: To maximise shareholder value over the long-term in a sustainable and safe way, returning 13 per share to shareholders by 2021, and to remain one of the most successful and sustainable businesses in Britain.
