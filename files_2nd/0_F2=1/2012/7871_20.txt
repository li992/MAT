ENGINEERING ADVANTAGE LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
Dear shareholder It is often said that remuneration reports are too long and complicated to be understood.
There are many legal and best practice disclosure obligations that give rise to all these pages, but the challenge that I set myself this year was to tell you all you need to know about pay at IMI in one page.
Here it is: What did the executive directors get paid in 2012?
Annual Vesting of 2009 Vesting of 2009 Gain on Value Value of incentive performance share share matching vesting of Salary of pension for 2012 plan award plan award options under paid benets allowance results excluding excluding 2009 Share 000 000 000 000 dividends dividends Option Plan M J Lamb 740 34 259 524 285,800 shares 655,841 shares n a D M Hurt 405 27 142 238 156,800 shares 166,171 shares n a S Toomes 330 206 116 174 n a 59,249 shares 377,613 R M Twite 405 26 142 222 148,100 shares 139,313 shares n a S Toomes received Share Option Plan awards during 2009 prior to his executive director appointment.
The gain of the vesting is calculated using the grant price and closing price on vesting.
Ian Whiting ceased to be an executive director and employee on 22 August 2012 and therefore is not included in the table above.
He had a contract with a 12 month notice period and the termination arrangements reected that but did not include any bonus in respect of the part of 2012 he had worked or the notice period.
All of his outstanding and unvested share awards lapsed, except the 2009 share options and the 2010 matching share award which will vest in full during his notice period.
Further details of the termination arrangements are described in section 8 of the following report.
S Toomes resigned as an executive director on 6 March 2013 and his employment will terminate on 30 June 2013.
S Toomes remuneration for 2012 is included in the table above.
The 2012 annual bonus was earned for performance against a pre-set range of targets of: profit before tax: adjusted EPS: organic revenue growth: cash conversion: and a range of non-financial measures including health and safety measures, compliance with the IMI Way and specic personal objectives.
As you have read, IMI has performed well against some, but not all of these measures.
The 2009 performance share plan awards shown above vested because IMIs total shareholder return TSR over three years was 124%.
This was a clear demonstration of pay for performance as it is above the upper quartile benchmark of the comparator companies of 87%.
In May 2012 we granted performance share plan and matching share plan awards in line with our normal policy.
These awards will vest in May 2015 depending on the executives continued employment at that time and to the extent that EVA, adjusted EPS growth, relative TSR and organic revenue growth targets are met.
Full payment requires outstanding performance against all four of these measures.
What did the non-executive directors get paid in 2012?
The Chairman, Roberto Quarta was paid a fee of 250,000.
Each non-executive director received an annualised base fee of 52,500.
I received an additional 10,000 for chairing the Remuneration Committee.
Terry Gateley was paid an incremental fee of 15,000 for chairing the Audit Committee and for being the senior independent director.
These extra fees reect the greater time commitment of these roles.
The non-executive directors do not receive annual bonuses or participate in the share plans.
Consistent with the approach we have taken across the whole Group, the salaries of the current executive directors have increased on average by 2.6%.
The base fee for non-executive directors has been increased to 55,000, the first change for three years.
The additional fee for chairing each of the Remuneration and Audit Committees will be 15,000 reecting how the responsibilities have increased over the past three years.
We are maintaining the structure of the annual bonus plan and the long term incentive share plans in respect of the 2013 awards for executive directors.
We will be undertaking a detailed review of our incentive arrangements during this year to ensure alignment with our strategic goals and we will present our proposals in next years report.
In 2012 our average employee salary increase was 2.8%.
A total of 1.6 million share options vested in 2012 these were granted in 2009 to 157 managers and the average gain per share option on vesting was 4.19.
We continue to offer all employee share plans and as at 31 December 2012, 22% of our employees are participants and or shareholders.
We believe strongly in employee share ownership and aim to increase participation over time.
There it is, all on one page.
I hope you will continue to take an interest in remuneration at IMI and will approve this report at the annual general meeting.
Thank you, Bob Stack Board reports 48
