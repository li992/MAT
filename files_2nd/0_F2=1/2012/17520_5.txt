com 11 Key performance indicators continued Non-financial key performance indicators Our Board regularly monitors a range of non-financial KPIs to assess the Groups performance against sustainable development targets and strategic objectives.
These non-financial KPIs are considered alongside our financial performance against a range of stated objectives.
Our industry-leading Sustainable Development SD Framework, which provides guidance on how we implement, review and improve our management of sustainability across the organisation, is set and overseen by our Board.
Our SD Framework has been mapped to international standards, and comprises our Statement of Business Principles, SD Policy and SD Standards and Assurance Programme.
Our management model is highly devolved, and each commodity business is responsible for the implementation of our SD Framework across their operations.
They review and evaluate their performance against the SD Framework every quarter and report progress to our Board Health, Safety, Environment and Community HSEC Committee.
The HSEC Committee benchmarks our performance against other mining and extractive sector companies.
The non-financial KPIs within the SD Framework relate to safety, environmental incidents, water and energy usage, employee turnover, training, and support for community initiatives.
Progress is reported regularly to our Board, Executive Committee and senior management.
Our internal audit and assurance programme examines health, safety, environmental, ethical and community risks.
Safety injury frequency rate We believe that every work-related incident, illness and injury is preventable and we are committed to providing a safe workplace.
It is with regret that we report that five people three contractors and two employees lost their lives at our managed operations in 2012 2011: six people.
We do not distinguish between contractors and employees: the safety of all our workers is of equal and paramount importance.
We insist that our contractors comply fully with our safety standards and procedures, and monitor their compliance.
All our sites hold regular and appropriate behaviour-based training with particular emphasis on identifying and managing major hazards.
Our managers work with their supervisors and field operators to identify appropriate topics to be covered in daily team talks and safety training.
We track lost time injuries and also total recordable Total recordable injury frequency rate injuries, which is a broader measure including per million hours worked lost time injuries, medical treatment injuries and 8.0 restricted work injuries, for our total workforce, including contractors.
We track frequency rates 6.0 7.0 for both these measures per million hours worked.
We use the information measured to continuously 4.0 5.2 improve related performance.
Safety, our initiatives 4.4 and our performance, is discussed at every 2.0 Executive Committee and Board HSEC meeting.

The total recordable injuries rate fell by 15% and the Lost time injury frequency rate lost time injury rate was 15% lower than in 2011. per million hours worked 2.0 1.9 1.5 1.0 1.3 1.1 0.5 0.0 10 11 12 Environmental incidents We grade environmental incidents according to severity.
Category 1 represents very minor incidents with negligible impact.
Category 3 incidents cause moderate, reversible environmental impact and require moderate remediation.
Categories 4 and 5 represent major or disastrous incidents with medium-to longer-term impacts respectively.
We aim for zero category 3, 4 and 5 incidents.
This target was achieved for a third consecutive year in 2012.
com Greenhouse gases COe mt 2 Greenhouse gas GHG emissions are measured as CO equivalent COe tonnes.
Electricity usage, methane released during coal mining 2 2 in some regions and post mining fugitive methane emissions from our closed coal operations represent our main sources of GHG emissions.
During 2012, we recorded 13.9 million tonnes of scope 1, direct, emissions and 8.1 million tonnes of scope 2 emissions, or indirect, a 1% increase and 2% decrease on the previous year.
We are seeking to reduce these GHG emissions through improved energy efficiency and, where possible, by capturing coal-seam methane to generate power.

Efficiency and energy consumption reductions drive both cost savings and emissions reductions.
Many of our operations use energy intensively and energy use is a significant component of our total operation costs.
As such, we aim to continually improve energy efficiency across our operations.
Our commodity businesses have bespoke energy efficiency plans and regular energy audits are carried out.

com 13 Dir Indir gy gy Key performance indicators continued Water Megalitres Large volumes of water are used in the extraction and processing of minerals and metals.
Many of our operations are located in arid regions, making effective water management and conservation critical.
We have endorsed the United Nations CEO Water Mandate, publicly recognising that we have a responsibility to make water resources management a priority.
We are working with governments, non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders to address the global water challenge.
We monitor total water used and water recycled.
Our operations have an ongoing responsibility to increase the use of processed and recycled wastewater in order to reduce our impact on local water supplies.
Recycled water is predominantly used in place of fresh water for processes such as dust suppression.
Each site has in place a bespoke water management programme, tailored to specific activities and local environmental conditions.
The 6% reduction in water withdrawals in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to changes in production processes at Xstrata Nickel and Xstrata Zinc.
We are continuously striving to improve our ability to measure total Total water withdrawn water reused and recycled consistently and across all businesses.
Megalitres This was a key area of focus in 2012, and we aim to disclose more 300,000 information on this metric going forward.
