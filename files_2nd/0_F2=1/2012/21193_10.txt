Annual report and accounts 2012 Selected consolidated financial data This data is derived from our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and as endorsed by the European Union EU.
In December 2012 the Group announced the sale of its US Life and related internal asset management operations, which have been classified as held for sale in the statement of financial position and their results shown as discontinued operations.
The results presented as discontinued operations for 2011 and preceding years also include the results of Delta Lloyd N. V. which was deconsolidated during 2011.
Between May 2011 and July 2012 Delta Lloyd was accounted for as an associate within continuing operations.
In July 2012, following a further sell-down, the Groups shareholding fell below 20% and from July 2012 Delta Lloyd was treated as a financial investment within continuing operations at fair value through profit and loss.
Following a review of the classification of contracts issued by the Italian Life business, certain portfolios have been reclassified from participating insurance to participating investment contracts.
This change has been reflected for all years in the table below.
There is no impact on the result for any period as the result of this reclassification.
