Business Review Governance Financial Statements Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2012 Business Review Experts in The Essentials 1 In 2008 we launched the Operational Excellence Agenda to address a range of operational and financial issues across the group.
Our focus was to restore operational effectiveness to enable us to compete at the highest level in all our markets.
Over the last five years we have pursued this agenda through five strategic thrusts - customer service & care, developing capability, operational excellence, cost savings and cash delivery and growth.
Today, we have achieved much of what we planned most of the basic restructuring and process design has been completed, freeing us to focus on growth and innovation.
While there is still more to do, this on-going transformation of our business has been made possible by the dedication, hard work and commitment of our people.
