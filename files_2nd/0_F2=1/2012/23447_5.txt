During this time the firm has invested in excess of 3 billion, accumulated considerable expertise and has built a strong track record.
As at 30 September 2012, Electra Partners had funds under management of over 1.3 billion on behalf of Electra and other clients.
With one of the most experienced and stable teams in the private equity industry, the majority of the senior management have worked together for over 20 years.
The investment professionals have on average over 15 years experience in private equity and are supported by a 23-strong team skilled in finance, compliance, investor relations and marketing.

Despite this, the aggregate value of new investments was greater than in 2011 and we remain committed to ensuring that all new acquisitions provide attractive returns and appropriately reflect the uncertainties ahead.
With Electras flexible investment mandate and ability to invest across the capital structure in both debt and equity positions, we expect that the number of new opportunities will rise over the next 18 months and deliver an increase in completed new investments.
Electra made good progress in the last financial year against a backdrop of a difficult economy and a private equity market experiencing a decline in overall activity.
Excellent disposals were achieved and the portfolio is well positioned for further growth.
Market Environment The private equity market continues to be negatively impacted by the current financial issues which have led to reduced activity in the M&A markets.
Deal volumes have fallen steadily over the past year reflecting not only the decline in market activity but also the lack of availability of debt finance on suitable terms.
On the other hand the surplus of private equity funds, which has also been a factor in the market for a number of years, is beginning to decline as fundraising and investment becomes more in line and commitments made in earlier years begin to lapse.
This should lead to an improvement in the market in respect of the balance between supply and demand.
Performance Despite the uncertainties in the economy and the private equity marketplace, Electras net asset value has continued to make positive progress with gains arising equally from realisations of investments and from unrealised appreciation in respect of the retained portfolio.
Over the year, Electras fully diluted net asset value per share increased to 2,473p compared to 2,225p at the beginning of the year.
This 248p increase in the net asset value per share represents a percentage increase over the year of 11% compared to a 13% increase in the FTSE All-Share over the same period.
The total return from the investment portfolio over the year amounted to 157 million of which 87 million arose in the first half of the year and 70 million in the second half.
The total return of 157 million is stated before deducting 21 million of adverse currency movements on translation into sterling.
So far as the net asset value is concerned these currency movements were partially offset by 11 million of currency gains on the loans of 154 million drawn down for hedging purposes.

Our stance towards new investment however has remained cautious.
In our view pricing levels anticipated by vendors have often not reflected the present uncertainties particularly in respect of the visibility of future earnings.
During the year we have restricted investments to those situations where we consider that the entry prices have been appropriately discounted.
Total investment for the year amounted to 150 million.
Realisations from the portfolio during the year have been substantial as we have been While activity in the private able to take advantage of the market situation.
Proceeds amounted to 301 million equity market has slowed 15 million more than the total of realisations achieved over the two previous years.
in recent months, Electra because of its flexible Outlook mandate continues to While activity in the private equity market has slowed in recent months, Electra because experience a good level of of its flexible mandate continues to experience a good level of investment opportunities.
This robust dealflow, together with the belief that prices will fall further as uncertainty in the European economy continues, should lead to an increase in the investment rate within a relatively short time period.
This will allow replenishment of a maturing portfolio from which further growth is anticipated.
