Business model Our business model involves exploring for, developing, mining and delivering coal efficiently, from assets with long lives and advantaged cost positions to growing Asian markets.
There are four key elements to our business model: We have access to a large coal mining concession in East Kalimantan, close to the coast in an inherently low cost location.
An important component of our license to operate is our performance in health, safety, the environment and community affairs.
Throughout the life of our mines we remain committed to our corporate social responsibilities, looking to minimise the environmental impact of our operations, ensure the safety and well-being of our staff and provide employment opportunities for local people.
We plan and manage the development of our mines, ensuring that investment programmes are value accretive for shareholders and are funded based on an appropriate capital structure and a sustainable cost of borrowing.
We use a number of contractors to remove the overburden, mine the coal and deliver it for shipment.
The use of contractors enables us to use capital efficiently, spread our mining risk profile and provide flexibility in mining activities.
We aim to maximise the value of sales by blending different grades of coal to provide product specifications that are required by our customers and we use marketing agents to ensure we receive a competitive price for our products.
Based on this business model, we aim to become a leading UK listed Asian resources company, with world class mining assets delivering superior returns over the long term.
Strategy Following the decision to dispose of its interest in PT Bumi, the Companys strategy is to focus on PT Berau which has a 118,400 hectare concession with over 2 billion tonnes of reserves and resources in East Kalimantan and mining operations in the lower half of the cost curve.
The key components of the Company strategy are: Optimisation.
The Company has significantly cut costs through revisions to the mine plan in the latter part of 2012 and will be driving further operational efficiencies through the launch of an external benchmarking study.
PT Berau is focused on profitably growing the business organically and is targeting to increase production in the near term from 21 mt in 2012 to 30 mt.
The Company is conducting a major review of capital expenditure required to support this growth including road improvements and bridges, and the acquisition of crushers and other processing equipment and supporting infrastructure.
In particular, investments in crushers at Binungan, improvements to stockpile facility at Sambarata and road improvements across all mining areas.
The Company is reviewing the capital structure with a view to reducing its interest cost.
