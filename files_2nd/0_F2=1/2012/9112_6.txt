14 OUR BUSINESS MODEL VALUE CHAIN FLEXIBILITY Providing valuable services to clients throughout the life of a project.
Having the capability to provide a wide range of services can mean a greater and longer involvement in any individual project.
Kentz operates through three global business units where it provides a broad range of services to clients in the energy and resources sectors.
Advantage The greatest benefit of this for Kentz is the multiple entry points this allows into a project, which can afford the Group the opportunity to provide one client with services from all three of our business units, or alternatively, the identication of specic parts of the value chain where we can focus business winning efforts.
As some of our services are concentrated on the early stages of a project, the project personnel often have a clear insight into the clients future needs where they can identify an additional service offering for any of ourbusiness units.
This aids the collaboration of our business units and provides our clients with a one-team approach to providing solutions in the development of their project.
Through its three business units, Kentz often has the opportunity for bidding on multiple contracts within a project.
The loss of one contract bid does not mean that Kentz is precluded from working on the project in delivering other scopes of work.
Having the capability to provide a wide range of services can mean a greater and longer involvement in anyindividual project.
