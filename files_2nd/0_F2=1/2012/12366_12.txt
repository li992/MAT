Precious metals The precious metals price dynamics in 2012 were mixed, and continued to be largely driven by investment demand.
The continued monetary easing in the US and Europe, as well as uncertainty over the future of the Eurozone, were the main drivers moderately pushing the gold price up in the first nine months of the year to a high of US$1,790 oz recorded in the beginning of October, although there was significant volatility in gold prices in the middle of the year.
Subsequently, the gold price went down on the back of improving macroeconomic statistics from the US which triggered doubts over the continuation of the quantitative easing policy of the Federal Reserve.
As a result, the average gold price in 2012 was US$1,668 oz, up 6% compared to 2011.
Silver price dynamics generally followed gold, also displaying significant volatility during the year.
However the average price level of US$31.1 oz was 12% lower year-on-year after abnormal spikes in 2011.
The average gold silver price ratio decreased from 45 1 in 2011 to 54 1 in 2012, a level close to the long-term average.
Foreign exchange The Groups revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, while the majority of the Groups costs are denominated in Russian Roubles.
Therefore changes in exchange rates are affecting its financial results and performance.
Both year-end and average RUB US$ exchange rates have decreased during the year, resulting in moderate strengthening of the Rouble against US Dollar.
The average rate decreased by 3%, from 31.88 RUB US$ in 2011 to 31.09 RUB US$ in 2012.
The year-end rate was 30.37 RUB US$, representing a 6% strengthening compared to the beginning of the year.
During the year the exchange rate was subject to a greater volatility, with a significant Rouble strengthening in the first quarter, followed then by depreciation in the second quarter with lowest level of 34.04 RUB US$ in June.
In the second half of the year, the Rouble strengthening resumed, driven by tight liquidity conditions and stable oil prices.
