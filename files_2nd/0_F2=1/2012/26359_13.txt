Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 44 45 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 suMMARY OF GROuP REsulTs Overview The Group delivered a significantly improved performance in 2012, in a continued challenging economic and regulatory environment.
We have substantially increased Group underlying profit and delivered strong returns in excess of the cost of equity in the core business, while further strengthening our balance sheet and delivering significant reductions in costs and risk.
Our statutory results for the year were however affected by further provisions for contact and redress costs in relation to legacy PPi business and iRHP sales to small and medium-sized businesses, and also included 3,207 million of gains from sales of government securities.
Significantly improved Group underlying profitability We reported a Group underlying profit before tax of 2,607 million, an increase of 1,969 million, with another strong performance from the core business at 6,154 million 2011: 6,196 million and a reduction of 2,011 million in non-core losses to 3,547 million.
This was driven by continued improvement in asset quality and further progress on our simplification programme, which resulted in, respectively, a substantial improvement in the impairment charge, down 42 per cent to 5,697 million, and a further reduction in total costs of 5 per cent to 10,082 million.
These improvements more than offset an expected reduction in underlying income, down 13 per cent to 18,386 million, due mainly to a decline in net interest margin, further non-core asset reductions and continued subdued demand for lending and customer deleveraging.
Returns increased in the core business in our core business, the return on risk-weighted assets improved 10 basis points to 2.56 per cent, and underlying profit was broadly stable at 6,154 million 2011: 6,196 million.
core total costs reduced 5 per cent to 9,212 million as a result of further simplification savings, and the impairment charge decreased 34 per cent to 1,919 million driven primarily by continued improvement in the quality of our portfolios.
These effects broadly offset a reduction of 8 per cent in underlying income which reflected expected continued subdued lending demand and customer deleveraging, as well as a decline in core net interest margin of 10 basis points year-on-year.
This decline was mainly a result of higher wholesale funding costs, but was mitigated throughout the year by the benefit of repricing certain lending portfolios and further improvements to the funding mix.
Further substantial non-core asset reduction and lower non-core losses We delivered a further substantial reduction in non-core assets of 42.3 billion 30 per cent in 2012, significantly ahead of our original guidance for the year, resulting in a remaining non-core asset portfolio of 98.4 billion.
The percentage reduction in risk weighted assets on the portfolio was in line with that of non-core assets.
continued high wholesale funding costs were the main driver behind a reduction in the non-core margin of 46 basis points to 0.55 per cent.
Given a substantial improvement in the impairment charge, which reduced by 45 per cent to 3,778 million, and a further 7 per cent cost reduction, the non-core business delivered a reduced underlying loss of 3,547 million 2011: 5,558 million.
Management and statutory results Management profit, which includes the effects of asset sales, liability management, volatile items and fair value unwind was 4,827 million, an increase of 2,142 million or 80 per cent compared to 2011.
This included a profit on government bond sales of 3,207 million 2011: 196 million as a result of our active management of our balance sheet in response to the low interest rate environment, and a positive fair value unwind of 650 million, partly offset by a loss on asset sales of 660 million, charges for own debt volatility of 270 million, and other volatility of 478 million.
The statutory loss before tax of 570 million included provisions of 3,575 million in relation to legacy PPi business and 400 million in relation to iRHP sales to small and medium sized business.
charges relating to simplification amounted to 676 million, while costs relating to the Ec mandated retail business disposal Verde totalled 570 million.
The loss after tax was 1,343 million, with a tax charge of 773 million.
This tax charge reflects a policyholder tax charge arising from the revaluation of policyholder tax credits in the light of current economic forecasts and recent changes to the taxation of life insurance companies and the impact of the announced reduction in uK corporation tax rate to 23 per cent on the net deferred tax asset.
Balance sheet further strengthened: remain confident in our capital position We continue to make good progress in strengthening our balance sheet, further improving our core tier 1 capital ratio by 1.2 per cent to 12.0 per cent by the end of 2012.
The total capital ratio improved from 15.6 per cent at the end of 2011 to 17.3 per cent, which already exceeds the independent commission on Bankings icB primary loss-absorbing capacity PlAc recommendations.
Our fully loaded core tier 1 ratio increased by 1 per cent to 8.1 per cent.
We continued to reduce risk in the balance sheet, achieving a significant non-core asset reduction and completing the transformation of our funding position.
We remain confident in our capital position given our strongly capital generative core business and the capital accretive non-core asset reduction achieved in the year.
The non-core asset reduction and further deposit growth of 4 per cent excluding repos also allowed us to further transform our funding position in 2012, with the core loan to deposit ratio of 101 per cent at the end of 2012 now very close to our long-term target of 100 per cent.
The total amount of Group wholesale funding reduced by 32 per cent to 169.6 billion at the end of 2012 from 251.2 billion at the end of 2011, and its maturity profile was further improved, with wholesale funding with a maturity of less than one year reduced to less than 30 per cent of total wholesale funding at the end of 2012, down from 45 per cent at the end of 2011.
Our liquidity position remains strong, with a primary liquid asset portfolio of 87.6 billion.
The total liquid asset portfolio of 205 billion represents approximately four times our wholesale funding with a maturity of less than one year at the end of 2012, providing a substantial buffer in the event of market dislocation.

in the first half of 2012 the Asset Finance business, previously reported within Wholesale, was transferred to the Wealth, Asset Finance and international division.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Groups Wholesale and commercial divisions were combined to form the new commercial Banking division.
The Groups European and Australian wholesale business has also been transferred from Wealth, Asset Finance and international to commercial Banking.
comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
We continue to simplify our reporting and this is the last time we will report management profit as a separate item.
Going forward our reporting will focus on underlying and statutory profit.
in addition, impairment charges directly related to asset sales are now included in the asset sales line.
Total underlying income Group Core 2012 2011 change 2012 2011 change m m % m m % net interest income 10,335 12,210 15 9,868 10,893 9 Other income 8,416 9,179 8 7,782 8,215 5 insurance claims 365 343 6 365 343 6 Total underlying income 18,386 21,046 13 17,285 18,765 8 Banking net interest margin 1.93% 2.07% 14 bp 2.32% 2.42% 10 bp Average interest-earning banking assets 543.3bn 585.4bn 7 423.7bn 438.7bn 3 loan to deposit ratio 121% 135% 14 pp 101% 109% 8 pp Total underlying income for the year decreased 13 per cent to 18,386 million, principally reflecting the effects on the core business of continued subdued lending and customer deleveraging, and further asset reductions in the non-core business.
Trends in total underlying income were more stable in the second half of the year, as the effect on non-core income from the reduction of non-core assets was broadly offset by core income growth which, having reduced by 5 per cent in the first half of 2012, increased by 2 per cent in the second half.
Group income Group net interest income for the year fell by 15 per cent to 10,335 million due to lower asset balances and a decline in margin.
Average interest-earning banking assets fell 7 per cent, mainly due to further non-core asset reductions, while the banking net interest margin reduced 14 basis points to 1.93 per cent, due to competitive deposit markets and higher wholesale funding costs continuing into 2012, with the average cost of new funding continuing to be higher than the average cost of maturing funds.
These effects were partly mitigated by the benefits of re-pricing certain lending portfolios, an improving funding mix, and the reduction in lower margin non-core banking assets.
A reduction in other income of 8 per cent to 8,416 million was mainly driven by lower expected returns in the insurance business and low customer confidence affecting sales of insurance products.
in addition, fee income in Asset Finance and international was lower, while managed reduction in the balance sheet also reduced fees and commissions.
Core income The reduction in core net interest income of 9 per cent to 9,868 million reflected the 3 per cent decrease in core average interest-earning banking assets, and a 10 basis point decline in banking net interest margin which was a result of continued elevated funding costs.
The decline in core assets slowed in the second half, with customer loans and advances down by 3.2 billion compared with a reduction of 8.5 billion in the first half.
The core net interest margin was stable throughout the year.
core other income reduced by 5 per cent, reflecting lower expected returns in the insurance business, and reduced sales of insurance products.

This is two years ahead of the plan we set out in our 2011 strategic Review and an absolute reduction in the cost base of around 1 billion since 2010, despite inflation and increased investment in the core business.
Overview Business review Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 46 47 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 suMMARY OF GROuP REsulTs core total costs reduced by 5 per cent driven by the benefits of our simplification programme, partly offset by inflationary pressures and increased investment in the business, while in the non-core business, the reduction of 7 per cent was mainly a result of a smaller non-core portfolio.
The charge to the Group in respect of the Financial services compensation scheme costs was 175 million 2011: 179 million.
The Bank levy was 179 million 2011: 189 million, in spite of an increase in the rate of the levy, as a consequence of the lower levels of wholesale funding a reduction in the Groups balance sheet and an increase in the proportion of funding with a maturity of greater than one year.
As at 31 december 2012, we had realised annual run rate savings of 847 million from our initiatives to simplify the Group, an increase of 605 million since 31 december 2011, with the simplification programme contributing in year cost savings of 774 million in 2012. since the start of the programme 18 months ago, we have made strong progress in our simplification programme, with over 200 improvements delivered.
We continue to simplify our business operations through streamlining and improving customer processes, reducing management layers and increasing spans of control as well as restructuring business units.
The latter includes consolidation of back office operations sites, optimisation of our model for delivery of iT and outsourcing of our property facilities and asset management services.
These improvements are also contributing to improved customer service and significant reductions in customer complaints excluding PPi.
Given the good progress we have made in the delivery of the simplification programme in restructuring, simplifying and improving processes, we remain on track to meet our increased run rate target of 1.9 billion by the end of 2014.
This compares with the original target of 1.7 billion announced in June 2011 as part of our strategic Review.
We are now also targeting a reduction in Group total costs to around 9.8 billion in 2013. impairment impairment charge impairment charge as a % of average advances 2012 2011 change 2012 2011 m m % % % core 1,919 2,887 34 0.44 0.64 non-core 3,778 6,900 45 3.08 4.60 Total impairment 5,697 9,787 42 1.02 1.62 We continue to improve asset quality through the ongoing application of our conservative credit risk appetite, strong risk management controls and fide-risking of our portfolios.
This resulted in a reduction in the Group impairment charge of 42 per cent to 5,697 million.
The overall performance of the portfolio continues to improve and benefits from low interest rates and broadly stable uK residential property prices, partly offset by the subdued uK economy, the weak commercial real estate market, and high, although reducing, unemployment.
Core impairment The core impairment charge of 1,919 million was 34 per cent lower than the charge in 2011, primarily driven by better performance in Retail, which reduced by 34 per cent to 1,192 million, and commercial Banking, which reduced by 33 per cent to 704 million.
The reduction in Retail was mainly driven by a reduction in the unsecured charge driven by our sustainable approach to risk, reduced balances and effective portfolio management, while the secured portfolio also saw a lower charge as a result of a fall in impaired loans.
Within commercial Banking the fall in core impairment charge was primarily attributable to lower impairments in some core portfolios, including Mid Markets, corporate and sME.
in Mid Markets and corporate, there were specific large impairments in these portfolios in 2011, which were not repeated in 2012.
The core impairment charge as a percentage of average advances improved to 0.44 per cent, remaining better than our long-term target for the Group as a whole.
non-core impairment The non-core impairment charge of 3,778 million was 45 per cent lower than the charge in 2011, driven by material reductions of 29 per cent to 2,242 million in the commercial Banking charge, and of 60 per cent to 1,321 million in the international charge.
in commercial Banking, non-core impairments decreased, particularly in the Australasian and Acquisition Finance portfolios, partly offset by further deterioration in the shipping portfolio as a result of a weak market.
in international, the impairment charge reduction was largely as a result of lower charges in the irish business.
non-core loans and advances to customers accounted for 72 per cent of the Groups impaired loans and had a coverage ratio of 51 per cent at 31 december 2012 31 december 2011: 48 per cent.

This incorporates the effects of asset sales, liability management, volatile items and fair value unwind.

The Groups management profit has been affected by our active management of the balance sheet position in response to the low interest rate environment and the reduction in wholesale funding spreads seen in 2012.
The profit from asset sales of 2,547 million primarily relates to 3,207 million gains from sales of Government securities, as the Group has taken the opportunity afforded by the continuing low yields on these securities to rebalance and reduce the level of these holdings.
Also included are losses from asset disposals of 1,349 million, principally relating to the run-down of the non-core portfolios, partially offset by a related fair value unwind of 689 million.
liability management losses of 229 million arose on transactions undertaken as part of the Groups management of wholesale funding and capital, including a loss of 397 million in the second half resulting from debt repurchases and a gain of 168 million relating to the exchange of certain capital securities for other subordinated debt instruments in the first half.
Own debt volatility of 270 million is primarily driven by a charge relating to the change in fair value of the small proportion of the Groups wholesale funding which was designated at fair value at inception, and which reflects the tightening in credit spreads in the second half of 2012.
This was partly offset by a positive impact relating to the change in fair value of the equity conversion feature of the Enhanced capital notes.
Other volatile items include the change in fair value of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange hedges in the banking book not mitigated through hedge accounting, reflecting the volatile market conditions in the period, and a positive net derivative valuation adjustment.
Management profit also includes a gain of 650 million relating to an unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments.
The unwind of fair value relating to assets disposed of in the period is included in the asset sales line.
Statutory loss statutory loss before tax was 570 million in 2012.
Management profit was offset by provisions relating to legacy PPi business totalling 3,575 million, other regulatory provisions of 650 million, and other charges totalling 1,172 million.
Further detail on the reconciliation to management and statutory results is included in note 4 on page 233.

These costs related to severance, iT and business costs of implementation.
FTE role reductions of 4,892 were announced in 2012 taking the total to 6,990 since the start of the programme.
simplification of our business operations continues through reduction in management layers and increasing spans of control as well as restructuring business units.
The latter includes consolidation of back office operations sites, optimisation of our iT delivery model and outsourcing of our property facilities and asset management services.
costs relating to the Ec mandated business disposal in 2012 were 570 million and from inception to date total 782 million costs in the year ended 31 december 2011: 170 million.
Payment protection insurance provision The Group has had further experience of PPi complaint volumes, uphold rates and operational and redress costs since the announcement of our third quarter 2012 interim Management statement.
As a consequence, we have made a further provision of 1,500 million in the fourth quarter, which brings the amount provided for PPi in 2012 to 3,575 million, and the total amount provided to 6,775 million.
Total costs incurred to the end of 2012 were 4,344 million, including approximately 700 million of related administration costs.
The net volume of PPi complaints and costs of contact and redress continue to trend downwards.
complaints received in the fourth quarter of 2012 were approximately 20 per cent lower than the preceding quarter, and around 30 per cent lower than the second quarter of 2012.
The average monthly spend for the fourth quarter of 2012 was approximately 200 million, a reduction of approximately 25 per cent on the third quarter.
While uncertainty remains, we expect the average monthly spend to reduce further in the first half of 2013, by broadly 20 per cent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, before further reducing in the second half of the year.
Other regulatory matters in June 2012, a number of banks, including lloyds Banking Group, reached agreement with the Financial services Authority FsA to carry out a thorough assessment of iRHP sales made since 1 december 2001 to certain small and medium sized businesses.
The Group agreed that, on conclusion of this review, it would provide redress to any of these customers where appropriate.
At that time the total cost was not expected to be material.
Given the agreement with the FsA reached on 30 January 2013 following the outcome of a pilot review of iRHP sales to small and medium-sized businesses, the Group now believes it is appropriate to increase its provision for iRHP by 310 million, based on revised estimates of redress and related administration costs.
The provision in relation to iRHP now totals 300 million for the cost of redress and 100 million for related administration costs, all of which was accounted for in 2012.
At the end of 2012, only 20 million of the original provision had been utilised.
We have received a number of claims in the German courts relating to policies issued by clerical Medical investment Group limited, principally during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and recognised an additional provision of 150 million in respect of this litigation in the third quarter of 2012, taking the total provision to 325 million.
The Group has also taken a provision of 100 million for potential redress and other costs relating to uK Retail and other legacy conduct of business issues.
Further detail on these matters is contained in note 44 on page 278 of this annual report.
interbank offered rate setting investigations We continue to co-operate with investigations by government agencies in the uK, us and overseas into submissions made to the bodies that set various interbank offered rates.
in addition the Group, together with other panel banks, has been named in private lawsuits in the us including with regard to the setting of BBA london interbank offered rates.
it is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome of the various regulatory investigations or private lawsuits, including the timing and scale of the potential impact of any investigations and private lawsuits on the Group.
Past service pensions credit As previously disclosed at the 2012 Half-Year Results, following a review of policy in respect of discretionary pension increases in relation to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, increases in certain schemes are now linked to the consumer Price index rather than the Retail Price index.
The effect of this change is a reduction in the Groups defined benefit obligation of 250 million, the benefit of which has been recognised in the Groups income statement in 2012. volatility arising in insurance businesses The Groups statutory result before tax is affected by insurance volatility, caused by movements in financial markets, and policyholder interests volatility, which primarily reflects the gross up of policyholder tax included in the Group tax charge.
in 2012 the Groups statutory result before tax included positive insurance and policyholder interests volatility totalling 306 million compared to negative volatility of 838 million in 2011.
Further detail is given on pages 74 and 75.
Taxation The tax charge for 2012 was 773 million.
This represents a greater tax burden than that implied by the uK statutory rate.
This is primarily due to a policyholder tax charge of 583 million arising from the revaluation of policyholder tax credits in the light of current economic forecasts and recent changes to the taxation of life insurance companies.
An additional 308 million of the tax charge results from the impact of the announced reduction in uK corporation tax rate to 23 per cent on the net deferred tax asset.

This increase was principally driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets of 42.0 billion, mainly driven by the non-core reduction, and the contribution from management profit, partly offset by statutory items and tax costs.
The total capital ratio at 31 december 2012 improved to 17.3 per cent 31 december 2011: 15.6 per cent, which is already in excess of the independent commission Bankings icB primary loss-absorbing capacity PlAc recommendations.
When applying the draft July 2011 cRd iV rules on both transitional and fully loaded bases, the Groups pro forma common equity tier 1 cET1 capital ratios would have been 11.6 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively as at 31 december 2012.
The pro forma capital resources are based on our interpretation of the draft July 2011 cRd iV rules with risk-weighted assets estimates updated to reflect the Groups best expectation of how these rules will be amended for subsequent Basel announcements and Eu discussions.
Our calculation now includes a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the expected favourable resolution of the definition of corporate exceptions from derivative valuation adjustments and of changes to the definition of default for retail mortgages.
in addition, if the alternative treatment was allowed under cRd iV in relation to insurance holdings, we believe this would increase the fully loaded pro forma cRd iV cET1 ratio by approximately 1.0 per cent assuming application of the July 2011 text.

in 2012, we achieved a substantial reduction of 42.3 billion in the non-core portfolio, resulting in the portfolio at 31 december 2012 amounting to 98.4 billion.
The reduction continues to be managed in a capital efficient manner, and was capital accretive in 2012. it included reductions of 14 billion in treasury assets, 6 billion in uK commercial real estate and 9 billion in international assets of which 4 billion was in ireland and 2 billion in Australasia.
The 33 per cent fall in non-core risk-weighted assets over the last year is in line with the 30 per cent of asset reductions achieved and reflects the substantial decrease in risk we have achieved over this period.
We continue to expect our non-core assets to reduce to 70 billion or less by the end of 2014, at which point we expect more than 50 per cent to be retail assets.
The substantial reduction we have achieved in our non-core portfolio means we have now met our Ec asset reduction commitment of 181 billion and we will now seek formal release from this commitment, substantially ahead of the deadline of 31 december 2014.
The Financial Policy committee FPc published its Financial stability Report on 29 november 2012 recommending that the Financial services Authority FsA takes action to ensure that the capital of uK banks and building societies reflects a proper valuation of their assets, a realistic assessment of future conduct costs and prudent calculation of risk weights.
The Group has made significant progress and continues to deliver on its strategy of strengthening the balance sheet, including its capital position, to improve the resilience of the Group.
The Group has strong governance, processes and controls which, combined with the Groups proactive management of risk, result in an appropriate level of capital.
This includes: Rigorous stress testing exercises where the results are shared with the FsA: and Prudent internal models, based on empirical data, that meet regulatory and stringent internal requirements in the context of on-going macro prudential policy discussions the Board has decided to issue new lloyds Banking Group ordinary shares to fund discretionary payments on tier 1 hybrid capital securities to be made during 2013. such discretionary payments are estimated to amount to approximately 350 million and will be made subject to the terms and conditions of the tier 1 hybrid capital securities.
Further detail is included on page 184.
Overall, given our strongly capital generative core business and the ongoing capital accretive non-core asset reduction, we remain confident in the Groups capital position.

We have also improved the maturity profile of wholesale funding, with less than 30 per cent of wholesale funding having a maturity of less than one year at 31 december 2012, compared to 45 per cent at 31 december 2011.
We have also fully repaid all debt issued under the uK Governments credit Guarantee scheme, achieving a reduction of 23.5 billion in 2012. in the first quarter of 2012, we drew 13.5 billion the sterling equivalent at the date of drawdown was 11.2 billion under the European central Banks long-Term Refinancing Operation for an initial term of three years, to part fund a pool of non-core euro denominated assets.
since the year-end, the Group has repaid over 8 billion of these, a decision which demonstrates the Groups balance sheet strength and strong liquidity position.
We will retain the remaining funds as a currency hedge against our European portfolio.
in August 2012, we announced our support for the uK Governments Funding for lending scheme.
We were the first bank to draw on the scheme in september 2012, drawing down 1 billion, with a further 2 billion during the last quarter of 2012.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position.
Our primary liquid asset portfolio at the year-end reduced to 87.6 billion 2011: 94.8 billion, reflecting a reduction in total assets, wholesale funding and regulatory liquidity requirements.
This represents approximately three times our money market funding and is approximately one and half times our aggregate wholesale funding with a maturity of less than a year, providing a substantial buffer in the event of market dislocation.
in addition to primary liquidity assets, we have significant secondary liquidity holdings of 117.1 billion.
Our total liquid assets represent approximately four times our short-term wholesale funding.
Given the improvements we have made to the strength of our balance sheet, we have significantly greater balance sheet flexibility with a strong liquidity position and reduced funding requirements.
We re-purchased over 15 billion of term wholesale funding in 2012, including 8.5 billion through two public tenders for senior funding.
These tenders were undertaken to more effectively manage our overall wholesale funding profile and optimise our future interest expense, whilst maintaining a prudent approach to liquidity.
in January 2013, to promote short-term resilience of bank liquidity risk profiles, the Basel committee amended the calculation of the liquidity coverage Ratio.
This requirement has been relaxed to allow a wider pool of asset classes to be deemed to be liquid, and to lengthen the implementation timeframe and assumed cash outflows have been reduced.
We await the FsAs interpretation as it applies to uK banks before we can assess the impact to our liquidity position.
Conclusion in 2012 we delivered a significantly improved underlying performance with key metrics in line with or ahead of expectations and guidance.
The core business continues to deliver strong and stable returns, above the cost of equity.
in a challenging economic and regulatory environment we have further derisked the balance sheet, strengthened the capital position and transformed our funding profile, and as a result, we are now increasingly well positioned for growth.
