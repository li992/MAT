Business review Business review Operating review Dukat Our agship operation and Russias largest primary silver mine Russia, Magadan Region Managing Director: Mikhail Egorov Employees: 1,965 Despite being one of our mature assets, Dukat has demonstrated impressive results in 2012.
Gold 3rd equivalent production grew by 12%, Largest silver deposit in the world and total cash cost reduced by 13% year-on-year as a result of superior operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 34%, marking the 13% increased volume and improved cost levels.
The operation has potential Silver production in 2012: 19.2 Moz for further improvement through additional ore sources in the region such as recently acquired Olcha and continuous implementation of 272 best practices and new technologies in underground mining and Silver reserves, Moz processing methods.
34% Adjusted EBITDA growth, 2011 2012 % Priorities for 2013 completion of preparatory works and In 2013, development of our mining a change in mining method.
At Arylakh, operations at Dukat will be increasingly along with the start of underground focused on the efficiency of our mining, exploration of ore zone 9 will be underground operations.
At Lunnoye, mining works Dukat mine we will completely shift will continue at ore zone 7. to underground mining, with an automated ore trucking system In 2013 we plan to construct a winter expected to be commissioned in the road to access the newly acquired second half of 2013.
The system will Olcha deposit, which will start to supply allow fully automated ore underground ore to the Lunnoye plant from 2014 transportation by rail, allowing us to open-pit mining to start in Q1 2014. achieve a total 1500 Ktpa capacity at At the Lunnoye processing plant, the Dukat mine in the medium term.
operations will be focused on the Mining works will also develop at automation of the processing facility the Vostochny part of the deposit.
and debottlenecking with a target to At Goltsovoye, we expect significant increase capacity to 400 Ktpa in 2014. growth in ore mined following the 28 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2012 Annual Report 2012 Polymetal International plc 29 Business review Business review Operating review Processing activity at Dukat Lunnoye 1 2 3 Dukat 4 Omsukchan Dukat 6 5 Mines continued Ar 1 ylakh L 2 unnoye Perevalny 3 4 Nachalny-2 Magadan Duka 5 t 6 Goltsovoye Ore transportation at Lunnoye Underground mining at the Dukat plant Processing plants Town by an impressive 55% to 24.3 thousand metres in 2012. blast-hole stoping method have yielded positive results 2012 highlights Processing plants The amount of ore mined was 1,328 Kt, an 11% growth, with compared to previously used shrinkage stoping method, Omsukchan concentrator Mining almost 90% of ore sourced from underground.

At Arylakh, open-pit mining is approaching completion Commencement of production year 2002 which is expected in Q2 2013, to be followed by underground mines, resulting in an 8% increase in total ore mined Ore sources Dukat, Goltsovoye to 1,782 Kt and stable average silver grade mined At Goltsovoye, underground development was focused development.
