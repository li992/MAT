This is a tremendous turnaround story after the purchase of the underperforming Kubaka plant and satellite deposits back 46% in 2008-2009.
In 2012, Omolon produced 173 Koz of gold equivalent Ore processed in 2012: 840 Kt after successful transportation of high-grade ore from Sopka and the commissioning of the Merrill-Crowe circuit at the refurbished 172% Kubaka plant.

We are planning commissioned in June 2013. to truck more than 280 Kt of high-grade ore from Sopka by winter road, and Preparatory works for the installation mining at Tsokol will grow since the mine of heap leaching pads at Sopka will will be operational for the full calendar take place in 2013, with commissioning year.
