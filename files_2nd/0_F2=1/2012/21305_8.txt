com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 117 Risk review Credit risk continued Balance sheet concentrations of credit risk A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.
The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged.
Further detail on the Groups policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented on page 322.
Geographic concentrations As at 31 December 2012, the geographic concentration of the Groups assets remained broadly consistent with 31 December 2011.
For balance sheet assets, the most significant change in concentrations was for cash held at central banks, with cash held as part of the liquidity pool moving from lower yielding Sterling and US Dollar accounts to higher yielding Euro and Swiss Franc accounts.
There was also a notable increase in the proportion of available for sale debt securities issued by counterparties in Europe, primarily high quality bonds forming part of the Group liquidity pool.
This increase was accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of debt securities issued by Asian predominantly Japanese and UK counterparties.
Within off-balance sheet, there was a significant reduction in the concentration of exposures in the Americas due to the cessation of the securities lending arrangements contracted with BlackRock, Inc. upon the disposal of Barclays Global Investors in 2009.
Further detail on this transaction is included in Note 28.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 121 Risk review Credit risk continued Balance sheet credit quality The following tables present the credit quality of Group assets exposed to credit risk.
Basis of preparation For performing loans that are neither past due nor impaired, which form the majority of loans in the portfolios, the following internal measures of credit quality have been used for the purposes of this analysis: Strong there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full: Satisfactory whilst there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to retail facilities, such as credit card balances and unsecured loans, which have been classified as satisfactory, regardless of the fact that the output of internal grading models may have indicated a higher classification: and Higher risk there is concern over the obligors ability to make payments when due.
These have not yet converted to actual delinquency.
Non-performing loans loans that are impaired or are past due but not impaired have been included in the Higher Risk category for this analysis with prior year comparatives restated to align presentation.
An age analysis of both is presented on pages 127-128.
For assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer.
Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies.
The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.

Traded assets continued to remain almost entirely investment grade, with counterparties to 94% 2011: 95% of total derivative financial instruments, and issuers of 94% 2011: 95% of debt securities held for trading and 94% 2011: 91% of debt securities held available for sale being investment grade.
The credit quality of counterparties to reverse repurchase agreements held at amortised cost remained broadly stable at 73% 2011: 77%.
The credit risk of these assets is much reduced with balances being fully collateralised.
In the loan portfolios, 81% of home loans 2011: 78% to customers are measured as strong.
This increase in the period reflects improvements in the UK portfolio.
The majority of credit card, unsecured and other retail lending remained satisfactory, reflecting the unsecured nature of a significant proportion of the balance, comprising 69% of the total 2011: 70%.
The credit quality profile of the Groups corporate lending improved with counterparties rated strong increasing to 66% 2011: 61%, primarily due to the continued active management of corporate books in the Investment Bank and Corporate Banking.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 123 Risk review Credit risk continued Analysis of loans and advances and impairment Total gross loans and advances to customers and banks decreased 3% to 500.3bn.
Gross loans and advances to customers and banks at amortised cost decreased 3% to 475.9bn with a 7% decrease in the wholesale portfolio offset by a 1% increase in the retail portfolio.
The principal drivers for this decrease were: Investment Bank where loans and advances decreased 9% to 147.4bn driven by a reduction in corporate, interbank and other wholesale lending: and Corporate Banking where loans and advances decreased 6% to 65.8bn due to the disposal of the Iveco Finance business and a reduction in Spanish exposures.
These decreases were offset by an increase in: UKRBB, where a 5% increase to 129.7bn primarily reflected growth in home loans balances: and Barclaycard, where an 8% increase to 34.7bn primarily reflected business growth in the UK and the US and acquisition of portfolios in the US and South Africa.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Retail credit risk Gross loans and advances to customers in the retail portfolios increased 1% to 232.7bn, due to increases in: UKRBB of 5% to 129.7bn driven by growth in home loans balances: Barclaycard of 8% to 34.7bn primarily reflecting business growth in the UK and US and acquisition of portfolios in the US and South Africa: and Wealth and Investment Management of 21% to 2.5bn reflecting growth in the Wealth International home loans portfolio.
These increases were partially offset by decreases of 9% in Africa RBB to 24.0bn primarily due to adverse currency movements and 8% in Europe RBB to 41.0bn due to credit tightening actions, active management to reduce funding mismatches and currency movements.
Retail impairment allowances decreased 14% to 4.6bn principally due to changes in the write-off policy, debt sales, lower severity and improved delinquency.
The total loan impairment charge across the retail portfolios reduced 16% to 2.1bn: The loan impairment charge at Barclaycard decreased 22% to 1.0bn as a result of improved delinquency, lower charge-offs and better recovery rates: The loan impairment charge at UKRBB decreased 50% to 0.3bn mainly reflecting improvements across all portfolios, which also includes higher recoveries principally from refunds of PPI in Consumer Lending and release of provision due to the resolution of backlogs in litigation in home loans: The reduction was partially offset by Africa RBB loan impairment charge, which increased 22% to 0.5bn reflecting higher loss given default rates and higher levels of write-offs in the South African home loans recovery book: and Europe RBB impairment charge increased 36% to 0.3bn due to deterioration in credit performance reflecting current economic conditions across Europe.
Lower impairment charges coupled with higher loan balances led to a fall in the retail loan loss rate to 89bps 2011: 108ps.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 131 Risk review Credit risk continued Arrears rates remained steady in the UK as targeted balance growth and better customer affordability criteria continued to be supported by the low base rate environment.
The recoveries impairment coverage ratio decreased mainly because of a release of provision due to the resolution of backlogs in litigation.
In the UK, owner-occupied interest only balances of 38.1bn 2011: 39.2bn represented 33% of total stock.
Buy-to-let home loans comprised 7% of the total stock 2011: 6%.
For information on interest only lending, refer to page 135.
Arrears rates for South Africa home loans significantly decreased reflecting improvements in portfolio performance.
Increased focus on reducing the recoveries portfolio during 2012 resulted in higher write-offs.
Coverage ratio on recoveries increased due to a higher mix of insolvent accounts in this portfolio.
These accounts result in higher losses due to increased legal costs and longer time to foreclose.
Credit performance of home loans in Europe continued to worsen as economic conditions deteriorated further.
In Spain home loans, the recoveries impairment coverage ratio increased mainly due to incremental impairment taken to reflect potential declines in house prices.
During 2012, using current valuations, the average LTV of principal home loans portfolios remained broadly stable in UK, South Africa and Italy.
However, it increased in Spain and Portugal as a result of continued decline in house prices.
The increase in average LTV for new home loans business to 56.4% 2011: 54.0% in the UK was driven by the launch of a 90% LTV product, on a limited basis.
The volume in this segment is constrained by tight credit criteria and risk limits, as evidenced by the moderate increase of new home loans proportion above 85%.
Notes a Excluded from the above analysis are: Wealth International home loans, which are managed on the basis of individual customer exposures, France home loans and other small home loans portfolios.
b UK, South Africa and Italy marked to market methodology is based on valuation weighted approach.
Valuation weighted LTV is the ratio between total outstanding balance and the value of total collateral held against these balances.
Spain and Portugal marked to market methodology is based on balance weighted approach.
Balance weighted LTV is derived by calculating individual LTVs at account level and weighting it by the individual loan balances to arrive at the average position.
This is in line with local reporting practice.
c Portfolio marked to market based on the most updated valuation and includes recoveries balances.
Updated valuations reflect the application of the latest house price index available in the country as at 31 December 2012 to calculate the average MTM portfolio LTV as at 31 December 2012. d In Portugal, the increase in average MTM LTVs and in the LTV distribution are due to the application of more detailed house price valuations since June 2012.

Retail forbearance programmes Retail forbearance is available to customers experiencing financial difficulties.
Forbearance solutions may take a number of forms depending on the extent of the financial dislocation.
Short term solutions normally focus on temporary reductions to contractual payments and switches from capital and interest payments to interest only.
For customers with longer term financial difficulties, term extensions may be offered, which may also include interest rate concessions and conversion to fully amortising balances for card portfolios.
Forbearance on the Groups principal portfolios in the US, UK and Europe is presented below.
In South Africa, forbearance and rehabilitation balances are not published as local practices are in the process of being aligned to the Barclays Group policy.
In other retail portfolios the level of forbearance extended to customers is not material and typically is not a significant factor in the management of customer relationships.
Loans in forbearance in the principal home loans portfolios increased 3% to 1,987m, mainly due to an increase in Spain and Italy home loans.
Within UK home loans, term extensions account for over 80% of forbearance balances with the majority of the remainder being switches from capital and interest to interest only.
In Spain forbearance accounts are predominantly full account restructures.
In Italy the majority of the balances relate to specific schemes required by the Italian government e. g. debt relief scheme following the earthquake of 2009 and amendments are weighted towards payment holidays and interest suspensions.

Exposures to interest only home loans In the course of its retail lending business, the Group provides interest only mortgages to customers, mainly in the UK.
Under the terms of these loans, the customer makes payments of interest only for the entire term of the mortgage, although customers may make early repayments of the principal provided that these are no more than 5% of the principal balance in any year.
Subject to such overpayments, the entire principal remains outstanding until the end of the loan term and the customer is responsible for repaying this on maturity.
The repayment vehicle may include sale of the mortgaged property.
Interest only lending is subject to underwriting criteria that include: a maximum size of loan, maximum loan to value ratios, affordability and maximum loan term amongst other criteria.
Borrowers on interest only terms must have a repayment strategy in place to repay the loan at maturity and a customer contact strategy has been developed to ensure ongoing communications are in place with interest only customers at various points during the term of the mortgage.
The contact strategy is varied dependent on our view of the risk of the customer.
a b Interest only mortgages comprise 53bn 46% of the total 115bn UK Home Loans portfolio.
Of these, 46bn are owner-occupied with the c remaining 7bn buy-to-let.

The main factors in management adjustments to models include changes to reflect current economic conditions and a decline in recoveries.
Adjustments typically increase the model derived impairment allowance.
Management adjustments to models for retail impairment resulted in a total additional impairment charge of 45.9m in 2012.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 135 Risk review Credit risk continued Wholesale credit risk Gross loans and advances to customers and banks in the wholesale portfolios decreased 7% to 243.2bn principally as a result of a 9% fall in the Investment Bank mainly due to a reduction in corporate, interbank and other wholesale lending.
For more detail, see analysis of Investment Bank wholesale loans and advances on page 138.
Furthermore, there was a 6% decrease in balances in Corporate Banking primarily in Europe due to the disposal of the Iveco Finance business and a reduction in Spanish exposures.
The total loan impairment charge across the wholesale portfolios increased 13% to 1.5bn principally due to higher charges in the Investment Bank, due to charges in ABS CDO Super Senior positions and losses on a small number of single name exposures.
In addition, there was a non-recurring release of 223m in 2011.
Furthermore, the impairment charge in Africa RBB increased 118% to 174m, principally due to the impact of one large name in the commercial property portfolio in South Africa.
This was partially offset by lower loan impairment charges in Corporate Banking, principally in Spain where there are ongoing initiatives to reduce exposure within the property and construction sector.
The higher impairment charge and lower loan balances led to a higher wholesale loan loss rate of 61bps in 2012 2011: 50bps.
CRLs in the wholesale portfolio decreased 11% to 9,744m primarily due to decreases in Investment Banking, where lower balances principally reflected asset sales and paydowns, as well as decreases in Corporate Banking, where the lower balances principally reflected the disposal of the Iveco Finance business in Europe.

Barclays received collateral from clients in support of OTC derivative transactions.
These transactions are generally undertaken under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements governed by either UK or New York law.
Exposure relating to derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, stock borrowing and loan transactions is calculated using internal FSA approved models.
These are used as the basis to assess both regulatory capital and capital appetite and are managed on a daily basis.
The methodology encompasses all relevant factors to enable the current value to be calculated and the future value to be estimated, for example, current market rates, market volatility and legal documentation including collateral rights.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Exposures to Eurozone countries audited Overview The Group recognises the credit and market risk resulting from the ongoing volatility in the Eurozone and continues to monitor events closely while taking coordinated steps to mitigate the risks associated with the challenging economic environment.
Risks associated with a potential partial break-up of the Euro area include: Direct risk arising from sovereign default of an exiting country and the impact on the economy of, and the Groups counterparties in, that country: Indirect risk arising from the subsequent impact on the economy of, and the Groups counterparties in, other Eurozone countries: Indirect risk arising from credit derivatives that reference Eurozone sovereign debt see page 153 : and Direct redenomination risk on the potential mismatch in the currency of the assets and liabilities on balance sheets of the Groups local operations in countries in the Eurozone see page 154.
The Group has performed and continues to perform stress tests to model the event of a break-up of the Eurozone area.
Contingency planning has also been undertaken based on a series of potential scenarios that might arise from an escalation in the crisis.
Multiple tests have been run to establish the impact on customers, systems, processes and staff in the event of the most plausible scenarios.
Where issues have been identified, appropriate remedial actions have either been completed or are underway.
During 2012 the Groups net on-balance sheet exposures to Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus and Greece reduced by 13% to 59.0bn.
Exposure to retail customers and corporate clients reduced 12% to 48.1bn, largely reflecting reduced lending in Spain, Italy and Portugal as part of the active management to reduce redenomination risk.
Sovereign exposure decreased 29% to 5.0bn, principally due to a reduction in government bonds held as available for sale.
Basis of preparation These disclosures are prepared on the same basis as the previous Annual Report and present the direct balance sheet exposure to credit and market risk by country, with the totals reflecting allowance for impairment, netting and cash collateral held where appropriate.
Trading and derivatives balances relate to Investment Bank activities, principally as market-maker for government bond positions.
Positions are held at fair value, with daily movements taken through profit and loss: Trading assets and liabilities are presented by issuer type, whereby positions are netted to the extent allowable under IFRS.
Where liability positions exceed asset positions by counterparty type, exposures are presented as nil: Derivative assets and liabilities are presented by counterparty type, whereby positions are netted to the extent allowable under IFRS.
Cash collateral held is then added to give a net credit exposure.
Where liability positions and collateral held exceed asset positions by counterparty type, exposures are presented as nil: and Assets designated at fair value include debt and equity securities, loans and reverse repurchase agreements that have been designated at fair value.
Available for sale assets are principally investments in government bonds and other debt securities.
Balances are reported on a fair value basis, with movements in fair value going through other comprehensive income OCI.
a Loans and advances held at amortised cost comprise: i retail lending portfolios, predominantly mortgages secured on residential property: and ii corporate lending portfolios.
Settlement balances and cash collateral are excluded from this analysis.
b Sovereign exposures reflect direct exposures to central and local governments, the majority of which are used for hedging interest rate risk and liquidity purposes.
The remaining portion is actively managed reflecting our role as a leading primary dealer, market maker and liquidity provider to our clients.
Financial institution and corporate exposures reflect the country of operations of the counterparty or issuer depending on the asset class analysed including foreign subsidiaries and without reference to cross-border guarantees.
Retail exposures reflect the country of residence for retail customers and country of operations for business banking customers.
Off-balance sheet exposure consists primarily of undrawn commitments and guarantees issued to third parties on behalf of our corporate clients.
Notes a The Group also enters into reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending, which are materially fully collateralised.
b In addition, the Group held cash with the central banks of these countries totalling 0.7bn as at 31 December 2012 2011: 0.8bn.
Other material balances with central banks are classified within loans to financial institutions.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 143 Risk review Credit risk continued Summary of Group exposures The following table shows Barclays exposure to Eurozone countries monitored internally as being higher risk and thus being the subject of particular management focus.
Detailed analysis on these countries is on pages 146-152.
Exposures on loans and advances to geographic regions including Europe as a whole are set out on pages 125-126.
The net exposure provides the most appropriate measure of the credit risk to which the Group is exposed.
The gross exposure is also presented below, alongside off-balance sheet contingent liabilities and commitments.
Gross exposure reflects total exposures before the effects of economic hedging by way of trading portfolio liabilities, derivative liabilities, and cash collateral, but after taking into account impairment allowances and IFRS netting.
Spanish sovereign exposure reduced 33% to 1.7bn due to the disposal of available for sale government bonds, held for the purpose of interest rate hedging and liquidity, which have been replaced by interest rate swaps with alternative counterparties.
Italian sovereign exposure decreased 24% to 2.7bn principally due to a reduction in government bonds held as available for sale.
Residential mortgage exposure reduced by 5% to 32.5bn, reflecting lower new originations across Spain, Italy and Portugal in line with Group strategy to reduce redenomination risk.
Other retail lending reduced by 17% to 6.3bn driven primarily by reduced lending to business banking customers in Spain and Portugal as a result of the challenging economic conditions.
Corporate exposure reduced 27% to 9.3bn, largely reflecting reduced lending in Spain, Italy and Portugal as part of the active management to reduce the aggregate net funding mismatch in local balance sheets.
Exposures to financial institutions fell marginally by 3% to 5.8bn, with reduced exposure in Ireland of 0.5bn and in Italy of 0.1bn offsetting an increase in Spain of 0.5bn.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Barclays has exposures to other Eurozone countries as set out below.
Total net on-balance sheet exposures to individual countries that are less than 1bn are reported in aggregate under Other.
Sovereign exposure increased 17% to 12.4bn principally due to an increase in government bonds held as available for sale in the Netherlands, Austria and Finland of 4.4bn, partially offset by a reduction in traded exposures to Germany of 3.0bn.
Exposures to financial institutions and corporates increased 14% and 17%, to 16.4bn and 12.1bn respectively, reflecting increases in securities issued by German counterparties.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Analysis of indirect exposures Indirect exposure to sovereigns can arise through a number of different sources, including credit derivatives referencing sovereign debt: guarantees to savings and investment funds which hold sovereign risk: lending to financial institutions who themselves hold exposure to sovereigns and guarantees, implicit or explicit, by the sovereign to the Groups counterparties.
A geographic and industrial analysis of the Groups loans and advances, including lending to European counterparties by type, is set out on pages 125-126. Credit derivatives referencing sovereign debt The Group enters into credit mitigation arrangements principally credit default swaps and total return swaps for which the reference asset is government debt.
For Spain, Italy and Portugal these have the net effect of reducing the Groups exposure in the event of sovereign default.
An analysis of the Groups credit derivatives referencing sovereign debt is presented below.

An analysis of the effects of such netting is presented below.

Credit derivatives referencing sovereign assets are bought and sold to support client transactions and for risk management purposes.
The contract notional amount represents the size of the credit derivative contracts that have been bought or sold, while the fair value represents the change in the value of the reference asset.
The net protection or exposure from credit derivatives in the event of sovereign default amount represents a net purchase or sale of insurance by the Group.
This insurance reduces or increases the Groups total exposure and should be considered alongside the direct exposures disclosed in the preceding pages.
In addition, the Group has indirect sovereign exposure through the guarantee of certain savings and investment funds, which hold a proportion of their assets in sovereign debt.
As at 31 December 2012, the net liability in respect of these guarantees was 33m 2011: 41m.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 153 Risk review Credit risk continued Exposure to Eurozone residential property sector Barclays risk exposure and impairment in Spain and Portugal has been and will be affected by the housing sector in those countries as a result of changes to the banks risk appetite in a declining housing sector, where the desired level of new business has been reduced, and with it, the total exposure.
Falls in property prices have led to higher credit risk and higher impairment charges.
The 2012 impairment charge to our residential mortgage book in Spain was 72m 2011: 38m and in Portugal was 24m 2011: 9m.
These increases were principally driven by: i Negative house price movements: this has reduced market demand and also mortgage supply with the result that a customers ability to sell has reduced and the likelihood of repossessions has increased.
Impairment charges have risen, given a loss event as the loss on default has increased due to lower amounts realised from the sale of properties in a distressed market: and ii Customers behaviour and a reduced willingness to pay as a result of their perception of a lower equity stake.
For information on our exposures to home loans in Spain and Portugal see pages 131-132.
Eurozone balance sheet redenomination risk Redenomination risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group should one or more countries exit the Euro, leading to a potentially different valuation of local balance sheet assets and liabilities.
The Group is directly exposed to redenomination risk where there could be a different value for locally denominated assets and liabilities.
Within Barclays, retail banking, corporate banking and wealth management activities in the Eurozone are generally booked locally within each country.
Locally booked customer assets and liabilities, primarily loans and advances to customers and customer deposits, are predominantly denominated in Euros.
The remaining funding need is met through local funding secured against customer loans and advances, with any residual need funded through the Group.
During 2012, a series of mitigating actions was taken to reduce local net funding mismatches primarily by raising local liabilities in Spain, Portugal and Italy.
These actions included the drawdown of 8.2bn in the European Central Banks three year Long Term Refinancing Operation LTRO in Spain and Portugal.
As a result of these mitigating actions the Group reduced the aggregate net funding mismatch in local balance sheets from 12.1bn to a 1.9bn surplus in Spain, from 6.9bn to 3.3bn in Portugal and from 12.0bn to 9.6bn in Italy.
Barclays continues to monitor the potential impact of the Eurozone volatility on local balance sheet funding and will consider actions as appropriate to manage the risk.
Direct exposure to Greece is very small with negligible net funding required from Group.
For Ireland there is no local balance sheet funding requirement by the Group as total liabilities in this country exceed total assets.
