Tom Chambers Chambers Plumbing and Heating Getting what our customers want, when they want it is what sets us apart from our competition.
PlumbCenter in the UK recognises the importance of this and in October2011 introduced a new andimproved trade price guide.
The trade price guide is issued quarterly to all customers sothat they always have up to date information about ourproduct availability and pricing.
Our installers need to plan their working week and the new price guide indicates whether any of the 18,000 product lines are in branch that day, are available within 24 hours, 48 hours or for special orders advises them to check with their local branch.
This is done through a simple colour coding system so that installers can easily nd out the availability of a product.
Thissaves the customer time as they do not need to travel frombranch to branch or make a phone call to nd out.
Plumb Center has improved branch product availability toover 99 per cent through making various supply chain improvements over the last two years.
