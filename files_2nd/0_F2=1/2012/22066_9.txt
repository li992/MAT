by the reduced availability and higher cost of debt.
Quintain Estates has made good progress to improve cash low and has progressed its projects at Wembley and Greenwich.
It has also reduced and lengthened its debt proile to 2016.
It trades at a 67% discount to the September 2011 NAV.
We believe this will reduce as it achieves more of its stated milestones and offers good value.
London & Stamford has had an active year, buying opportunistically and also trading other interests.
It is not yet fully invested, has paid an increasing dividend and remains well placed to take advantage of any market weakness.
We increased marginally our holding in the company and we are now the largest shareholder at 6.2%.
Brookshire Capital is a recent investment to build a largely industrial portfolio run by an experienced team previously at Rugby Estates.
