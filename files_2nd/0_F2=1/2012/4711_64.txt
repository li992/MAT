The North American business has delivered another strong set of results.
2012 We have continued to drive price mix by staying focused on: disciplined North America promotional spend, growth of our strategic brands and the continued growth of our premium and super premium brands, most notably Johnnie Walker and Croc.
Weve achieved this through consistent investment in targeted campaigns that have improved brand equities.
Innovation continues to be a competitive strength and we have both sustained past launches and delivered exciting new products.
Previously identified enhancements to our distribution system were implemented in the year and will benefit our future growth.
Strong pricing and mix shift to premium products, coupled with our continued focus on cost, drove margin improvement, however this was offset by higher marketing.
These measures, taken together, have delivered efficient growth and strengthened our business.
