No longer do I have to dedicate two hours of my life each week to walking the aisles and facing the queues in the supermarket.
I can shop for my daily essentials, and so many more of my requirements, from the comfort of my own home.
The food is very fresh and I have so much choice: they even guarantee my shopping will be cheaper than Tesco !
The service is so easy to use, and so reliable.
