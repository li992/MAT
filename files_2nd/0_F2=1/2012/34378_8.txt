UNDERSTANDING OUR STRATEGY OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY Our vision OUR VISION IS TO BUILD THE BEST REIT IN EUROPE.
Our ability to be the best REIT depends on: the strength of our leadership skills: the quality of our property and financing expertise: the quality and sustainability of the environments we create for our occupiers: our ability to attract high-quality partners and the returns we generate for our shareholders.
The way we do business is embodied in our values.
We have a clear set of strategic goals which help focus our activities and resources on those initiatives which will drive value.
Together with our values, our strategy is aimed at delivering our vision of building the best REIT in Europe.
Our objective BEING THE BEST REIT FOR US MEANS PRODUCING CONSISTENT OUTPERFORMANCE OVER TIME.
We measure our progress against this objective in two key ways.
First, relative to total property returns as measured by IPD, the most commonly used property benchmarking service in the UK.
