We currently have twoaerobic tunnel composting sites in Ontario a 150,000 tonne per annum facility in London and a 100,000 tonne per annum facility in Ottawa.
Both sites are backed by long-term municipal contracts.
0DUNHW RYHUYLHZ In recent years there has been strong public opinion against landll, which in some areas hasled to a shortage of consented capacity.
Consequently the Canadian provinces have targeted the diversion of waste from landll.
Theintroduction of feed in tariffs and green aspirations has led to stimulation of interest inanaerobic digestion.
Circa 6m tonnes oforganic waste is produced annually in Ontarioand currently less than 20% of sourcesegregated organics is composted.
The waste management industry is fragmented with competitors being principally local with a few European suppliers.
Our main competitors are currently unable to meet the stringent regulations and technical requirements oftheMinistry of Environment in Canada.
Orgaworld is the market-leader in its region andcan offer a wide range of processing techniques for the total range of organic waste.
6WUDWHJLF GULYHUV The strategy in Canada is to become market leader in the treatment of organic waste streamsfrom municipalities through the development of further production plants togrow across the country.
The key strategic drivers are regulatory developments and the security of input volumes.
Investment will focus on regions where input volumes are secured through long-term municipal contracts.
