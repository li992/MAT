To optimise the efficiency of the solar heating systems, they were equipped with energy meters and data-log monitoring which register the energy production.
The outcomes achieved were: optimal efficiency and a resulting saving on fossil fuels, reduced CO 2 emissions and a reliable benchmarking tool for other Blue Village Hotels.
