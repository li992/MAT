KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS KPIs In order to realise its strategic aims, PayPoint has identied areas of strategic focus and records a number of KPIs to measure progress against them.
Whilst these KPIs are helpful in measuring the groups performance, they are not exhaustive and the group uses many other measures to monitor progress.
