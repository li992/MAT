For the Solid Waste business this will be achieved by diversication into municipal markets and broadening the product portfolio to offset falling volumes and lower prices in the traditional solid waste markets.
Also, there will be more focus onthe production of high quality fuel substitutes and recyclates.
The key strategic drivers remainthe availability of waste and the highly competitive pricing in the incineration market.
For Hazardous Waste, the availability of soil volumes is key and with less Netherlands basedactivities it is important to win overseas contracts.
The lower activity in the industrial market for paint waste will be replaced with further waterside activities given our recent expansion of capacity in this area.
For Organics the increased focus on processing organic waste will lead to opportunities in this market.
We are also focused on using the attributes of all three businesses to provide combined solutions involving Solid Waste, Hazardous Waste and Organics to our customers.
Webelieve that increasingly customers will require a single supplier to deal with all of their waste requirements.
