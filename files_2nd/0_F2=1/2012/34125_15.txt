Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 5.
STORE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION continued 5.1 Energy Performance Certificates EPCs continued In the case of our Twickenham store it achieved a net zero carbon emission rating.
This means that the predicted electricity use, carbon emissions, bills and carbon tax would be low due to the energy saved by increased building energy efficiency in design and the supply of on-site solar energy in the building specification.
5.2 The Considerate Constructors Scheme CCS Our CCS performance continued to improve in the areas of construction site environmental protection, workforce safety and our responsibility to local communities, beyond regulatory requirements.
We improved in areas such as: being considerate: site appearance: and accountability.
CCS auditors visited our construction sites and assessed performances out of a maximum score of 40 points.
Site reports were sent to the Construction Director and CSR Manager for review and actions, if required.
Considerate Constructors Scheme performance Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 target Number of construction projects on site 76 3 Percentage of registered sites UK average 81.8% 88.8 % 100% 100% Average points score for all sites phases 32.1 31.3 33.9 32.0 All of our sites under construction Stockport, New Cross and Chiswick exceeded compliance with the schemes code by achieving over 24 points on each monitoring visit.
Our average score of 33.9 exceeded the CCS UK average score of 31 and so all sites were awarded at least one Certificates of Performance Beyond Compliance and ranked within the top 10% of the schemes sites to be reviewed for CCS National Awards.
Our target set for 2011 31.5 points was exceeded by 7.6%.
