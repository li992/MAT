what drIvEs growth The global specialist recruitment market is driven primarily by confidence amongst both businesses, to replace people who leave, and candidates to move jobs.
In addition, we identify four further factors currently driving fee growth: the emergence of structural growth markets: the macroeconomic cycle: skills shortages: and the globalisation oftheflow of labour.

thE contExt The forecast demand for Australian resources will mean that up to half of all new jobs created in the next few years will be 2 in the mining sector and related industries.
Whilst in the long term this is good news for job creation in Australia, the immediate issue is one of skills shortages in the mining regions.
Many of the roles that are vital to the sector require experts with niche skills and experience and sourcing this talent is proving to be a challenge for many of our clients.
thE clIEnts challEngE Newmont is one of the worlds top five global gold producers, with multiple underground and open pit mining operations in Western Australia.
The mining talent they need to source is highly skilled and in short supply, as the level of knowledge and qualifications needed for roles is exceptionally high.
As part of the ongoing relationship we have with them, they came to Hays for help in finding a drill & blast engineer, a position that they have struggled to fill in the past due to the technical nature of the role and the lack of available candidates.
hays ExpErtIsE In actIon Due to our in-depth knowledge of Newmonts requirements and our extensive global database of candidates we were quickly able to present a qualified experienced mining engineer.
Newmont was so impressed with the candidate, Fredrik Gransell, that within an hour of receiving his CV they arranged an interview on-site.
They flew Fredrik from his native Stockholm to Perth and then to their Jundee site for an interview and induction.
Hays was able to work with both Fredrik and Newmont throughout the process to ensure that the fit was right, and two months after the visit, Fredrik relocated to Perth to start his new life and career.
