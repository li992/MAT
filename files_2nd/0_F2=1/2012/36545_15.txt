Strategic review Business and financial review Property portfolio information Governance Financial statements Other information Property portfolio information The weighted average unexpired lease term is eight years Security and quality of income With a weighted average unexpired lease term of more than eight years, our retail portfolio provides a secure income stream with the potential for growth.
The continuing portfolio was 2.0% reversionary at 31 December 2012, compared with 3.5% at the end of the prior year.
The UK portfolio was 1.5% reversionary whilst in France the figure was 3.7%.
Additional income of 16.4 million per annum could be secured from our portfolio by 2015, assuming leases are renewed or pre-let and rent reviews are agreed at current ERVs.
For the UK, it includes tenants break options.
For France, it is based on the date of lease expiry.
2 The ERV at 31 December 2012 for leases that expire or break in each year and ignoring the impact of rental growth and any rent-free periods.
The table above shows that, during the period from 2013 to 2015, leases with current rents passing of 78.5 million will expire or are subject to tenants break clauses.
We estimate that additional rental income of 7.9 million per annum could be secured in respect of expiries.
We have assumed renewals take place at current rental levels and have excluded tenant break options from this calculation, as we consider the probability that they will be exercised to be low.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of void periods, lease incentives or potential changes to rental values.
