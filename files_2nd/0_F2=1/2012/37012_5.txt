What drives our CR activities?
G Securing our licence to operate: Our centres cannot be developed or marketed without engagement with local stakeholders.
Local authorities, town centre management bodies and business partnerships help our centres to become key economic players for their local community and, more widely, for regions of the UK.
Our CR initiatives work to bring partnerships together, including our employees, and foster relationships which help drive efficiency in our daily business operations and contribute to achievement of our longer-term business objectives.
G Supporting risk management: Intus CR actions are ultimately tied to issues highlighted in the risk register of our business.
Equally, forward-looking CR engagement can safeguard and enhance the reputation of Intu in the eyes of others including investors, regulatory bodies and retailers.
G Contributing to cost management: Our approach to environmental and facilities management underpins our broader desire to operate in an environmentally responsible manner.
It also contributes substantial cost savings.
