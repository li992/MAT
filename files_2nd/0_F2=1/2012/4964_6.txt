Drax Group plc Annual report and 16 accounts 2012 Marketplace Where we sell our power From a nationalised, centrally planned system, the UK electricity sector has been transformed since the beginning of its privatisation in 1990.
Privatisation, liberalisation and energy policy have shaped the market and driven increasing consolidation and market reform.

The construction and demolition sectors are very large producers of recoverable wood.
Availability of biomass Biomass is a diverse, readily available and plentiful fuel source.
According to the International Energy Agency, biomass is the fourth largest energy resource in the world after oil, coal and gas.
It estimates that by 2050, sustainable sources of biomass could be enough to supply the world with 10%20% of its primary energy requirements.
