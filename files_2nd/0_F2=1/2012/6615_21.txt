Since 2010, the UK Government has announced a series of changes to the taxation of pensions which continue to impact the pensions of employees within GSK.
The taxation changes will have significant negative consequences and the effectiveness of pensions will be much reduced.
Pensions have been, and continue to be, an important tool for creating a long-term culture and promoting employee retention.
Therefore, the Committee decided that existing pension promises would be honoured and employees with pensions impacted by the changes would have the opportunity for their pension above the new limit to be delivered via GSKs existing unfunded scheme at that time.
The legacy final salary plans provide for up to two-thirds of final salary at normal retirement age.
Under these plans, actuarial reduction factors apply where a participant leaves employment of his or her own accord before the age of 60.
With effect from April 2013, a cap on pensionable earnings will be introduced, which limits pensionable earnings increases to 2% per annum.
This cap applies to all employees, including Executive Directors, in legacy dened benefit schemes in the UK.
