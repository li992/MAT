2012 Thermal coal demand STRATEGY Global 910 Mt The business is focused on being a high margin producer of thermal coal, with a growth strategy based on participating in and expanding into the most attractive export markets, while maintaining its domestic market commitments.
It aims to deliver on this ambition, in the near term, by developing its current portfolio of expansion projects.
In the longer term, if appropriate, the business will consider asset purchases to supplement growth.
