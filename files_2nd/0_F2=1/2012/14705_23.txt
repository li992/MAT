Importantly, with all of our new and existing stores in Europe, local management are working hard to ensure that all stores are working towards the operational efficiencies and standards that exist across the UK sports stores.
We continue with our strategy to identify partners in new territories while continuing to expand our operations in the countries where we currently trade.
For FY13, we are targeting 10 to 15 new stores and three to five new territories.
In the first quarter, we have already opened six new stores in Hungary, Belgium, Slovenia and France.
We have closed a store in both Belgium and Cyprus.
