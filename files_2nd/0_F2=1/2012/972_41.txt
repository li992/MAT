reconciliation categories Tonnage and content change categories fide nition and explanation Opening Balance as at 31 December previous reporting year Production The amount of material expressed in terms of tonnage or content as applicable removed by planned mining from the scheduled Ore Reserves from Reserve Model i. e. the areas actually mined during the reporting period which are removed from the reserve model s. Depletion The amount of material expressed in terms of tonnage or content as applicable removed by mining from the Mineral Resources i. e. the areas actually from Resource Model mined during the reporting period which are removed from the resource model s. Material removed from the Inferred in Mine Plan category should be reported as Depletion.
Conversion The effect of applying updated Modifying Factors to Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources which include geo-technical, mining, metallurgical, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental considerations including infrastructure.
Includes changes to the mining method, mine plan and or layout changes e. g. changes in pit slope angles or mineable cut due to geo-technical reasons.
The change can be positive or negative year-on-year.
Sub-Categories: Conversion is the process of up-grading Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves based on a change in con dence levels and or modifying factors.
Re-allocation is the process of down-grading of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources or Mineral Resources to Mineralised Inventory based on a change in con dence levels and or modifying factors.
Sterilisation is the process of removing material from Ore Reserves and or Mineral Resources that no longer has reasonable and realistic prospects for eventual economic extraction.
Economic Assumptions The effect of assumptions based on the current or future price of a commodity and exchange rate estimates as determined by the corporate centre Global Assumptions which has a direct impact on the Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves particularly the cut-off grade which can be affected by changes in costs.
New Information The effect of additional resource fide nition information with QA QC information which initiates an update to the geological models facies, structural, grade, geo-technical and results in an updated re-classi ed resource model and subsequent determination of new Ore Reserve estimates.
Includes ore bodies or portions of current orebodies within the same project operation not previously reported.
Other Model Re nement No additional resource fide nition drilling has been undertaken but the interpretation geometry of the orebody has been re ned or internal mine lease boundaries changed e. g. based on mapping information obtained during mining or a different structural model being applied.
Changes to in-situ tonnages as a result of new geological losses being applied or a change to the fide nition of the boundary of the Mineral Resources due to an updated economically mineable cut being applied.
Methodology Only valid for changes in the estimation or classi cation methodologies applied to the resource model evaluation i. e. no new information available or model re nement taken place.
Transfer Movement of Mineral Resources and or Ore Reserves from one type of product ore type to another or from one mining project area to another.
New Technology Changes to Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in response to the application of new or improved mining and or processing methods.
Reconciliation Adjustment Changes which cannot be allocated to a fide ned category or an adjustment necessary to mitigate inaccurate production depletion estimates of the previous year.
Acquisitions Additional Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves due to acquisitions of assets or increased attributable interests in JV agreements associate companies.
Disposals Reduction in Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves due to disposals of assets or reduced attributable interests in JV agreements associate companies, refusal withdrawal of Mining Prospecting Rights or related permits e. g. due to environmental issues, changes in policy.
Closing Balance as at 31 December current reporting year The Production Depletion gures may be estimated for these last three months of the reporting period based on the monthly average of the previous nine months.
2 Ore Reserves: Includes Proved and Probable Mineral Resources: Includes Measured, Indicated and Inferred [for Coal only Inferred in LOM Plan is considered] Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.
