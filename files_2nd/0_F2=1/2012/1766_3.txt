6 Prior to 2012, a schedule adherence metric, which measured the timing of achievement of key contract milestones, was a Customer Focus KPI.
From 2012, this metric is no longer reviewed by the Executive Committee.
7 Prior to 2012, the safety KPI was the Lost Work Day Case Rate, calculated as the number of injuries resulting in days lost per 100,000 employees.
From 2012, the KPI used to monitor safety performance is the Recordable Accident Rate, which focuses on the number of accidents rather than days lost, enabling inclusion of a wider scope of accidents within the Groups reviews, which is expected to lead to improvements in accident prevention.
