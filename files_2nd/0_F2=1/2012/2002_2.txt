The objective to make returns to shareholders in cash, by agreed milestone dates, is aligned to ensuring that Berkeley operates at an optimal size in which returns must be matched with a disciplined approach to risk management over the long-term.
To deliver consistent earnings from an efficient balance sheet, whilst continuing to build the value of the business in the land bank, Berkeleys core performance targets of Return on Equity and Land Bank Growth will remain a focus over the next twelve months.
Berkeley has maintained its balance sheet strength throughout the challenging markets of recent years, and is committed to keeping exibility at the heart of its business plan.
This approach is intended to ensure that Berkeley can remain agile when faced with what it knows to be an inherently cyclical property market.
