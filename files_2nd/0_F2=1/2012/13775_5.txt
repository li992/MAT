Our financial management We maintain a disciplined approach to how we allocate capital KPI Financial strength Our business model continues to be strongly cash generative and we are rigorous in allocating capital to business investment and targeted acquisitions.
We also look to return surplus capital to shareholders and are doing so with our share buyback programme and progressive dividend policy.
Despite an uncertain economic environment, we remain confident about our business and our intention is therefore to reach a net debt level of a minimum of 1x EBITDA by a combination of further capital returns to shareholders and targeted acquisitions.
