More broadly, the Q1 11 Q2 11 Q3 11 Q4 11 Q1 12 Q2 12 Q3 12 Q4 12 market developments in numerous segments of Crude Steel Production Finished Steel Consumption the global steel industry were uneven and varied greatly between different geographical markets.

Steel products price developments US$ t According to Metall Expert consumption of long 800 products in Russia increased in 2012 by 8.8%, including increases in rebar and beam 720 consumption by 19%.
The main drivers of the 640 growth in consumption were construction 13% 560 y-o-y, fabrication of metal structures 13% and seamless pipes 8%.
The Russian construction 480 sector is expected to grow by 4% in 2013, which 400 will continue supporting Russian steel demand, Q1 11 Q2 11 Q3 11 Q4 11 Q1 12 Q2 12 Q3 12 Q4 12 with overall apparent consumption of steel Slab FOB Black Sea Billet FOB Black Sea Rebar FOB Turkey HRC FOB Black Sea anticipated to exceed 22 million tonnes based on estimates from CRU 5%.

Restocking efforts throughout the supply chain and heightened end-user demand contributed to a sharp increase in US long product consumption during the first part of 2012.
However these gains were partially offset by intensified US market uncertainty, towards the middle and end of the year, due to ongoing concerns surrounding the Eurozone debt crisis and economic deceleration in China.
In 2013, US steel consumption growth is expected to exceed the rest of developed world, including the EU and Japan.
Growth in the large diameter gas pipeline market in North America remained constrained as low natural gas prices have led to a reduction in natural gas drilling activity, with a 44% decrease in active gas rigs compared to 2011, according to data from Baker Hughes.
Should the US Government approve legislation to allow liquefied natural gas LNG exports, demand for natural gas pipelines over the next 3-5 years should be spurred.
Imports of oil country tubular goods OCTG to the US were up 25% in 2012 from 2,608 thousand tonnes to 3,258 thousand tonnes, and accounted for approximately 55% of the US OCTG consumption according to Pipelogix.
The reliance by the USA on OCTG imports provides the potential 1.5bt for substitution with locally made products, as produced by EVRAZ in North America.
