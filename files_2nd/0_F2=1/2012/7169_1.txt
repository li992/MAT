Every day we help clients simultaneously dealing with talent shortages in certain markets, while having to reshape workforces in others.
The nature of employment is also changing fast, with technological advances driving evolutions in the way people work.
We understand these complexities and are uniquely positioned across our markets to solve them.
Last year our experts placed around 55,000 people into permanent jobs and around 182,000 people into temporary assignments.
We opened new Hays businesses in Chile, Colombia and most recently Malaysia, our 33rd country of operation.
hays In 2012 Welcome to our 2012 Annual Report & Financial Statements.
2012 was fast-changing and increasingly complex both in terms of the macroeconomic backdrop in which we operated and also the challenges faced by our clients and candidates around the world.
Over the last 10 years, Hays has strategically built a business that is unmatched in terms of its sectoral diversification and geographic footprint, meaning we are able to understand and solve these challenges wherever they occur.
This year we have delivered a good set of results in this context, whilst continuing to develop the Group to ensure we are well placed to meet the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities of the future.
I am proud to be Chairman of a Group with 7,800 experts in 33 countries across 20 specialisms around the world.
It is this diversity that means Hays really are the experts in todays complex world.
