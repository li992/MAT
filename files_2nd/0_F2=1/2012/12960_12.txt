Annual Report 2012 Randgold Resources 31 | Morilas LOM is now expected to extend to 2021.
TSF mineral resources are reported at a US$1 500 oz gold price and reported at a 0.34g t cut-off.
Mineral resources were generated by Miss Paula Oligive, an independent consultant, and Mr Adama Kone, an officer of the company, under the supervision of Jonathan Kleynhans, an officer of the company and competent person.
Open pit mineral reserves are those located within US$1 300 oz pit shell at cut-off equivalent to US$1 300 oz, which is 0.60g t. Stockpile mineral reserves are reported at a US$1 300 oz gold price and reported at a 0.68g t cut-off.
Open pit mineral reserves were calculated by Mr Shaun Gillespie, an independent consultant and competent person.

32 Annual Report 2012 Randgold Resources | The Morila mine was discovered, developed and nanced Processing, plant and engineering by Randgold.
It was commissioned in October 2000 and Processing to December 2012 had produced more than 6.2Moz of gold In 2012, the throughput rate increased to 590tph from 576tph in at a total cash cost of US$263 oz.
During the year, the SAG mill gearbox was changed out successfully converted from an open pit mine to a stockpile several times which led the mine to change the conguration treatment operation.
Closure of the operation was originally to only operate with the ball mill from mid-2013.
The crushing scheduled for 2013 but, together with the Pit 4S pushback and plant will be upgraded to a three-stage crushing operation.
As part of the oxygen system upgrade, a new oxygen unit is due the tailings treatment projects, processing of the marginal ore to be installed in mid-2013 which is expected to continuously and mineralised waste should extend its life to 2021. improve the recovery rate and provide a saving in cyanide consumption.
Mineral resources and reserves Mineral resources currently consist of the remaining stockpile Engineering and power generation material, open pittable material made available through a Engineering availability of 93.1% was 1% lower than 2011, pushback in the south of the pit planned for 2013 and a portion primarily due to the downtime associated with the SAG mill of the Tailngs Storage Facility TSF.
