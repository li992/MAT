Q: What has been your career path at Randgold?
A: I was born in Bamako and on leaving school was fortunate to be selected for a four-year undergraduate degree in mining studies at the University of Pretoria.
The course cost around US$12 000 per year and was part-funded by Randgold.
So on qualication I was happy to return to Mali and work with the company.
Since then Ive had many roles with Randgold, including work at Morila and helping develop the Yalea and Gara underground sites at Loulo.
Im now senior project mining engineer for Kibali and responsible for ensuring all the operational services at the mine are feasible.
For a mine that will produce around 6.6 million tonnes a year, with three million tonnes from underground, theres a lot to be done.
In 2011, I was made mine planning engineer for Q: How important has your training been?

The Randgold approach is very there to help you swim, and thats how I got where I am today.
holistic, so I am exposed to many parts of the business from cost analysis to safety to ventilation.
That gives me a sense that Q: How does the mentoring work?
I can really get to know the company as a whole, stay a long A: For me it has always been a senior manager who sets me goals and standards to achieve, watches my work and who time and continue to rise as the company grows.
