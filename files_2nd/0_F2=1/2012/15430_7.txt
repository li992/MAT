Private average selling Selecting land price in the order book stands at 203k 31 December 2011: 189k, again primarily the result of better quality locations.
We entered 2013 with 327 active outlets 31 December 2011: 312.
Selecting land With land, location is of course critical.
We are first and foremost a local business.
We have a network of 24 businesses, which are located across the country in most key markets.
Our completions and land buying are approximately weighted 60% to the South and 40% to the North.
We have a strong presence in the South East and in London, with 19 active sites and 31 landbank sites in the capital.
Each land purchase we make, regardless of geography, is tested against our strict evaluation criteria, which includes margin, return on capital, market demand and site specic risk assessment.
During 2012, we approved the purchase of 14,172 new plots on 112 new sites at an average contribution margin of c. 23% 2011: 11,756 plots on 106 sites.
Total land spend including land creditors was 427 million 2011: 398 million.
As we have set out, our strategy is to manage the business in line with the cycle, to maximise returns.
We continue to see a number of attractive opportunities in the land market and we have been able to capitalise on the current reduced level of competition to invest in land that will deliver strong financial returns.
At this point in the cycle, this offers the best return proposition for our shareholders.
We continue to monitor the land market and other macro factors carefully and we are committed to the principle of returning cash to our shareholders when the number of attractive land opportunities decreases as competition in the land market heats up and we reach what we believe is optimal scale.
A key focus in 2012 was to maintain and develop our land partnerships and relationships across the business with the aim to become the land buyer that vendors and local communities want to deal with.
We were delighted to be selected with London & Quadrant to build the first residential phase of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Chobham Manor.
As at 31 December 2012, our short term owned and controlled landbank stood at 65,409 plots, representing 6.1 years of supply 31 December 2011: 65,264, 6.4 years.

The Managing the planning and ongoing quality of the short term landbank is protected by the community engagement process strength of our strategic landbank that stood at 100,340 plots as at 31 December 2012 including pipeline plots, an increase of 16% 31 December 2011: 86,236.
Throughout 2012, we have continued to add to our strategic land portfolio, both by the promotion of existing sites through the planning process and by the targeted addition of new potential plots.
Our short term landbank comprises 43% of strategically sourced land 2011: 41% and 24% of our 2012 completions 2011: 17% were on strategically sourced land.
We aim to increase this percentage to 30% of completions from strategically sourced land over the next three years, which underpins our confidence in future margin progression.
Managing the planning and community engagement process A year on from the release of the National Planning Policy Framework and the enactment of the Localism Act, we have changed our business signicantly to embrace the principle of community engagement.
A key element of our strategy is to become the industry leader in managing the planning process across our business, recognising the value this adds both to our local communities and Taylor Wimpey.
We aim to engage with communities and all interested stakeholders before we submit a planning application and during the life cycle of the site.
In this way we can listen to their concerns and incorporate these within our plans where possible.
We have made significant strides during 2012 and are further encouraged by the success that we have achieved to date, which Barnard Castle, County Durham we believe has resulted from being very early to adapt our approach.
Our site at Barnard Castle demonstrates how effective We were also pleased to receive external recognition of our progress consultation and engagement can ensure our planning by being ranked in joint first place in the Impact on Society and applications have the support and buy-in of the local Economy section of the 2012 NextGeneration benchmark.

During 2012 we had one case of enforcement action 2011: nil, where we received one Abatement Notice in respect of dust nuisance, which was quickly rectied.
The health and safety of our customers is of paramount importance to us and we were made aware of an incident of suspected exposure to carbon monoxide at our Grand Union Village GUV development in Northwest London which occurred in January 2012.
The apartment had a type of boiler system which uses what is known as an extended gas ue EGF, where the pipes transporting exhaust gases from the boiler pass through and are concealed within a void in order to reach the outside wall.
Such systems have been widely used by the gas industry since around 2000 and are installed and certied by independent Gas Safe registered engineers.
We responded with a prioritised programme of ue inspections of properties with EGFs at the development and extended our existing nationwide programme of EGF inspections, which we had instigated in line with revised gas industry safety guidance issued in June 2007.
We also took the decision to write to around 150,000 homes built since 2000 in order to highlight the risks of carbon monoxide, the importance of regular boiler servicing and to offer to supply audible carbon monoxide alarms free of charge.
Audible carbon monoxide alarms are now tted as standard in all new Taylor Wimpey properties with a gas appliance.

This will provide a more user friendly experience for our customers, investors and other stakeholders.
Optimising value We have the expertise to buy a good piece of land and make it great.
Our ability to constantly increase efficiency and tightly control costs is part of the Taylor Wimpey culture and remains central to delivering enhanced returns.
We actively review every site, both new and old, through our value improvement meetings, which are held quarterly and are tracked centrally.
This allows us to benchmark our success and identify opportunities for further improvement, ranging from replanning of sites to redesign and selective enhancements to our specication.

This has been highly successful and, as such, we will look to introduce similar programmes for other disciplines in the future, prioritising the skills that are important for our future business.
Throughout the downturn, we maintained our graduate programme, believing rmly in the importance of investing for the future.
During 2012, we recruited seven individuals for our graduate programme, 13 management trainees and 34 apprentices.
From 2013, each of our regional business units will be required to take on at least three apprentices per year.
These groups are monitored throughout their career progression.
