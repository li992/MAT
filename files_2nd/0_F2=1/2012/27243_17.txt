In general, the Company agrees with its suppliers the terms on which business will take place and it is the Companys policy to abide by such terms.
The Bribery Act 2010 The Board of the Company has adopted a zero tolerance approach to instances of bribery and corruption.
Accordingly, it expressly prohibits any Director or associated persons when acting on behalf of the Company, from accepting, soliciting, paying, offering or promising to pay or authorise any payment, public or private, in the United Kingdom or abroad to secure any improper benefit for themselves or for the Company.
The Board insists on the same standards from its service providers in their activities for the Company.
A copy of the Companys Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy can be found on its website at www.
com Future Developments While the future performance of the Company is dependent, to a large degree, on the performance of international financial markets, which, in turn, are subject to many external factors, the Boards intention is that the Company will continue to pursue its stated investment objective in accordance with the strategy outlined above.
Further comments on the outlook for the Company for the next twelve months are set out in both the Chairmans Statement and the Investment Managers Report.
