Remuneration Committee and governance Shareholders rely on the Remuneration Committee providing effective governance over remuneration policy and decision-making reporting into the Board.
Below summarises the Committees work during 2012 on remuneration governance and policy.
3.1 How has the Remuneration Committee continued its focus on remuneration governance?
In 2012 the Remuneration Committee reviewed and followed its already well-established governance policies and processes to meet the requirements of the FSA Remuneration Code and developing best practice requirements.
The key activities and achievements include: Continued working closely with the Audit and Risk Committee in reviewing current and future risks around setting remuneration.
In reviewing risks within the business the Committees attributed responsibility for these risks to individuals to identify the FSA Code staff employees responsible for risk management.
The Remuneration Committee reviews and approves pay for these staff.
Reviewed the Remuneration Committee terms of reference in light of the evolving FSA Remuneration Code.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found on the Companys website http: www.
jsf Regular meetings were held with a structured agenda and follow up process.
The Remuneration Committee held seven meetings.
In these meetings the Remuneration Committee monitored and implemented regulatory and best practice updates.
Rigorous review and approval of the terms for the appointment and termination of the Executive Directors and other key staff.
Reviewed compensation packages proposed for senior hires to ensure there is a sound business case to justify these hires, and guaranteed remuneration was only used in exceptional circumstances.
Compensation was structured such that an appropriate proportion of employees compensation is deferred into shares or funds to create a direct alignment between the rewards and risk exposure of employees with shareholders and investors.
For 2012, deferral is at 100% of variable compensation for the Executive Committee, and up to 60% for other senior employees.
Reviewed performance evaluations for executive directors and recommended Board approval for 2012 remuneration for executive directors.
The Board approves executive directors objectives and compensation given the importance of using compensation to motivate executive directors to deliver the Companys strategic plan.
Reviewed future remuneration policy and, following shareholder consultation, put in place a new Executive Director Incentive Plan for 2013 performance onwards with performance measured against a balanced scorecard of the new Company KPIs and non-financial measures pivotal to the business.

The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Company Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and three further independent non-executive directors.
The Senior Independent Director is also a member of the Audit and Risk Committee thereby facilitating the flow of information between the Committees.
All five members attended all seven meetings held during 2012.
At the invitation of the Committee, the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Head of Human Resources and Head of Compensation, who is also Secretary to the Remuneration Committee, attended selected agenda items requiring their contribution.
No individual participated in the discussion or approval of his or her own compensation.
The Remuneration Committee follows relevant legal and regulatory requirements including the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UKLA listing rules and the FSA Remuneration Code of practice on remuneration policies the FSA Code, and leading investor representative body guidelines including the ABI and NAPF.
The Committee invites independent consultants to provide advice on specific remuneration issues.
This financial period the Remuneration Committee has received advice on remuneration for executive directors from Deloitte on the design of the Executive Incentive Plan.
Management appointments include PwC who are Man's auditors and provide advice on regulatory and other remuneration developments.
43 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 The Committee was found to be operating effectively and had fulfilled its obligations in an independent evaluation of the Committee undertaken by Edis-Bates Associates, as engaged by Man for further information please see page 32.
The evaluation offered recommendations to the committee during 2013 including: The skills and experience of the Committee to be complemented by an appointed external remuneration adviser who attends meetings frequently.
With the pace of current developments in remuneration governance and practice, current briefings to be supplemented by additional training andupdates.
Executive Directors remuneration 4.1 Future remuneration policy for executive directors As set out in the Remuneration highlights a new Executive Incentive Plan is being introduced for executive directors.
The Board consulted with a number of shareholders on this new Executive Incentive Plan proposal to replace the current executive incentives.
In keeping with continuing dialogue with shareholders the Board responded to feedback about the plan, which has now been adopted for the 2013 financial year.
A final grant of DBSOP shares under the current plans will be made in Q1 2013 in relation to 2012 performance: current executive director plans will then be discontinued.
First grants under the new plan will be made in early 2014 in relation to 2013 performance.
Executive Committee members are eligible to participate in the plan alongside executive directors to align the remuneration of the most senior management.
In response to the changes in the financial environment since 2008, Man's business profile and strategy has changed materially.
In essence, the business is being reshaped to align it more closely with fund flows rather than funds under management inventory and investment performance is the key focus.
The Board and management has thus considered the KPIs on which the Company should focus for future success and set out revised KPIs as described more fully on pages 10 and 11.
The revised KPIs are at the centre of the new plan.
The Board has also recognised that the current remuneration structure had become overly complex with a resulting lack of transparency to shareholders and reduced clarity to executives on key goals and what they receive.
Consistent with best practice on simplifying compensation structures for executives the new plan consists of a short-term annual bonus and a long-term deferred bonus.
The short-term annual cash bonus will be assessed against executive director objectives with the objectives and the outcome of performance against these objectives included in the Annual Report at the financial year end.
In line with emerging governance and best practice the new plan introduces a cap on short-term annual cash bonuses of 250% of salary for executive directors where previously this was uncapped.
The long-term deferred bonus plan awards are made subject to assessment based on the three prior years performance against a balanced scorecard of financial and non-financial measures, with 80% determined by financial metrics.
Importantly, and in line with emerging best practice, malus provisions will be introduced with awards forfeited for misstatement and misconduct under the new plan.
Below sets out how executive director remuneration will be directly linked to performance.
A summary review of the proposals is set out below.
There will be a decrease in the face value quantum of awards compared to the previous arrangements to reflect the increased certainty of vesting once the award has been made.

The Remuneration Committee will review the balanced scorecard of metrics prior to the start of each financial year and may amend them so that they remain appropriately challenging.
For the long-term deferred bonus there is a three year assessment period.
The vesting period is set at a further three to five years after each performance period, the resulting combined performance and vesting periods will then be six to eight years from the start of each performance period.
As part of transitional arrangements for the new plan, the performance period will progressively increase to a three year performance period.
Initially, performance will be assessed over a one year period 2013 only with performance being assessed at the 2013 financial year end and with anticipated deferred bonus awards granted in Q1 2014.
Vesting will take place over a further three to five years resulting in a total performance and vesting period of four to six years.
The new plan will be part of the future remuneration policy in accordance with the anticipated Department for Business Innovation and Skills BIS legislation and it will be subject to shareholder approval in the 2014 AGM.
The performance period for 2014 will be two years assessed at the end of the 2014 financial year, and three years thereafter starting at the end of the 2015 financial year.

4.2 2012 Remuneration policy for executive directors Aligning the interests of the executive directors with shareholders interests has been central in determining remuneration in 2012.
No directors or Executive Committee members received a cash bonus.
Executive director remuneration reflects Company performance with only one director, the 46 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 Remuneration report continued incoming CFO, Jonathan Sorrell, receiving a deferred award and the quantum of this award significantly lower than previous years, and all variable remuneration deferred into shares.
Executive directors owned 1.4% of Company shares as at 31 December 2012.
This harmonises the interests of executive directors with the Groups shareholders through the promotion and encouragement of share ownership, and is subject to achieving return on equity and growth targets.
In line with shareholders interests being managed within a robust governance framework, the Company aims to retain and incentivise high calibre executive directors and align their remuneration with the interests of shareholders by paying competitive base salary and benefits, together with a performance bonus and long-term incentive awards which are linked to: profits and contribution: the achievement of individual objectives, which are consistent with the strategy of the Company and building sustainable profitability: the achievement of the Companys key financial targets: the creation of long-term shareholder value: on going oversight of a robust risk management framework: maintenance of strong capital and liquidity positions: and addition of senior talent, building succession for leadership and setting a strong governance structure for the Boards delegated authorities.
In assessing executive director remuneration, internal relativities within the Company are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
These internal reviews cover the individual elements of base salaries, benefits and total compensation.
Whilst the fixed component of remuneration is sufficiently high to allow the Company to operate a fully flexible bonus policy in order to preserve alignment with shareholder interests, the Remuneration Committee seeks to deliver a high proportion of total compensation as deferral into shares.
Below summarises the current structure of remuneration and 2012 awards for the executive directors.

Emmanuel Roman has also entered into a broader non-compete covenant for an agreed period post termination.
Further the Board has the right at its discretion to require Jonathon Sorrell to comply with a broader non-compete covenant for a period post termination to provide additional protection for the Group provided that if the Board exercises this right and the Company requires him to work out part of his notice, the Company will pay an additional amount up to six months base salary and benefits but excluding any amounts in respect of bonus so that he is not left without income during the time when the Board wishes the non-compete to operate.
4.4 2012 Remuneration outcome for the executive directors Peter Clarke CEO On 10 December Peter Clarke gave 12 months notice, resigning by reason of retirement with the agreement of the Company, standing down as CEO on 28 February 2013.
It has been agreed that he remain on garden leave for 9.5 months, available to assist the Company until the end of his notice period on 10 December 2013 when he retires.
Peter Clarke will be paid his contractual entitlement to basic salary, car allowance and cash pension allowance in lieu of pension contributions during the period of garden leave and continue to benefit from health, life and permanent health insurance benefits during this period.
No cash bonus, share or option awards were made in respect of 2012.
In relation to pre-existing awards under the Performance Share Plan PSP, the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Deferred Bonus Share and Option Plan DBSOP, no discretions were exercised by the Remuneration Committee and Peter Clarkes retention of such awards is subject to the rules of the relevant scheme.
The vesting of any awards under the PSP and ESOS is subject to performance conditions and awards under the PSP are pro-rated to reflect the period of time Peter Clarke was employed during the relevant performance period.
Awards under the DBSOP are subject to forfeiture for detrimental activity prior to the vesting dates.
The option awards were out of the money at the 2012 financial year end.
There was a nil payout for Peter Clarke's 2009 awards from the long-term incentives which completed their three-year performance period in March 2012 as the relevant performance conditions were not met.
Additionally, his 2009 bonus deferred in shares reduced in value with the reduction in Man share price with the result that he had a 64% reduction in the unconditional compensation granted in 2009 at the end of its lock-up period in 2012.
Kevin Hayes FD to 18 June 2012 Kevin Hayes stepped down from the Board of Man Group plc on 18 June 2012 and his 12 months notice period started on the same date.
Kevin Hayes employment terminated on 18 December 2012, after he had spent part of his notice period on garden leave.
Mitigation was included in the leaving arrangements but has not been applicable so a payment of $339,057 in total was made in lieu of salary and benefits for the balance of his notice period.
No cash bonus, share or option awards were made in respect of 2012, and in accordance with the rules of the schemes, pre-existing ESOS awards lapsed.
In relation to pre-existing awards under the PSP and DBSOP, Kevin Hayes retention of such awards shall be subject to the rules of the relevant scheme.
Under the terms of the PSP, Kevin Hayes awards would have lapsed but the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion as permitted by the plan rules, allowing Kevin Hayes to retain existing PSP awards: these will vest subject to performance conditions being met and are pro-rated to reflect the period of time Kevin Hayes was employed during the relevant performance period.
48 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 Remuneration report continued Since Kevin Hayes completed an orderly handover to the satisfaction of the Remuneration Committee, under the DBSOP rules, option awards may vest at the normal vesting dates but the awards are subject to forfeiture for detrimental activity prior to the vesting dates.
These option awards were out of the money at the 2012 financial year end.
There was a nil payout for Kevin Hayes prior year awards from the long-term incentives which completed their three-year performance period in March 2012.
Additionally, his prior year bonus deferred in shares reduced in value with the reduction in Man share price with the result that he had a61% reduction in the unconditional compensation granted in 2009 at the end of its lock-up period in 2012.
Emmanuel Roman COO Emmanuel Roman received a base salary of $1 million for 2012: there will be no increase when he becomes CEO on 28 February 2013.
He does not receive any employer contribution to pension, other non-cash benefits include medical, life and permanent health insurance.
He entered into share lock-up agreements at the closing of the acquisition of GLG pursuant to which Man shares allocated to him as part of the purchase consideration are subject to lock-up terms for a period of three years from the closing date subject to a right to dispose of up to a third of such Man shares after the second anniversary of the closing date and certain customary exceptions from the lock-up.
Emmanuel Roman is a major shareholder: his shareholding at 31 December 2012 was 19,629,418 shares, circa 1% of the Company shareholding.
There is no further performance compensation.
Emmanuel Roman is a non-executive director of Grupo Prisa SA: he retains fees of 218,750 of which 36,667 awarded in shares in respect of this directorship.
Jonathan Sorrell Head of Strategy and Corporate Finance to 17 June 2012 and CFO from 18 June 2012 Jonathan Sorrell was appointed to the Board of Man Group plc as CFO with effect from 18 June 2012 on abase salary of $625,000, a pension allowance and non-cash benefits including medical, life and permanent health insurance.
He is eligible to be considered for a discretionary cash bonus and incentive awards with information on 2012 awards in section 4.6 below.
4.5 Base salary of executive directors Salaries are reviewed annually at the year end taking into account market benchmarks for executives of comparable status, responsibility and skill.
Salaries were reviewed but, for the fifth year, there was no increase.

b Kevin Hayes left the Board with effect from 18 June 2012 and his contract terminated on 18 December 2012.
4.6 Annual performance bonus and deferral With deteriorated Company performance the Remuneration Committee made the decision not to pay any bonus to the CEO, Peter Clarke, COO, Emmanuel Roman, and outgoing Finance Director, Kevin Hayes.
The Remuneration Committee also took a decision not to award any cash bonuses to executive directors.
A deferred bonus award in shares will be made to the CFO as set out in Table R11 below, Jonathan Sorrell, who was appointed in June 2012, having previously been Head of Strategy and Corporate Finance.
In this role he led the negotiation of the FRM acquisition on attractive terms, contributed to the subsequent integration of this business, and assisted in reshaping the groups dividend policy.
During his six months in office Jonathan Sorrell successfully executed cost savings initiatives, led the design and implementation of a new incentive plan for the sales force, increased the realisation of assets on the Groups balance sheet, and headed the efficient execution of our corporate restructuring.
The Board believes that he has made a substantial contribution to the repositioning of our business in 2012 and no member of the Executive Committee has been paid more than Jonathan Sorrell for 2012.
The conditional compensation awarded will be made in shares under the Deferred Bonus and Share Option Plan DBSOP after the close period in March 2013.
The Remuneration Committee awarded DBSOP shares to reflect Jonathan Sorrells promotion to CFO in H2 of 2012, and in light of 2012 being a transitional period for incentive plans with the Executive Incentive Plan replacing existing share and option plans in 2013.
DBSOP share awards will best align Jonathan Sorrells compensation with shareholders interests with the quantum of payout at the end of the three year vesting period directly reflecting total shareholder returns.

The actual amount of remuneration awarded this year, which is eventually received, is subject to these conditions.
Prior period remuneration which is subject to performance conditions, based on subsequent performance, is likely to have a significantly reduced value to the economic value at grant.
The economic value of performance-based share awards is the face value at the time ofgrant, multiplied by a performance factor which represented the expected percentage vesting of awards.
A binomial lattice valuation factor has been applied to this expected vesting percentage to estimate the economic value taking account estimated share price volatility, dividend yield and correlation between vesting outcome and share price.
Share grants for calendar year 2012 will occur in 2013 after the close period.
b Conditional awards for Jonathan Sorrell: DBSOP conditional award of shares $1,482,000.

These are subject to a three year service period.
All share and option awards are conditional and subject to forfeiture if an executive director resigns or the service contract is terminated for misconduct.

On 21 May 2012 dividend accruals of 37,232 shares and 12,410 shares were added to each directors award based on a sterling dividend of 4.38 pence.
On 04 September 2012 dividend accruals of 59,018 shares and 19,672 shares was applied based on a sterling dividend of 6.12 pence.
c Kevin Hayes stepped down from the Board with effect 18 June 2012.
51 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 4.8 Long-term share-based incentive plans 4.8.
1 Eligibility For 2012 executive directors are eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan PSP and Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The PSP and ESOS limit the annual individual awards to 1x and 2x salary respectively.
However, the Remuneration Committee has determined that no awards will be made in respect of 2012 performance in early 2013.
These plans will be discontinued in 2013 with the introduction of the new Executive Incentive Plan.
2 Dilution Man share plans comply with the current ABI Guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over any 10 year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any 10 year period for discretionary plans.
Share plan awards are within these limits.
3 Performance and service conditions for prior year awards Both the PSP and ESOS have a three year performance period with vesting subject to achieving performance conditions.
The PSP has a four-year service period.
There are no re-testing opportunities should performance measures not be met at the end of the third year.
The performance conditions for the plans are Net Management Fee Income Growth NMFIG and Adjusted Return on Equity AROE.
The three year performance period was chosen as appropriate for the business and the period over which growth and returns should be achieved.
Net management fee income is the product of two components, namely the funds under management and the net management fee margins.
Net management fee margins are after deduction of all fixed costs and variable costs not attributable to performance fees.
The net margin excludes adjusting items and net finance income costs.
The return performance condition measures the efficiency with which Man invests or returns capital.
The adjustment to the ROE measure is to calculate equity excluding the Boards determination of any surplus capital not currently being utilised in the business.
The surplus capital is additional capital in excess of a the minimum regulatory capital of the Group Pillar 1 capital adjusted by the Individual Capital Guidance percentage agreed with the FSA plus any specific add-on, plus b a capital planning buffer set by the FSA, plus c a Board cushion as set by the Board from time to time to give operating flexibility.
Notional interest incurred on surplus capital is deducted in calculating AROE.
Capital strategy is a matter for the Board: executive directors can only influence the policy within the Board framework.
The Remuneration Committee has previously considered using relative return performance measures.
However, since the Remuneration Committee is not aware of any listed companies of substantial size whose main business activities are comparable in nature and scale to that of Man Group, such measures were not considered appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee therefore sets performance conditions to target absolute returns for its shareholders that are designed to be both challenging and appropriate given the regulated nature of the Companys business.

Vesting of awards granted under the PSP and ESOS in 2009 and 2010 is inter-dependent upon AROE and NMFIG.
8% of the award vests for achieving positive AROE and if NMFIG is 10%.
The proportion of award vesting increases incrementally so that the award vests in full for achieving either AROE of 10% and NMFIG of 30%, or AROE of 30% and NMFIG of 20%.
None of the award vests if AROE is negative.
5 Remuneration outcome for 2009 The performance conditions are stretching.
As with the previous year there was nil vesting in the current financial period for PSP and ESOS awards granted in 2009 at the completion of the three-year performance period and these awards have lapsed in 2012.
This is the third year when ESOS has had nil vesting and second year when PSP had nil vesting.
The impact has been to reduce the 2009 compensation income for the Chief Executive and Finance Director as set out in Tables R17 and R18.
