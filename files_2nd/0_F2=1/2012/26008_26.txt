Reserves i Share premium The share premium account represented amounts received on the issue of share capital in excess of nominal value and was not a distributable reserve.
On 9 June 2011, the Companys share premium reserve was, with the sanction of the Court, cancelled and an amount of 255.7m was transferred to a distributable reserve.
ii Capital redemption reserve On 9 June 2011, the Companys capital redemption reserve of 54.1m was, with the sanction of the Court, cancelled and an amount of 54.1m was transferred to a distributable reserve.
Thus the balance on the Company's capital redemption reserve at 31 December 2012 and 2011 was nil.
"iii Own share reserve The Group operates an employee benefit trust ""EBT"" for the purpose of satisfying certain retention awards to employees."
The holdings of this trust include certain shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group.
These shares are classied as own shares.
They are held for the short term to meet future award requirements and are recorded, at cost, as own shares.
At 31 December 2012, 42.5m 2011: 82.5m ordinary shares beneficially owned by senior employees were subject to restrictions which, in some circumstances, require the Group to repurchase the shares at their nominal value, and this liability is shown within current trade and other payables.
These restrictions are released over the next three years with the majority being released in 2013.
The shares are held within the Groups EBT and, together with a further 20.9m 2011: 20.9m shares held for the purpose of satisfying share option obligations to employees, are treated as own shares with a cost of 1.3m 2011: 2.1m.
