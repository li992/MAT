This resulted in lower revenue in CMD69473 LTE MIMO indoor broadband ceiling mount the area of asset tracking, but leaves the business well positioned antenna for use in ofces airports to focuson more profitable products and faster-growing segments going forward.
Wireless Bridge WB enterprise-grade connectivity The acquisition of Summit added to Lairds existing capabilities to subsystem module for use in hospital medical devices offer non-cellular M2M modules in Wi-Fi to enable wireless systems to function in particularly harsh RF environments, such as in factories, Smart LTE MIMO antenna for use in automotive global warehouses and hospitals.
navigation satellite systems BLE600 Bluetooth Low Energy BLE modules enabling Wireless Automation and short range wireless connectivity for ultra-low power sensor ControlSolutions applications innovated in 2012 to be ofcially launched in Wireless Automation and Control Solutions industrial and early 2013 transportation markets have been less robust, as some replacement rail programmes were deferred in 2012, particularly in North America, with revenues 6% lower.
After-market services revenues were solid.
Demand is increasing for more comprehensive wireless networking with diagnostic software, which should command higher margins.
Infrastructure Antennae Revenue from the Infrastructure Antennae Systems business was 25% higher as a result of a sustained level of demand across multiple market segments, including WLAN, RFID, cellular networks and public safety.
This demand has been driven by the continuing need for increased bandwidth and coverage required to make use of smartphones and other connected devices.
This business also experienced good demand for antennae used within gaming consoles in the consumer entertainment market.
The demand for increased connectivity in everyday life is expected to accelerate.
More advanced solutions are being required as the industry evolves, which in turn creates sustained demand for Lairds products and systems.
The rise of infotainment in the automotive industry, the proliferation of wireless connectivity within public infrastructure, and the provision for 4G in the telecoms market all contribute to the increasing demand for Lairds products andsolutions.
