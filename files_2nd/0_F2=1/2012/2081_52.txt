Reserves for EKATI Core Zone were estimated at 1.2mm cut-off.
2 Richards Bay Minerals Resources and Reserves are reported as at 31 December 2011.
3 Jansen %MgO is used as a measure of carnallite KCl.
6H O content where per cent carnallite equivalent %MgO x 6.3918.
However, in the above statement 2 2 the main source of the stated MgO content is the soluble portion of the dolomitic clay seams.
The Mineral Resource is stated for the Lower Patience Lake LPL potash unit.
A stratigraphic cut-off based on clay seams has been applied.
A cut-off grade of 15% K 0 was applied to the resource estimate, no further modifying or mining 2 extraction factors have been applied to the Mineral Resource.
