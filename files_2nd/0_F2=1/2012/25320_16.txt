Ben Murphy Company Secretary 6 March 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 53 A statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2012, which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
The main work of the Committee this year has involved a review of incentives for executive directors and senior executives, focusing in particular on the long-term elements.
The objective has been to put in place a remuneration framework that will focus the key executives on driving the Company strategy over the short, medium and long-term which in turn will drive performance for shareholders.
Following a review of existing arrangements, which included feedback from senior executives, it was felt that the absolute total shareholder return TSR measure in the Performance Share Plan PSP and Deferred Share Plan DSP matching shares should be complemented with the key drivers of TSR to provide a more motivational incentive for executives whilst maintaining shareholder alignment.
The Committee believes a sensible balance is for one third of long-term incentive awards to vest on each of three measures: TSR, earnings per share EPS and growth in revenue net of impairment.
To reect the Committees desire to ensure that executive directors are incentivised sufciently to deliver long-term, sustainable growth and that the balance between xed and variable elements of remuneration is Tony Hales at the right level, the normal maximum award size under Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the PSP will be increased to 125% from 100%.
Following consultation with our major institutional shareholders in the context of this change, the proposed targets for The UK Government Department of Business Innovation maximum vesting have been increased and the vesting & Skills BIS is currently proposing changes to the level for threshold performance has been reduced to structure and contents of Directors Remuneration 25% for 2013 onwards.
