A central treasury department that reports directly to the Group Finance Director and operates according to objectives, policies and authorities approved by the Board, manages these risks.
The overall policy objective is to use financial instruments to manage financial risks arising from the underlying business activities and therefore the Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying financial exposure.
More details are set out in note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Funding and Liquidity The Groups operations are financed by a combination of retained profits, equity and borrowings.
Borrowings are generally raised at Group level from banks and then lent to operating subsidiaries.
The Group maintains sufficient available committed borrowing facilities to meet any forecasted funding requirements.
