GOING CONCERN The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Investment Adviser Report.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and its liquidity position are described in the Investment Adviser Report.
In particular, the current economic conditions have created a number of risks and uncertainties for the Group and these are set out in the Risks and Risk Management section on pages 25 to 27.
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group and the exposure of the Group to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are discussed in note 28 of the Financial Statements.
The Group continues to meet Group and individual entity requirements and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Groups cash resources.
In February 2013, the Group secured a revolving credit facility of 150 million.
As at 31 December 2012 the Group had net current assets of 35.4 million.
Since then, the Group has completed a further third party acquisition for 3.2 million.
This acquisition was funded using cash at the bank meaning JLIFs revolving credit facility remains undrawn and available for future acquisitions.
JLIF has sufficient cash balances to meet other current obligations as they fall due while all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
The Directors have reviewed Group forecasts and projections which cover a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report, taking into account reasonably possible changes in investment and trading performance.
The Group has sufficient financial resources together with long term contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
On this basis, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and having made due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
