Marketing activities delivered Adjusted EBIT of $ 435million, 38% lower than in 2011.
1100000 The decrease was driven by a combination of low volatility and weak freight markets, 1000000 which limited arbitrage opportunities, and our residual direct long wet freight ex- 120000 900000 posure.
This wet freight exposure will decline materially in 2013.

The strong performance was driven by the significant in- 500000 crease of oil production from the Aseng oil field, representing its first full year of pro- 60000 400000 duction, and the acquisitions of Optimum and Umcebo.

At the same time, current spot coal prices mean that many of the worlds producers are unable to make a reasonable return on their assets.

Coal Atlantic markets Increased US exports, displaced in a low domestic natural gas price environment, manifestly contributed to significant thermal coal price declines during H12012.
The situation stabilised during H22012 with a modest recovery on the back of healthy coal consumption across most European markets, due to positive coal versus natural gas spreads and limited availability of hydro and other renewables alternatives.
End of year API2 and API4 prices were down 20% and 15% respectively in 2012, compared to 2011.
Pacific markets Increased exports from Australia and Indonesia, coupled with some customer non-performance, induced downward pressure on prices at the beginning of 2012.
However, strong overall demand from the traditional Chinese and Indian markets, together with improved economic expectations, allowed markets to recover in H22012, with Australias Newcastle index making significant gains towards the end of the year.
Metallurgical markets were relatively depressed throughout the year due to the macroeconomic concerns and slowing steel demand in most markets.
Signs of a recovery appeared towards the end of the year, with significant increases in spot prices.
Oil Nearby Brent started 2012 at $107 per barrel and finished at $111 per barrel, but this belied a yearly range of $89 to $126, slightly wider than the equivalent range for 2011.
In particular, H12012 saw significant price volatility, wide day ranges and fast price moves, reminiscent of the darker days of the financial crisis.
Uncertainty over Greece and the Eurozone, combined with unclear fiscal and monetary policy backdrops were all contributory factors.
At the same time, reasonable refining margins and a renewed focus on emerging market demand provided trading opportunities.
H22012 experienced less volatility, reflecting the broad trend in capital markets and seemingly more market optimism in a managed outcome for the economic crisis.
The growing supply of domestic crude oil in the US, the visible manifestation of the shale oil revolution, provoked an increasing dislocation of WTI from other global benchmarks.
The WTI Brent spread started the year at $9 per barrel and closed at $19 per barrel.
Brent term structure tended to backwardation during the year.
| Annual Report 2012 | 55 MARKETINg Highlights Generally low volatility across the oil and coal markets in H22012 and the protracted weak freight environment provided fewer arbitrage opportunities, contributing to a reduced performance from energy marketing compared to 2011.
A direct, but declining, long wet freight tanker exposure continued to provide headwinds during 2012, however, as we look at 2013, light can be seen at the end of this tunnel.
Adjusted marketing EBITDA and EBIT for 2012 were $ 494 million and $ 435 million respectively, a decrease, compared to 2011, of 32% and 38%.

Volumes for the more specialised metallurgical products were stable year-on-year with a focus on maintaining existing relationships.
Oil Traded volumes, on an overall basis, increased significantly by 39% from 2.3million barrels per day in 2011 to 3.2million barrels per day in 2012.
Higher volumes of crude oil, with Russian origin barrels amongst others a key driving factor, contributed half the gain.
The remainder of the gain was derived from our marine bunker fuels affiliate Chemoil, into the Oil group figures.
56 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN INduSTRIAL ACTIVITIES Highlights Energy products industrial performance delivered a significantly stronger performance during 2012 mainly driven by the growth in oil production volumes and the associated strong profit margins from the Aseng oil field.
Own sourced coal production volumes were also up significantly during 2012, following the acquisitions of Optimum and Umcebo in South Africa, and a modest increase at Prodeco, despite a three month strike at its La Jagua mine.
Notwithstanding the volume growth, realised coal prices were substantially lower in 2012, resulting in a decline in overall coal EBITDA of 5%.
Total industrial revenues for energy products were $3,641million, up 58% from $2,309million in 2011.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT for 2012 were $983million and $594million, up 72% and 58% compared to $571million and $375million in 2011.
Glencores ownership interest in the Aseng field is 23.75%.
58 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN OPERATIONAL HIgHLIgHTS Prodeco Glencore interest: 100% Own production for 2012 was 14.8million tonnes, up 1% on 2011.
The significant growth at Calenturitas was offset by lower production at the La Jagua mine, due to a three month strike that concluded in October 2012.
Prodecos expansion project is progressing to plan, excluding the short term impact of the La Jagua strike, and remains on track to deliver annualised production of 20million tonnes by 2014.
The construction of the new direct loading port, Puerto Nuevo, is also on track and to budget, with commissioning expected in H12013.
Puerto Nuevo will provide substantially higher annual throughput capacity with a lower operating cost per tonne.
South African Coal Glencore interest: Shanduka Coal: 49.99%, Umcebo Mining: 43.66% and Optimum Coal: 67.01% 2012 own production was 27.1milliontonnes, reflecting a significant increase compared to 2011.
This increase largely resulted from the consolidation of production from Optimum and Umcebo from 1January2012.
South African Coal is currently focused on a number of expansion and development projects which are progressing well.
At Umcebo, the Wonderfontein project started production and railed its first coal during December 2012.
At Shanduka and Umcebo, the definitive feasibility studies relating to the Springboklaagte and Argent projects remain on track to be completed in April2013.
At Optimum, construction has started at the Pullenshope underground brownfield project with first coal expected in Q22013, while licensing for the Koornfontein project has been delayed slightly to Q12013, with construction expected to start in Q22013.
In addition, South African Coal, along with the other shareholders, has recently taken an active role in the management of the Kusipongo project at Kangra Coal 30% owned by Shanduka Coal.
Oil Exploration & Production Glencore interest: Block I: 23.75% Block O: 25.0% The Aseng field Block I in Equatorial Guinea has continued to perform well during 2012, producing 22.57millionbarrels of cumulative gross production at an average gross rate of approximately 61,700barrels per day.
Development of the Alen field Block O in Equatorial Guinea remains on budget with first production scheduled for Q32013.
All of the development wells have been drilled and completed and construction of the production platform continues as planned.
Glencores first operated exploration well on the Oak prospect in the Bolongo Block, offshore Cameroon, was successfully drilled and declared an oil discovery in July2012.
The appraisal programme is planned for H22013.
