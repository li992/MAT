Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Business review Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 23 August 2012: Diageo is a strong business, getting stronger and the results we released this morning show that very clearly.
We have increased our presence in the faster growing markets of the world, through both acquisitions and strong organic growth.
We have enhanced our leading brand positions globally, through effective marketing and industry leading innovation and we have strengthened our routes to market.
6% organic top line growth, 9% operating profit growth and 60 basis points of margin expansion is a strong performance and demonstrates our commitment to delivering efficient growth.
A year ago I set out our expectations for the medium term and these results put us firmly on track to meet those goals.
In F12, we have continued to invest to ensure this business is well positioned for the future.
Our confidence in the achievement of our medium term guidance is underscored by the 8% recommended increase in our final dividend.

80 Diageo Annual Report 2012 Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Net borrowings The groups net borrowings are measured at amortised cost with the exception of borrowings designated in fair value hedge relationships, interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency forwards and swaps.
For borrowings designated in fair value hedge relationships, Diageo recognises a fair value adjustment for the risk being hedged in the balance sheet, whereas interest rate hedging instruments and foreign currency forwards and swaps are measured at fair value.
Analysis of net borrowings is the following: 30 June 2012 2011 2010 million million million Overdrafts 38 12 55 Other borrowings due within one year 1,192 1,435 532 Borrowings due within one year 1,230 1,447 587 Borrowings due between one and three years 2,645 2,441 2,189 Borrowings due between three and five years 1,521 1,741 2,732 Borrowings due after five years 3,233 2,566 3,256 Fair value of foreign currency forwards and swaps 210 182 227 Fair value of interest rate hedging instruments 3 58 191 Finance lease liabilities 230 79 61 Gross borrowings 8,646 8,034 8,407 Offset by: Cash and cash equivalents 1,076 1,584 1,453 Net borrowings 7,570 6,450 6,954 In the year ended 30 June 2012, the group repaid bonds of $900 million 566 million and 750 million 605 million.
The group borrowed $2,500 million 1,548 million, consisting of $1,000 million of 1.5% bonds due May 2017, $1,000 million of 2.875% bonds due May 2022, and $500 million of 4.25% bonds due May 2042.
In the year ended 30 June 2012 the group mainly financed its day to day operations through issuing short term commercial paper.
In the year ended 30 June 2011, the group repaid a $500 million 313 million bond.
In the year ended 30 June 2010, the group borrowed $500 million 305 million in the form of a bond that matures in January 2015 with a coupon of 3.25%.
A $300 million 184 million medium term note and a $750 million 493 million bond were repaid.
In addition, $696 million 466 million of outstanding 7.375% notes due in January 2014 were exchanged in May 2010 for $696 million 466 million of 4.828% notes due in July 2020 plus an aggregate cash payment to holders of $125 million 84 million.
The debt exchange did not represent a substantial modification of the term of the existing liability and was therefore not treated as an extinguishment of the original debt.
Based on average monthly net borrowings and net interest charge, the effective interest rate for the year ended 30 June 2012 was 4.7% 2011 4.9%: 2010 4.8%.
For this calculation, net interest charge excludes fair value adjustments to derivative financial instruments and borrowings and average monthly net borrowings include the impact of interest rate swaps that are no longer in a hedge relationship but exclude the market value adjustment for cross currency interest rate swaps.
Net borrowings designated in net investment hedge relationships amounted to 4,249 million as at 30 June 2012 2011 5,409 million: 2010 5,451 million.
The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows: As at 30 June 2012 million Expiring within one year 745 Expiring between one and two years Expiring after two years 1,484 2,229 Capital structure and targeted credit rating The groups management is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both by investing in the businesses and brands so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency, maximise flexibility and give the appropriate level of access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
This is achieved by targeting a range of ratios which are currently broadly consistent with an A band credit rating.
Diageo would consider modifying these ratios in order to effect strategic initiatives within its stated goals, which could have an impact on its rating.
