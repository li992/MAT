organisations that are working Strategic objectives toward creating a sustainable future Our strategy is a long-term one and our platform is durable and scalable.
We are unique in that we have developed our business from scratch out of a domestic position in an emerging and preserving market.
We have a strong culture and believe in giving our people the freedom to create.
We the future security aim to build deep relationships where we operate as a respected investment partner with the worlds most influential asset owners.
Our business is about investment performance, clients, of the worlds occasional innovation and insight.
The firm seeks to create a profitable partnership between rich cultural and clients, shareholders and employees and our aim is to exceed our clients investment and client service expectations and to manage their money to the highest possible standard.
Sustainability considerations In our role as a global asset manager, we recognise the responsibility that comes with being long-term stewards of our clients assets.
Key to this responsibility is continually ensuring that corporate governance and business integrity are a fundamental part of how we operate.
Our primary goal in doing this is both to benefit our clients and also to improve the broader environmental and social realms in which we invest and operate.
Alongside the financial objectives that we set for ourselves as business, we also categorise our environmental, social and governance activity into three areas: Commitment to stewardship and our investment approach We are signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment and we endorse the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles on corporate governance.
Our detailed Stewardship Principles, which are integrated into our research, are publicly available and provide guidance on our approach to corporate governance.
We are committed to seeing environmental, social and governance factors as elements that need to be considered as part of our investment analysis and mandate implementation, and where appropriate these are integrated into our processes.
The investment teams have experienced some significant developments during the 2012 financial year in the areas of environmental, social and governance integration, including the establishment of an environmental, social and governance team in London and additional environmental, social and governance research tools and training.
Integration is a journey and we expect this area to develop further over time.
This approach, in our view, is central to the way in which we carry out our fiduciary responsibilities.
Key aspects include taking an active and transparent approach to voting and engagement with the companies in our portfolios.
We also aim to encourage and reward better corporate governance and business integrity by seeking to play a meaningful role in helping to develop the framework for investment and ownership within the various jurisdictions in which we invest.
Full details can be found on the Investec Asset Management website.
People We are deeply aware of our broader responsibility to society at large and, more specifically, to the communities in which we have an investment footprint.
With this in mind, we seek to make a positive impact on society by focusing on education initiatives that support local communities and the environments in which they operate.
We are proud to be associated with a number of non-profit organisations that are working toward creating a sustainable future and preserving the future security of the worlds rich cultural and natural heritage.
Amongst other initiatives, our work has seen us support a Investec integrated annual report 2012 | Divisional review 63 Asset Management continued number of projects run by the Tusk Trust, which has supported wildlife conservation, community development, and environmental education in Africa since 1990.
In South Africa, our partnership with the JL Zwane Community Centre dates back to 2003, and has seen the staffrun charity providing ongoing support.
The firm provided the means to build what is today a modern facility serving the needs of the entire community.
Our support of the Starfish Great Hearts Foundations US awareness campaign funds education-related projects in South Africa for young people whose families have been affected by Aids.
In addition, our staff members are involved in Investecs acclaimed work with Arrival Education in the UK and we are a supporter of the Princes Trust, both organisations which aim to support the development of young people into successful adulthood by working in partnership with the UK business community.
Further sponsorships include our support of the Make a Difference Foundation, and the establishment of a dedicated community fund, aimed at supporting small ad-hoc community initiatives.
Planet We recognise that our duty to act in the best long-term interests of all our stakeholders, including staff members and clients, encompasses the objective of reducing the long-term business risks to our environment.
In line with this we are signatories of the Carbon Disclosure Project and their Carbon Action initiative, which calls for business to monitor the cost-effective management and reduction of carbon emissions and currently represents total assets under management of USD10 trillion.
Furthermore, recognising that climate change is an increasingly relevant investment issue, with potentially profound economic and societal implications, Investec Asset Management has undertaken research to assess the impact of climate change on shareholder value in South Africa.
Full report can be found on the Investec Asset Management website.
The environment matters to us, and as such ongoing staff involvement in environmental activities takes place primarily through our locally based Green Teams.
They represent groups of employees who seek to raise awareness of how to become more environmentally aware both as a firm and as individuals.
In addition, we have implemented the government-backed Cycle2Work initiative for employees.
Conclusion In summary, we apply the aggregate financial influence of our clients and the full abilities of our investment team to be effective stewards of the companies in which we invest.
We care about the environment and are committed to do our best to nurture the planet on which we live.
Finally, we acknowledge that the firm and the staff in their personal capacity as well need to plough back into the communities which we serve through social investment.
Looking forward The momentum of our business is positive and we have benefited from sustained performance over many years.
Weak markets will continue to affect our flows, revenues and profits, but our broad range of investment capabilities is well positioned to serve current and future investor demand.
With this as a foundation and with our global client reach and institutional market focus, we have managed to steer a stable course in this uncertain climate.
However, given the world is subject to dramatic changes in regulatory agendas, demographic shifts and relative risk perceptions, we continue to be vigilant and the key risks to our business remain market levels, key staff retention, reputational risk and investment performance.
We believe that our long-term strategy will continue to create substantial value for clients and shareholders alike.
