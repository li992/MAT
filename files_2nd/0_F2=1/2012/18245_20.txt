Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Directors Report The Directors have pleasure in presenting their report together with the financial statements for the year to 31 March 2012.
Principal Activities of the Group Daejan Holdings PLC is a holding company whose principal activity, carried on through its subsidiary undertakings, is property investment.

The majority of the Groups property portfolio comprises commercial, industrial and residential premises throughout the UK, but the Group also has a significant portfolio of commercial and residential properties on the eastern seaboard of the USA.
The Groups business model is generally to hold its investment property for the long term to generate rental income and capital appreciation, funded wherever possible by retained earnings and long term finance: consequently major sales of property are infrequent.

Financial Objectives and Policies and Exposure to Financial Risk The Group operates a cautious financial policy within clear authorities on a non-speculative and long term basis in order to enable the Group to carry on its business in confidence and with strength.
The Group aims to ensure that the cost of capital is kept to a minimum through the maintenance of its many long standing relationships with leading banks and other financial institutions.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of sudden and unexpected rises in finance costs by way of fixed rate debt and financial derivative instruments whilst retaining some flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
There is no obligation or present intention to repay the Groups borrowings other than at maturity.
Payment Policy It is the Groups policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each transaction, to ensure that those suppliers are aware of those terms and to abide by the agreed terms of payment, providing that it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services Page 12
