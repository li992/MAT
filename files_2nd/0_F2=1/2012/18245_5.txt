Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Chairmans Statement continued New investment and funding During the year, we invested 25.6 million 2011 30.0 million in acquisitions and additions to our existing portfolio.
The principal new acquisition was 139 143 Oxford Street, W1 at a cost of 13.3 million.
This provides a useful consolidation with our existing adjacent holding in Berwick Street, W1.
I have commented in previous statements on the limited number of institutions in the UK market offering longer term funding.
Whilst finance is readily available, it is generally for periods of five years or less and on unattractive terms.
This is principally due to the stringencies imposed on the banks by regulatory authorities.
Shorter term finance does have a part to play in the funding mix, but we take a long term perspective when investing in new properties and developments and we believe that such major projects should largely be based on longer term finance.
We are therefore sourcing much of our new borrowing requirements from other long term lenders such as insurance companies and US savings banks.
