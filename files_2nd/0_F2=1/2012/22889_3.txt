The Companys liquidity will change following the Restructuring as outlined on page 16 as the Company transitions to become a feeder fund of AOFL II.
In addition, underlying hedge funds including AOFL II often have the ability to suspend redemptions, restrict redemptions to a specified percentage of the underlying funds net assets e. g. a gate, and or restrict investors from redeeming their interest in certain investments e. g. side pockets, all of which would reduce the liquidity of the Company.
In particular, the likelihood that a manager may suspend redemptions, invoke a gate or side pocket certain investments is likely to increase during times of market stress that cause investors to redeem from hedge funds.
