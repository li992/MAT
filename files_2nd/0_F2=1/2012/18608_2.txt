Strategy and Financial Position As we have stated previously, our two key strategic objectives for 2012 have been rstly to increase the proportion of profit generated from rents and fees Robin Broadhurst andsecondly to reduce our overall net debt within the Chairman business.
We have made good progress in both regards.

Our fee income has increased from 6.9m to 10.0m, up 45% in the year.
This focus on the composition of profit will be maintained in 2013 as we continue to build sustainable sources of income and further strengthen and diversify the companys platform.
