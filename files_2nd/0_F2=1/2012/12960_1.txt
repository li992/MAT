The cover In 1995, Randgold Resources Limited Randgold set out to build a world-class gold business in Africa, with African assets managed by Africans.
Step by carefully calculated step, it has steadily advanced towards that goal, discovering multi-million ounce gold deposits, developing and operating profitable mines, and creating real value for all its stakeholders.
Today, Randgold ranks among the leaders of its industry and is one of the few that can project a rising production prole on the solid foundation of an organically expanding resource base.
And now, with the development of the giant Kibali project in the DRC, scheduled to pour its first gold by the end of 2013, Randgold is taking its next big step towards sustainably profitable growth.
