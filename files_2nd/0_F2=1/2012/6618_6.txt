1.6 | Key performance indicators Glencores financial and sustainable development key performance indicators KPIs provide some measure of our performance against key drivers of our strategy.
Adjusted EBIT Adjusted EBIT is a measure that provides insight into Glencores overall business 6000 performance a combination of cost management, seizing market opportunities and 5000 growth and the corresponding flow driver towards achieving an industry leading 4000 3000 return on equity.

2010 2011 2012 2012 Adjusted EBIT was down 17% to $4,470million compared to 2011 due to lower contributions from our industrial activities which were affected by generally lower year on year average commodity prices for the key commodities which we and our associates primarily Xstrata produce.
Funds from operations FFO FFO is a measure that reflects Glencores ability to generate cash for investment, debt 4000 servicing and distributions to shareholders as well as an indication of Glencores ability 3000 to deliver against its growth and financial flexibility objectives.
FFO comprises cash 2000 provided by operating activities before working capital changes less tax and net inter est payments plus dividends received and adding back listing related expenses in 2011.
1000 0 2012 FFO was up 17% to $4,115million compared to $3,522million in 2011, reflecting 2010 2011 2012 the higher Adjusted EBITDA from marketing activities.
Net debt FFO to net debt Net debt is an absolute measure of how we are managing our balance sheet and capi 15000 60 tal structure, while of equal or greater importance, the relationship of FFO to net debt 12500 50 is an indication of our financial flexibility and strength, a key driver of our strategy.
10000 40 7500 30 Net debt is defined as total current and noncurrent borrowings less cash and cash 5000 20 equivalents, marketable securities and readily marketable inventory.
$ 359million of net debt was assumed in the Viterra acquisi 1 Adjusted for Viterra acquisition tion and $ 3.6billion of net debt was incurred to finance Glencores effective share of the equity purchase consideration.
Adjusting for the increase in net debt attribut able to the Viterra acquisition completed midDecember 2012, net debt would be $ 11,457million, a decrease of $ 1,481million compared to 2011.
The ratio FFO to Net debt adjusted for the Viterra acquisition improved from 27.2% in 2011 to 35.9% in 2012.
A healthy positive free cash flow generation FFO is expected from the Viterra asset base going forward, which is expected to offer support to debt coverage ratios and deleveraging initiatives into the future.
Fatalities We deeply regret the 22 fatalities at our managed operations in 2012.
This was an increase compared to 2011 and 2010 both of which saw 18 fatalities and included a 25 tragic car accident in Argentina where four people lost their lives.

The LTIFR is 12 calculated based on the total number of injuries per million hours worked by both 10 employees and contractors 8 6 In 2012, our group LTIFR fell from 3.58 to 2.84.
This improvement primarily came from 4 our metals and minerals and agricultural product segments, while the energy prod 2 ucts segment saw a slight increase however, this was from a much lower original rate.
0 2010 2011 2012 Metals and minerals representing 70% of our industrial workforce reduced its LTIFR from 3.06 to 2.37, agriculture representing 10% from 12.61 to 10.78, while energy Metals and minerals products representing 20% increased from 0.81 to 0.86.
Energy products Agricultural products Number of Class A environmental incidents We undertake an extensive and complex range of activities, which are not limited to the extraction of natural resources but also include significant logistical operations such as maritime transportation.
One way in which we measure the robustness of our procedures and policies is the frequency of Class A environmental incidents in the group.
This is our classification for disastrous or closeto disastrous incidents and involves accidents or spills with a major environmental impact and a longterm effect, reversible only by longterm remediation with aftercare.
No Class A environmental incidents were reported in 2012 as in 2011 and 2010.

Scope1 18 includes emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces and 15 vehicles vessels, and Scope 2 consists of those generated in creating the electricity 12 9 the majority of contributions, steam, heat, etc, provided to the organisation by exter 6 final utility companies.
