Infield development successes PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT Average working interest production in Pakistan during 2012 was 15,600 boepd net to Premier, three per cent higher than in 2011 15,100 boepd, despite the start of natural production decline in some existing wells.
The higher production was mainly due to successful infill drilling and the tie-in of exploration and development wells in the Kadanwari and Bhit Badhra gas fields.
Production from the Qadirpur gas field was broadly stable in 2012, averaging 3,700 boepd net to Premier compared to 3,750 boepd in 2011.
This was due to the good performance of the wellhead compressors and to the better than expected support from the extended reach wells drilled in the northern part of the reservoir.
Specifically, the development wells QP-44, QP-45, QP-46 and HRL-6 were successfully drilled, completed and tied-in to production in 2012 while QP-48 and QP-49 are currently being drilled.
In addition, the Government of Pakistan has approved a new price for Qadirpur gas, increasing it by 11 per cent, applicable with effect from December 2012.
Production from the Kadanwari gas field averaged 2,600 boepd net to Premier during 2012, 27 per cent higher than in 2011.
This was as a result of sustained production from K-19 and the increase in field production following the tie-in to facilities of the successful exploration wells K-27 and K-28 and the K-29 development well.
The pilot programme at Kadanwari to test the tight gas potential in the Lower Goru formation is ongoing.
The K-3 DirB vertical well has been tested and is currently being tied-in to the facilities while the testing of the K-1 DirA vertical well commenced in January.
Six tight sand intervals were fracked and tested separately at the K-3 DirB well with total initial flow of 3.4 mmscfd which reduced to 1.8 mmscfd upon clean up.
This proved that all the tight intervals in the Kadanwari area can flow gas after fracking, while the G-Sand and B-Sand have demonstrated relatively better flow potentials.
These two intervals are being tested in the K-1 DirA well where preliminary results are encouraging as the G-Sand flowed 0.5 mmscfd prior to clean up.
All fracked B-Sand intervals also flowed gas to the surface while rates are likely to improve after further rigless clean up.
The G-Sand will be targeted in the K-31H horizontal pilot well in 2013.
The Zamzama gas field produced 5,800 boepd net to Premier during 2012 2011: 5,800 boepd.
This was mainly due to continuous good performance of front-end compressors and the Zam-8 infill well being tied-in ahead of schedule.
Sub-surface studies were completed in early 2012, following which two infill wells, Zam 8 and Zam 9, were drilled back-to-back in the second half of the year.
While the Zam-8 infill well was tied-in to the system in November, first gas from the Zam-9 infill well was achieved in January 2013.
Production from the Bhit Badhra gas fields was stable in 2012, averaging 3,500 boepd net to Premier.
This was mainly due to the successful drilling and tie in of the Badhra B North-1 exploration well.
In addition, the Bhit-15 development well, which was spudded on 4 November, was tied-in to the facilities in January 2013, further helping to offset the natural decline from the existing wells on the Bhit Badhra gas fields.
A revised development plan for the Zarghun South gas field was submitted to the Pakistan Government in May 2012 following certification of 64 bcf of tight gas in the Dunghan formation and 12 bcf of conventional gas in the Chiltan Mughalkot formations by independent consultants DeGolyer and MacNaughton.
The revised development plan has been approved for application of premium Tight Gas Policy prices and, as a result, the joint venture commenced development work on the project early in 2013.
All costs pertaining to Premiers 3.75 per cent interest in the project are carried by the operator.
Pakistan continued EXPLORATION Two exploration wells, K-30 on the Kadanwari gas field, and Badhra B North-1 BBN-1 on the Badhra gas field, were drilled in 2012.
Both wells were successful and have subsequently been tied-in to infrastructure.
The K-30 exploration well was spudded in January 2012 and tested gas with a flow rate of 52 mmscfd through a 60 64 inch choke.
The well was tied-in to the system in April 2012.
Following this better than expected result, two more wells are planned in 2013 in the eastern part of the existing lease.
The BBN-1 well was drilled in September 2012 and made a significant gas discovery in the Kirthar Foldbelt.
The well was drilled to a total depth of 2,450 metres and encountered a new sand interval, 44 metres thick, in the Mughalkot reservoir formation which tested gas at a flow rate of 31 mmscfd.
The well was tied-in to the Bhit facilities in November.
The joint venture has agreed to drill an appraisal well, Badhra B North-1 West, in the second quarter of 2013 to assess the full potential of the 100 bcf discovery as part of an appraisal programme submitted to the government.
The planned Badhra-6 development well will be deepened in 2013 to test the potential of the Parh Limestone.
In addition, the Badhra South-1 Deep exploration well will be drilled in 2013 to test the potential of a deeper lead at the Lower Goru level.
Outlook Continue the infield development programme Ongoing near field exploration drilling planned for 2013 Three well pilot project to evaluate the tight gas potential at Kadanwari to be completed in 2013
