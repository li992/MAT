Low-grade Stockpile was no longer included in the Ore Reserve estimate.
The mining concessions are due to expire on 30 September 2012 and we have applied for an extension of these.
If this extension is not granted, Cerro Matoso S. A. has an underlying mining agreement with the Colombian Government that grants Cerro Matoso S. A. the rights to continue mining and producing through to 2029 with a further extension of 15 years possible.
