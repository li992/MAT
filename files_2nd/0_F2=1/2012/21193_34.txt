Our annual bonus plan is based on key financial, employee and customer Scott Wheway performance indicators.

However, we have taken account of the underpin metrics to ensure bonus outcomes that are better aligned with the creation of shareholder value.
Following careful consideration of those metrics the Committee decided that executive directors would not receive a bonus for 2012: Chairman fees John McFarlane indicated he did not wish any increase in the fees paid to him when he undertook his executive role in the period from May 2012 to 31 December 2012: and ACAP ACDT the Aviva Capital Accumulation Plan ACAP and the Aviva Cash Deferral Trust ACDT will close from 31 March 2014.

Notes: 1 ROE is used as an absolute measure of performance, and is commonly used amongst our peers.
Targets are set annually within the context of the Companys three-year business plan.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three-year period against a target return.
2 Relative TSR is a commonly used method of determining performance against a set of suitable peers, providing a view of relative performance against those peers.
TSR is calculated by measuring total capital gains or losses accruing in the period if shares are held continuously and dividends paid are immediately reinvested in new shares.
The impact of short-term increases or decreases in share price on TSRs is reduced by averaging share price across the three months prior to the start and end of the performance period.
3 ROE performance is the same metric described as ROCE performance in the 2011 Directors Remuneration Report.
This is a change in nomenclature only: the definition of the metric has not changed from 2011 to 2012.
The definition of ROE in respect of the 2013 has been refined and is described on page 112.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 109 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2012 Consideration of wider employee pay When setting the policy for EDs remuneration, the Committee has regard to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere within the Group.
In particular, the Committee has sight of: Salary increases for the general employee population: Group-wide benefit offerings including pensions : Overall spend on annual bonus: and Participation levels in the annual bonus and LTIP.
The Company does not directly consult with employees when formulating ED pay policy.
However it does take into account information provided by the HR function and feedback from employee opinion surveys.
Remuneration scenarios The charts below illustrate how much the current EDs could earn under different performance scenarios assuming a constant share price : Threshold Threshold bonus of 25% of base salary and 20% vesting under the LTIP.
Plan Plan bonus of 75% of base salary and 50% vesting under the LTIP.
Stretch Stretch bonus of 150% of base salary and maximum vesting under the LTIP.
Scenarios for Patrick Regan and Trevor Matthews are the same as their base salaries are identical.
Trevor Matthews will step down from the Board prior to the 2013 AGM.
The above scenarios therefore applied to him for 2012, but will not apply for 2013.
Total remuneration earned in respect of 2012 The Committee recognises the need for transparency on the link between remuneration decisions and performance.
We have therefore set out below detail of pay earned by the current EDs in respect of performance to December 2012 and how payments under both the ABP and LTIP have been determined.
Table 4 below sets out the total remuneration earned by each current ED who served during 2012.

69.83% of the award is due to vest in March 2013.
An assumed Aviva ordinary share price of 373.00 pence has been used to determine the value of the award.
2 Pension contributions consist of employer contributions into the defined contribution section of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, excluding salary exchange contributions made by the employees, plus payments in lieu of pension above the lifetime or annual allowance caps.
3 Mark Wilson joined the board as an ED on 1 December 2012, and became Group CEO on 1 January 2013.
He received no emoluments in respect of 2012.
Further explanatory notes, and information on former EDs who served during 2012, are set out on page 110.

Solely taking into account Group business and on-plan personal measures would have resulted in a bonus of 78% of salary for EDs in respect of 2012 performance, although business unit performance would also be taken into account reflecting the remit of each ED.
The Committee has taken into account the underpin measures, namely Economic Value Added, Economic Capital, absolute and relative TSR, as described below, to ensure that any bonus payments are more closely aligned to shareholders experience.
Following careful consideration of these metrics by the Committee, it agreed that no ED would receive a bonus in respect of 2012.

Correspondingly 69.83% of the award is due to vest in March 2013.

Table 7: Result of the vote on Directors Remuneration Report at 2012 AGM For Against 2012 vote 45.59% 54.41% Aviva recognises that pay was not sufficiently linked to performance in 2011.
As set out in the Remuneration Committee chairmans letter, following consultation with our major institutional shareholders, a number of changes have been made: We introduced underpin metrics in respect of bonuses for 2012 and have committed to consider these underpin metrics for future years until any alternative arrangements are agreed following consultation to ensure annual bonus pay-outs are more closely aligned to the shareholder experience.
Taking into account performance against these measures, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to revise bonus outcomes where appropriate.
Such discretion, if applied, would only be used to reduce the outcome: Future buyouts will be made on a like-for-like basis in line with best market practice: and We have also reviewed and changed senior management contracts and the good leaver definition in our share plan rules.
Appointment of Group CEO Mark Wilson joined the Board on 1 December 2012 and took up the role of Group CEO on 1 January 2013.
As announced at the time of his appointment, his remuneration details are as follows: Base salary 980,000 per annum, subject to review in 2014: Annual bonus 75% of base salary for plan performance and 150% of base salary for stretch performance: LTIP he is eligible for an LTIP grant of up to 350% of base salary subject to meeting specific performance conditions over a three year performance period.
His 2013 grant will be at 300% of base salary: Relocation expenses he is eligible to claim reasonable and appropriate relocation expenses of up to 200,000 inclusive of any benefit-in-kind liability which may arise in respect of relocation from Hong Kong to the UK.
If any additional reasonable expenses above this limit are incurred in the course of Mr Wilsons relocation the Remuneration Committee has agreed to consider reimbursement of such additional expenses up to a further limit to be agreed: and Benefits a cash car allowance and PMI.
Base salaries As highlighted in the Remuneration Committee chairmans letter, EDs base salaries will not be increased in 2013.
Table 8: EDs base salaries 1 April 2012 salary 1 April 2013 salary Change from 2012 Patrick Regan 720,000 720,000 0% Trevor Matthews 720,000 720,000 0% Annual bonus As summarised in table 3, the maximum bonus opportunity for all EDs will remain unchanged for the 2013 financial year at 150% of base salary, with two-thirds of any bonus earned subject to compulsory deferral for three years.
Unvested awards are subject to clawback and risk of forfeiture during this period.
Annual performance is measured against a range of key financial, employee and customer performance indicators, which account for 70% of the maximum, and against personal objectives, which account for 30% of the maximum.
To align with the business priorities for 2013, the financial measures at Group level will be: net capital returns profit before tax: MCEV value of new business for the Life business : combined operating ratio for the General Insurance business : and total expenses.
Personal objectives will include common objectives for effective leadership and risk management.
As highlighted previously, bonus outcomes will also be subject to consideration of our performance against our underpin metrics Economic Value Added, Economic Capital and TSR.
LTIP As summarised in table 6, the LTIP vests subject to the degree of achievement of two equally weighted performance measures, absolute ROE and relative TSR performance, which have been chosen to reflect shareholders long-term interests.
For 2013, a grant of 225% of base salary will be made to Patrick Regan and 300% of base salary to Mark Wilson.
No grant will be made to Trevor Matthews who will cease to be a director prior to the 2013 AGM.
ROE targets ROE targets determine the vesting of 50% of any LTIP award and are set annually within the context of the Companys three-year business plan.
The 2012 LTIP award ROE targets are set out in table 9.
Table 9: 2012 LTIP ROE Targets 1 Achievement of ROE targets over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vest based on achievement of ROE targets Less than 30% 2011: less than 33% 0% 30% 2011: 33% 10% Between 30% and 37.5% 2011: Between 33% and 40.5% Pro rata between 10% and 50% on a straight line basis 37.5% and above 2011: 40.5% and above 50% Notes 1 The percentage of shares in award that vest based on achievement of ROE targets is the same in 2011 and 2012.
112 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2012 The definition of ROE was refined in early 2013.
ROE will now be calculated as IFRS profit after tax and non-controlling interest, excluding the impact of investment variances and economic assumption changes, over average IFRS equity excluding pension scheme net surplus deficit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company.
TSR targets Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of any LTIP award.
To ensure that Avivas performance is measured against appropriate comparators with similar business operations and geographic footprints, some minor changes were made to the TSR comparator group for 2013.
Companies focused on banking were excluded and some more relevant comparators within the insurance sector were added to ensure a robust group.

All employee share plans EDs are eligible to participate in a number of HMRC-approved all employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.
These plans included a free share element under the AESOP.
Under this element of the AESOP, eligible employees can receive up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum in shares based upon the profits of the Companys UK businesses.
The shares are free of tax subject to a retention period.
Free shares were awarded in 2012.
However, this element of the AESOP has since been discontinued and no awards will be made in 2013.
The partnership share element of the AESOP, which the Company also operates, allows participants to invest up to 125 per month out of their gross salary in the Companys shares.
There is currently no matching element to this investment by the Company.
However a matching element is due to be introduced in April 2013 through which the Company will match every purchased share with two matching shares for the first 40 of a participants monthly contribution.
For as long as the employee remains employed by the Company, matching shares will be subject to forfeiture if purchased shares are withdrawn from the AESOP within three years of purchase.
From May 2013 participants will also be eligible to receive Dividend Shares through the AESOP.
Shares awarded to, or investments made by, EDs through the AESOP are included in table 20 of this Report.
The Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme and Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2007 allow eligible employees to acquire options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.
In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a three, five, or seven year HMRC-approved savings contract, subject to a maximum savings limit of 250 per month.
In 2012, only three and five year contracts were offered.
Details of options granted to EDs under these schemes are included in table 19.
Share ownership requirements The Company has an internal shareholding requirement such that the Group CEO is required to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of base salary and each ED is required to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 150% of base salary.
The EDs, including the Group CEO, are required to retain 50% of the net shares released from deferred annual bonuses and LTIPs until the shareholding requirement is met.
There is no target date for meeting the share ownership requirement.
Unvested share awards including shares held in connection with compulsory bonus deferrals are not taken into account in applying this test.
Table 11 below shows the position at 31 December 2012, based on that days closing middle market price of an ordinary share of the Company of 373.00 pence.

3 Trevor Matthews will resign from the Board prior to the 2013 AGM.
External board appointments The Company recognises that its EDs can benefit from serving in a personal capacity as a non-executive director of non-Aviva Group companies.
At the same time, it is conscious of the corporate governance recommendations that EDs should take account of the time commitment required by a non-executive director NED position and ensure that any such role does not impact their ability to carry out fully their executive duties.
The Company therefore has a policy of normally allowing senior executives to serve as a NED of one external company, subject to approval by the Board, and for the individual to retain any board fees.
None of the EDs held external NED appointments during 2012.
Following the disposal of the Groups interests in Delta Lloyd N. V. in January 2013, Patrick Regan, who was until that time a Company-nominated member on the supervisory board of Delta Lloyd N. V. continued to be a member of the supervisory board in a personal capacity.
From that point he has therefore held an external NED appointment.
During the time he was a Company-nominated member on the supervisory board of Delta Lloyd N. V. he did not receive a board fee.
TSR rebased to 100 114 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2012 Non-executive directors The NEDs, including the chairman of the Company, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities.
The key terms of the appointments are set out in table 14 below.

Termination By the director or the Company at their discretion without compensation upon giving one months written notice for NEDs and three months written notice for the chairman of the Company.
Expenses Reimbursement of travel and other expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of their duties.
Time commitment Each director must be able to devote sufficient time to the role in order to discharge his or her responsibilities effectively and spend a minimum of 25 days a year on Company business.
NEDs spend an average of 41 days a year on Company business, with the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees spending substantially more.

It is the Companys policy to set the fees paid to the chairman of the Company and NEDs taking account of the median market payments in international companies of similar size and complexity.
NEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board duties.
A further fee is paid to NEDs in respect of membership and, where appropriate, chairmanship of Board committees.
Fees are reviewed annually and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience.
In determining the level of fees paid to the NEDs, the Board receives recommendations from the EDs, who consider the NEDs duties and responsibilities, together with the time commitment required in preparing for and attending meetings, and the amounts paid by competitors and similar-sized companies.
The Chairman of the Company and NEDs do not participate in any incentive or performance plans or pension arrangements and they also do not receive an expense allowance.
The Companys articles of association provide that the total aggregate remuneration paid to the Chairman of the Company and NEDs will be determined by the Board within the limits set by shareholders.
The current aggregate limit of 2 million was approved by shareholders at the Companys 2012 AGM.
EDs are remunerated under their employment contracts and receive no additional fee for serving as Board directors.
Following a review of the fees for holding the position of the senior independent director or a committee chairman or in respect of committee membership, the Board agreed to the fee changes shown in table 15 below.
These increases were effective from 1 April 2012.
The Board does not intend to increase the fees in 2013.
The total amount paid to NEDs in 2012 was 1.5 million.

The transfer value at 31 December 2011 previously provided for Igal Mayer included the value of the early retirement subsidies for which Mr Mayer did not qualify following his resignation during 2012.
5 No former directors received any increase in retirement benefits in excess of the amount to which they were entitled, on the later of the date when the benefits first became payable, or 31 March 1997.
6 The transfer value of net increase decrease in accrued pension shows the value of the increase decrease in accrued pension net of the inflation, over the year, net of contributions.
This is zero for UK based employees as there is no further accrual of benefits and accrued benefits are increased up to retirement in line with inflation.

Share options audited information Details of the EDs who were in office for any part of the 2012 financial year and hold or held options over ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the Companys share based incentive plans are set out in table 19 below.
Savings-related share options refer to options granted under the HMRC-approved Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2007.
Options are normally exercisable during the six-month period following the end of the relevant three, five and seven year savings contract.
Executive share options approved refer to options granted under the HMRC-approved schedule to the Aviva Executive Share Option Plan 2005.
Options will be exercisable on 30 March 2013 to the extent that the LTIP awards granted in 2010 have vested.
Any gain made on exercise of these options will be used to reduce the number of shares vesting under the LTIP.
Therefore, the vesting of the options will not increase the overall number of shares received by the EDs from their LTIP awards.
