In addition EVRAZ operations Sheregesh and Abakan and the grade of 16% at the SobstvennoKGOK holds a licence to develop the suspension of production at higher cost Kachkanarskoye iron ore deposit at EVRAZ contiguous  operations.

The licence for development of this r appointment of key contractors for the deposit is valid till 2026. construction of a new tailings dump and thickening facilities at EVRAZ KGOK In 2012, Evrazruda mined 11.0 million tonnes following a project optimisation process and of iron ore resulting in production of 4.4 million detailed feasibility study: tonnes of iron ore concentrate, all of which r integration of the Kachkanar Heat and was delivered to EVRAZ ZSMK.
As of 1 July Power Station into EVRAZ KGOKs 2011, total proven and probable iron ore operations and the completion of a reserves of Evrazruda under the JORC Code pre-feasibility study on its modernisation: were estimated at approximately 249 million r successful ramp-up of backfilling facilities tonnes grading 31.8% Fe.
at Evrazrudas Tashtagol mining operation allowing access to pockets of rich iron ore: In November-December 2012 the Irba mining r completion of a debottlenecking programme operation of Evrazruda was suspended due to at the Abagur beneficiation plant at unfavourable market conditions.
Evrazruda resulting in the elimination of losses at the beneficiation stage and a As a result of an impairment test in the new substantial growth in iron ore concentrate pricing environment, the Company has output during winter periods: recognised an impairment loss of US$356 r ongoing production ramp-up at the highly million related to the current operations of promising Sheregesh mining operation from Evrazruda as of 31 December 2012.
For more the current 1.9 million tonnes of iron ore per details please refer to note 6 of the Financial annum to 4.8 million tonnes per annum by Statements.
At the same time, the Company 2017.
The implementation of modern mining continues to evaluate options to increase the and iron ore transportation methods at efficiency of this operation and implement Sheregesh, which is part of Evrazruda, will development plans.
ensure a long-term cost of production of saleable iron ore concentrate at USD 70 per In 2012, EVRAZ VGOK mined 4.6 million tonne: and tonnes of iron ore resulting in production of r finalisation of a feasibility study on the 1.2 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate and modernisation of Evrazrudas Abakan mining 1.1 million tonnes of sinter.
EVRAZ VGOK operation to upgrade mining and iron ore supplies finished products to EVRAZs steel transportation methods with the aim of plants, primarily to EVRAZ ZSMK and EVRAZ achieving long-term production costs for NTMK and insignificant volumes to third saleable iron ore concentrate of USD 70 per parties.
As of 1 July 2011, total proven and probable iron ore reserves of EVRAZ VGOK under the JORC Code were estimated at approximately 110 million tonnes with an average grade of 27.8% Fe.
