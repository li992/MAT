Production, reserves and operations Mineral resources As required by the Australian Securities Exchange, the following tables contain details of other mineralisation that has a reasonable prospect of being economically extracted in the future but which is not yet classified as Proved or Probable Reserves.
This material is defined as Mineral Resources under the JORC Code.
Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors.
While in the judgment of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.
As in the case of reserves, managed operations estimates are completed using or testing against Rio Tinto long-term pricing and market forecasts scenarios.
Resources are stated as additional to the reserves reported earlier.
Where operations are not managed by Rio Tinto the resources are published as received from the managing company.
Where new project resources or reserves are footnoted as being reported for the first time, additional information about them can be viewed on the Rio Tinto website.
