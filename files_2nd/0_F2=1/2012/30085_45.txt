SIGMA SHARES Managers Report Sigma Share Class James Wilkinson MRICS Fund Manager Performance Over the year to 31 March 2012 the Sigma share NAV total return was -13.6%.
The benchmark total return was -12.1%.
This marks a significant improvement from the half year position but it is nevertheless disappointing to have to report a year of negative returns for shareholders.
As we described in the Market Background section, the year saw further turmoil in stock markets in general and very high levels of volatility.
In this period of heightened fear, smaller, less liquid companies suffered disproportionately and the Sigma share class underperformed the Ordinary share class by 5.1%.
This is the first time since Sigmas launch in July 2007 that smaller companies have underperformed larger ones.
Such an outcome prompts us to examine the strategies we employ to achieve the Sigma classs objective and the portfolio we have put in place as a result.
The Sigma classs objective is to maximise shareholders returns by investing in the shares of smaller real estate companies.
Our experience is that over time smaller real estate companies generate superior returns when compared to their larger peers.
We see a number of reasons for this.
Small companies tend to be focused businesses with a clear and easily defined strategy.
They are often led by entrepreneurial individuals or small teams with significant personal financial exposure to the businesses they run.
These leaders are able to make fast and effective decisions that are implemented without dilution by multiple management layers.
Small businesses can also be more easily fine-tuned to the economic climate than large ones.
Individual deals can make a significant difference to a small companys balance sheet and P&L.
