Tongon is an open pit mining operation which employs Tongon had a difficult year in 2012, producing 210 615 ounces, the four standard mining practices of drill, blast, load and substantially below its target.
The mine was plagued by a series haul.
Mining started in April 2010 and Tongon has planned of operational challenges, starting with underperformance in a ten year LOM.
It has two main pits, South Zone SZ and the mining of the pit as it struggled to manage the transition the smaller North Zone NZ, both of which have potential from softer oxide material to fresh rock.
This was compounded for more reserves.
Underground mineral resources are those insitu mineral resources below the NZ US$1 500 oz pit shell reported at a 2.0g t cut-off.
Mineral resources were generated by Mr Babacar Diouf and Mr Mamadou Ly, both officers of the company, and supervised by Mr Jonathan Kleynhans, an officer of the company and competent person.
Open pit mineral reserves are reported at a gold price of US$1 000 oz and 1.39g t cut-off and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Open pit mineral reserves were calculated by Mr Shaun Gillespie, an independent consultant and competent person.
