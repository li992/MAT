The company has continued to report positive results with EBITDA increasing on a constant currency basis by approximately 9% in 2012, driven by strong trading in Latin America as well as a recovery in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011.
However, some of the strong results were partially offset by drought and price pressures from generics in North America, a slow recovery from the 2011 oods in China and South Asia, and dry weather in India.
