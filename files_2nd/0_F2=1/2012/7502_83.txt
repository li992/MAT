Overview Business review Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements The Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and governance matters when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
As detailed later in this report, a customer satisfaction related element has been added to the bonus arrangements for 2012 13.
However, the Committee has chosen not to take any other matters into specific account in setting performance targets for 2012 13 in the belief that the structures in place neither encourage nor reward inappropriate behaviour and that relevant operational controls relating to such matters are in place.
The Committee is satisfied that neither the structure of the remuneration packages, with the high weighting on variable pay, nor the performance measures targeted under the annual bonus and LTIP, encourage inappropriate risk taking.
The remuneration arrangements are designed so as to provide a strong alignment of interest between the executives and shareholders and to support the growth and performance aspirations of the Company and the Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements meet these objectives.
Furthermore, a claw-back provision to annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards was introduced in 2011 which helps to further guard against excessive risk-taking.
