Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Changes in market interest rates may produce fair value adjustments to the financial instruments which we hold which in turn will impact on the reported profit.
Outlook The UK economy is again in recession, with only limited growth forecast for the remainder of 2012 and for 2013.
The risk of adverse impacts from the crisis in the Eurozone continues.
The picture is somewhat more positive in the USA where growth seems to have returned, albeit at a modest rate.
A return to sustained economic growth and prosperity in the UK and USA is essential if we are to see an upturn in business confidence, employment and the demand for accommodation which in due course will drive up rental and capital values.
We take a long term approach to the growth of our investment property portfolio and this will continue, notwithstanding the challenging business outlook which we face for the immediate future.
We remain confident that the Group is well placed for sustained progress, based upon the solid foundation of its diverse portfolio with its low gearing, managed, as ever, in the prudent yet entrepreneurial manner which has become our hallmark over the years.
Above: In challenging times we are more than ever dependent on the efforts of our dedicated and 3045 Grand hardworking staff: our thanks must go to them.
