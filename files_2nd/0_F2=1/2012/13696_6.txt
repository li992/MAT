Business Review 2012 Results Results PBTA was at the top end of market expectations at 60.1 million 2011: 50.8 million.
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 19.48 pence 2011: 16.68 pence.
The contribution of each segment grew significantly: Underlying Profit m 2012 2011 Energy 39.7 32.1 24% Built and Natural Environment 31.8 29.0 10% Total 71.6 61.1 17% as defined in note 1 g to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Energy activities are largely conducted on a worldwide basis.
In combination with our Built and Natural Environment business in Australia Asia Pacific, we now have over 70% of our underlying profit generated outside Europe.
During 2012 this generally exposed us to higher growth economies and good opportunities.
A significant proportion of our Built and Natural Environment activity relates to projects providing the infrastructure necessary to process and deliver energy and power resources.
Consequently, we estimate that approximately 70% of our underlying profit is now earned in the global Energy and associated infrastructure markets.
Cash Flow, Funding and Dividend The Group continued its excellent conversion of profit into cash.
Adjusted operating cash flow was 76.0 million 2011: 71.1 million.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with no defined benefit pension schemes or historic pension liabilities.
We have bank facilities of 125 million available until July 2016.
These comprise a 75 million committed facility, with an additional 50 million available as required.
The cost of these facilities remains at a low level.
Net bank borrowings at the year end were 13.5 million 2011: 23.5 million, after investing 24.2 million in acquisitions 2011: 27.2 million.
We remain well positioned to continue to fund the Groups growth strategy.
The Board continues to be confident about the Groups financial strength and is recommending a final dividend of 3.34 pence per share payable on 24 May 2013 to shareholders on the register on 12 April 2013.
If approved the total dividend for the full year would be 6.40 pence per share, an increase of 15% 2011: 5.56 pence per share.
Our dividend has risen at about this rate for 19 consecutive years.
It increased 75% over the 4 years of the global financial crisis, whilst our net debt has reduced substantially, to an 8 year low, after investing 120.6 million in acquisitions in the same period.
Markets and Trading Energy We provide internationally recognised consultancy services to the energy sector from bases in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and Asia.
These act as regional centres for projects undertaken in many other countries.
The 2012 results show the significant growth anticipated, with a strong margin: 2012 2011 Fee income ms 225.9 186.1 Underlying profit ms 39.7 32.1 Margin % 17.6 17.2 as defined in note 1 g to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
As anticipated, this business continued to make good progress in the final months of the year.
Our clients investment in conventional oil and gas exploration and production was generally strong throughout the year.
Our activity in the unconventionals market remained buoyant internationally, with a shift from shale gas to liquids in the USA.
We experienced an encouraging uplift in activity in most parts of the world and continued to see a particularly strong performance in the US.
This was based on both domestic and international projects, including good activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico.
Following last years political disturbances, our activity in North Africa was subdued throughout 2012, although opportunities elsewhere in Africa and parts of the Middle East continued to improve.
com 5 Our training and oceanographic businesses performed well and our reputation as independent advisors to the financial services market in respect of transactions and asset valuations continued to grow.
The acquisition of PEICE, announced on 16 January 2013, accelerates the development of our training business, particularly in Canada.
Good margins have been maintained.
With global E&P capital expenditure forecast to grow in 2013, it seems likely that the positive trends in this business will continue.
Built and Natural Environment BNE Within these businesses we provide a wide range of consultancy services to many aspects of the property and infrastructure development and management sectors.
These include: environmental assessment, the management of water resources, health and safety, risk management, town and country planning, building, landscape and urban design, surveying and transport planning.
Profit in the year improved, as did the margin: 2012 2011 Fee income ms 255.3 269.1 Underlying profit ms 31.8 29.0 Margin % 12.5 10.8 as defined in note 1 g to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
BNE: Europe 2012 2011 Fee income ms 157.2 178.2 Underlying profit ms 18.9 18.0 Margin % 12.0 10.1 as defined in note 1 g to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our BNE business in Europe increased its contribution compared with the same period last year, despite markets remaining uncertain.
In this business we provide support to our clients operations in the water, health and safety and risk management sectors, in order to enable them to comply with legislation and regulation.
We continued to see reasonable levels of activity in these markets, although a number of significant projects for UK water clients came to an end around the middle of the year.
Both our Irish and Dutch businesses also performed well despite being exposed directly to the economic uncertainty of the eurozone.
We concluded the sale of our Irish facilities management business in March.
This accounts for most of the year on year reduction in fee income.
Many of our traditional commercial development clients became more cautious about investing in new capital projects during the second half.
We have, therefore, been even more selective about the market sectors in which we invest and have, in particular, focussed on providing further support to those clients developing energy infrastructure, such as on and off shore windfarms, pipelines and interconnectors, power stations and waste to energy plants.
Investment potential is greater in this market: recent UK Government statements about energy production from gas were encouraging.
It currently seems that market conditions are unlikely to improve in 2013, so we continue to focus upon efficiency improvements to maintain our performance.
BNE: Australia Asia Pacific 2012 2011 Fee income ms 98.3 91.0 Underlying profit ms 13.0 11.0 Margin % 13.2 12.1 as defined in note 1 g to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our BNE business in Australia Asia Pacific produced significantly better results than in 2011.
In the first part of the year we continued to benefit from the high levels of investment in the activities and associated infrastructure necessary to deliver mining, coal seam gas and associated LNG projects, in Queensland and the conventional gas projects offshore Western Australia.
These provide the opportunity for us to deliver a wide range of services to clients.
