Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Total rental and related income increased in the year by 4.4 million 2011 2.8 million.
However, this was more than offset by an increase of 7.3 million 2011 4.8 million in property operating expenses, with rises in the costs of repairs and local authority charges as major contributory causes.
In addition to its negative impact on the annual property revaluation, the collapse of Southern Cross resulted in combined costs and loss of rental of 1.4 million in the year.
Residential occupancy rates in the UK have continued to improve.
In contrast, commercial vacancies have risen, reflecting continued difficult market conditions.
Overall, UK rental and related income increased by 2.6 million representing a rise of 3.4%.
During the year we sold a freehold development site in St Johns Wood at a price of 23.6 million yielding a surplus over book value of 11.0 million.
The site will be developed for very high value residential properties: this is a specialist activity and, in order to minimise risk, we decided to offer the site for sale to those with greater experience in the sector.
The proceeds will be used to reduce our recourse to external finance for our on-going commercial development activities.
The remainder of the profit on disposal of investment property relates to the sale of lease extensions.
The significant increase in net financing costs is substantially attributable to net fair value adjustments on financial instruments and other costs treated as interest, with actual interest payments remaining broadly constant year on year.
Dividend For many years it has been the Boards policy prudently to increase dividends in line with the Groups progress having regard to economic conditions.
Notwithstanding the uncertain immediate outlook, your Board has confidence in the ability of the Group to continue on its path of long term progress and therefore recommends an increase in the total dividend to 76p 2011 75p.
