OUTLOOK Investment in infrastructure and the involvement of the private sector in the delivery and financing of infrastructure projects remains important in many overseas markets.
Governments around the world are facing similar issues to those faced in the UK such as constraints on public sector capital, the need to re-invest in now outdated infrastructure, and the need to create economic growth and employment.
JLCM remains cautiously optimistic about the future of the UK infrastructure market.
The government has introduced PF2 as a route for procurement.
This development aims to coordinate alternative sources of financing with the provision of infrastructure to support the anticipated growth in the UK market.
JLCM welcomes this approach to stimulate the market and looks forward to engaging with participants in the near future on secondary opportunities.
