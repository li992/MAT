| Annual Report 2012 | 47 Zinc Copper Lead Global copper markets continued to be impacted by a combination of declining ore grades and delays in new projects which were expected to replace lost production from mines that are currently in decline.
It is expected that rising costs, on-going production disruptions, project delays and declining grades will remain a feature of the copper industry for the foreseeable future despite the material scheduled expansions in global mined production.
On the demand side, underlying Chinese copper consumption continued to increase although headline statistics remain subject to the inventory cycle.
2012 also saw the first tentative signs of life from the US housing market.
Zinc markets experienced another tough year with demand from Europe and US remaining weak through most of the year.
Chinese refined zinc metal imports increased during 2012, reaching some 600,000tonnes.
Looking forward, there are a number of major scheduled zinc mine closures in the next several years which can be expected to bring the market closer to balance.
This should in turn create an incentive price which better matches the need for sustained investment in new mines in the longer term.
Alumina Aluminium The average LME aluminium prices during 2012 were below the averages for 2011.
Although premium levels increased significantly compared to 2011, pressure on producers remains with many no longer able to cover their production costs.
Indications for aluminium premiums for duty unpaid, in-warehouse material at the beginning of 2012 were $100 to $125 per tonne, with an average 2012 range of approximately $140 to $165 per tonne and a more recent level of $200 to $230 per tonne.
Ferroalloys Nickel Cobalt Iron Ore Global stainless steel production increased by 3% in 2012, thanks largely to increased output in China.
However, macroeconomic uncertainty and subdued end user demand, especially during Q2 and Q32012, ensured that destocking activity continued throughout the distribution chain in most stainless steel markets.
By contrast, speciality steel markets catering for the oil, gas and aerospace industries continued to enjoy robust demand conditions.
Cobalt prices continued to decrease in 2012, losing 19% compared to 2011.
This trend was due to lower economic activity in Europe, a drop in Japanese metal demand and a Chinese destocking cycle, all of which contributed to an oversupply of cobalt metal during the year.
Iron ore prices were in the $135 to $150 range for the first four months of the year: however the Chinese crude steel industry then went through a difficult period during Q32012 and aggressively destocked.
Iron ore prices fell to a level of $86 per DMT in September 2012, the lowest in the past three years.
From this point, the market recovered quickly to reach $140 per DMT by the end of the year, fuelled by aggressive restocking and a pick-up in crude steel production.
MARKETINg Highlights Adjusted marketing EBITDA and EBIT for 2012 were $ 1,379 million and $ 1,363 million respectively, an increase of 11% and 10% compared to 2011.
2012 was characterised by lower prices across all base metals, however volumes and physical premia remained strong which enabled the generation of higher profits compared to 2011.

Zinc Copper Lead While zinc and lead volumes were relatively consistent between 2012 and 2011, copper volumes increased by 21%.
The increase was partly a timing difference, reflecting Chinese restocking with large shipments arriving Q12012 for material contracted in Q42011 when prices were considered low.
Alumina Aluminium In 2012, the marketed volumes for alumina aluminium remained at a strong level with a small increase to 11.5milliontonnes, from 11.4milliontonnes in 2011.
Ferroalloys Nickel Cobalt Iron Ore Overall nickel volumes were 21% higher than 2011.
For nickel metal, record production at Murrin Murrin and a full years production from Xstratas Falcondo ferronickel operation aided volumes.
Nickel ore almost doubled during 2012, attributable to Glencores continued growth in this particular market segment.
China destocking and a decrease of concentrate production in the DRC, impacted volumes of cobalt in intermediates during the year.
In iron ore, spot units offered by the majors have increased substantially enabling us to increase our overall tonnage by 9.5milliontonnes to 19.8milliontonnes.
INduSTRIAL ACTIVITIES Highlights Metals and minerals industrial activities performance was down in 2012, driven primarily by lower average metal prices, including nickel, aluminium impacting alumina, zinc and copper.
The production scorecard was mixed with some excellent performances including own sourced copper production up 37% at Mutanda and a record year of nickel production at Murrin Murrin.
Overall volume growth was however lower than expected, particularly due to lost production power disruption issues in the DRC, mainly impacting Katanga, temporary operational issues at Cobar and nationalisation of the Colquiri tin mine in Bolivia in June 2012.
Total industrial revenues for metals and minerals were $8,420million, down 3% from $8,667million in 2011.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT for 2012 were $1,625million and $708million, down 23% and 48% compared to $2,122million and $1,357million in 2011.
The higher EBIT % reduction reflects the largely fixed cost nature of depreciation and amortisation non-cash over a constant level of production.
Production is included on a 100% basis.
2 Lead metal includes lead contained in lead concentrates.
3 C opper metal includes copper contained in copper concentrates and blister copper.
4 Cobalt contained in concentrates and hydroxide.
5 Gold Silver conversion ratios of 1 53.54 and 1 44.53 for 2012 and 2011 respectively based on average prices.
| Annual Report 2012 | 51 OPERATIONAL HIgHLIgHTS Kazzinc Glencore interest: 69.6% 2012 gold production from own sources was 474,000 toz, an increase of 22% compared to 2011.
This higher production reflects the continued growth at Altyntau as well as the benefits from gold recovered from the copper smelter.
Silver production from own sources was 4.8milliontoz, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year, reflecting an increase in the level of own silver-bearing copper concentrates processed.
Total silver production also increased significantly during 2012 as a result of processing more high silver content concentrates from third parties.
Copper production from own sources in 2012 was 49,600tonnes, a reduction of 3% compared to 2011.
However, copper cathode production increased by 25,800tonnes to 47,300tonnes, following the ramp-up at Kazzincs new copper smelter which was commissioned in 2011.
2012 lead production from own sources was 26,800tonnes, a decrease of 25% compared to 2011.
This reflects the ramp-up at the new lead smelter which was commissioned in August 2012 and the processing of gold rich concentrates at the old lead smelter prior to its decommissioning.
Zinc production from own sources was 227,300tonnes, a decrease of 8%, resulting from the expected small reduction in grade during 2012.
Katanga Glencore interest: 75.2% Katanga produced 93,000tonnes of copper in metal and in concentrate from own sources during 2012, a 2% increase compared to 2011.
Cobalt production in 2012 was 2,100tonnes, a 12% decrease compared to 2011.
Production during the year was severely disrupted by the recurrent general power disruptions in the DRC which resulted in 67 days of lost production.
The new power converter part of the World Bank power project and new synchronous condenser under Katangas agreement with La Socit Naturale dElectricit SNEL, DRCs national power operator were commissioned in December 2012 and have subsequently resulted in a decrease in power disruption.
Further improvements in the reliability and availability of the electricity supply are expected in the medium term as a result of the joint Power Project announced in March 2012, see below currently underway and being undertaken by Katanga, Mutanda and Kansuki in partnership with SNEL.
Katanga produced its first copper cathode from the new solvent extraction plants and converted electro-winning facility during December 2012 as part of the Phase 4 project.
The completion of this project will enable Katanga to increase total processing capacity and upgrade the quality of copper produced through the application of modern technologies.
The Phase 4 project remains on target for mechanical completion in Q32013.

com Mutanda Glencore interest: 60.0% In 2012, Mutanda produced 87,000tonnes of copper in metal and concentrate from own sources, a 37% increase compared to 2011.
2012 copper cathodes production increased 90% to 83,500tonnes.
2012 cobalt production was 8,500tonnes, an 8% increase from 2011.
Mutanda continues to increase cobalt production through the use of SO from its sulphuric acid and SO plant.
A new power generation plant, dedicated to providing reliable power to the acid 2 2 and SO plant, was commissioned in December 2012.
Following completion of the cobalt circuit in Q42012, Mutanda has installed 2 cobalt in hydroxide capacity of 23,000tonnes per annum.
The feasibility study for the construction of a 100,000tonnes of copper contained sulphide concentrator remains on track to be completed in Q12013.
In May 2012, Glencore acquired an additional 20% of Mutanda for a cash consideration of $420million plus acquired shareholder debts of approximately $60million.
Glencore also has the right, subject to the terms of a put and call option agreement exercisable in December 2013, to acquire a further 20% in Mutanda for a cash consideration of $430million.
As previously announced, the above transaction was the first step to achieve the merger of Mutanda and Kansuki, which is expected to form a combined entity having an installed capacity of 200,000tonnes per annum of copper by the end of 2013.
It is anticipated that the merger will be completed during H12013.
52 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN Kansuki Glencore interest: 37.5% Glencore holds a 50% interest in Kansuki Investments Sprl which in turn holds a 75% interest in the owner of the Kansuki concession, thereby giving Glencore an effective interest of 37.5%.
Kansuki is a 185 square kilometre copper and cobalt pre-development project which borders the Mutanda concession.
A total of $507million of capital expenditure for mine and plant development has been committed to, of which $413million had been spent as at 31December 2012.
Exploration of the Kansuki concession is on-going.
Katanga, Mutanda and Kansuki Power Project Mutanda, Katanga and Kansuki are collectively undertaking a project to secure power for all three operations via the refurbishment of two turbines at the Inga dam.
This project is expected to provide 450 megawatts of power by the end of 2015 the Power Project.
The project has started and is being executed in partnership with SNEL and EGMF, the project contractor.
The estimated cost of $284million will be paid by Mutanda, Katanga and Kansuki.
This investment will be recovered via lower future energy tariffs.
Mopani Glencore interest: 73.1% Mopani produced 99,000tonnes of own copper in 2012 and 187,100tonnes of total copper including third party sourced and toll material, reflecting a 2% and 8% decline respectively compared to 2011.
The reduction in total finished copper production primarily resulted from the planned biennial smelter shutdown.
The small reduction in Mopanis own copper production was due to the temporary suspension of the heap leach process earlier in the year.
The $323million Synclinorium shaft project to increase mine production, which is expected to come online during 2015, and the associated project to improve and modernise the smelter remain on track.
In 2012, Mopani announced that the smelter upgrade project including improving SO emission capture to above 97% is expected to be completed by December 2013, 18 months 2 ahead of the schedule initially agreed with the Zambian authorities.
Other Zinc Los Quenuales, Sinchi Wayra, AR Zinc, Portovesme, Rosh Pinah The acquisition of Rosh Pinah from 1June 2012 and a strong performance by AR Zinc resulted in higher production of silver metal and lead concentrates in 2012.
This was offset by lower production at Los Quenuales and Sinchi Wayra, as a result of the planned shift towards lower grade ore bodies, union issues at Los Quenuales and the nationalisation of the Colquiri mine at Sinchi Wayra.
The nationalisation of the Colquiri mine resulted in no tin being produced post June 2012.
Los Quenuales recently received community approval to develop a new ore area at Iscaycruz Santa Este, which has estimated ore resources of five to seven million tonnes.
The mine is expected to be operational in Q42013 and will reach an annual production of 20,000tonnes of zinc contained in concentrates in 2014.
Other Copper Cobar, Pasar, Punitaqui, Sable Metal production in 2012 was 40% lower than in 2011, due to a fire at Pasar that stopped production for approximately six months.
Since the restart in July 2012, production has been in line or above levels achieved during 2011.
2012 copper concentrate and silver contained in concentrate production were lower than 2011 levels by 13% and 9% respectively, primarily due to temporary operational issues at Cobar resulting from electrical failures and delays in underground development activities.
Completion of the new mine shaft at Cobar has been delayed due to poor ground conditions and is now expected in 2015.
Alumina Aluminium Sherwin Alumina Glencore interest: 100% 2012 production was 1.4million tonnes, a 6% reduction compared to 2011.
This reduction primarily relates to the overhaul of the calciner which was completed in Q12012.
Production since then has been as expected.
Ferroalloys Nickel Cobalt Glencore Manganese Glencore interest: 100% Glencore acquired 100% of Vales European manganese ferroalloys operations on 1November 2012.
The operations, located in Dunkirk, France and Mo I Rana, Norway, currently have the capacity to produce 150,000tonnes and 110,000tonnes of manganese ferroalloys per annum respectively.
Murrin Murrin Glencore interest: 100% Own sourced production in 2012 was 33,400tonnes of nickel and 2,400tonnes of cobalt, an increase of 17% and 18% respectively compared to 2011, reflecting a record year of production for Murrin Murrin based on best ever throughput levels and plant availability.
Murrin Murrin has also successfully contained costs as part of its on-going Margin Improvement Plan in response to the lower nickel price and high Australian dollar environment with further cost savings targeted in 2013.
