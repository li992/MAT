ORDINARY SHARES Managers Report Ordinary Share Class Marcus Phayre-Mudge MRICS Fund Manager Performance The Ordinary share class total return at -8.5% was slightly ahead of the benchmark total return of -8.9%.

Performance of pan European real estate shares over the twelve months to March have been, figuratively speaking, on a rollercoaster.
Strong performance in the first quarter, followed by the dramatic sell-off in the summer which deepened into a malaise in the autumn and then an abrupt U-turn in mid December as markets responded to both the ECBs largest ever LTROs as well as the change of political leadership in both Greece and Italy.
NAV growth in the fourth quarter was 12%, 220bps ahead of the benchmark as investors bought back into European equities across the board.
