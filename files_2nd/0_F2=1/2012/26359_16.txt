Asset Finance our uK and international Asset Finance and on-line deposit businesses.
international our non-core businesses in ireland, Europe, Asia and the rest of the world excluding businesses transferred to the commercial Banking division in the year.
Wealth provides strong growth opportunities for the Group.
its goal is to be recognised as the Wealth advisor of choice to appropriate Retail and commercial Banking customers alongside targeted customer acquisition.
We aim to grow the amount of customer deposits and funds under management that we manage on behalf of franchise customers, whilst improving margins and operating efficiency.
in Asset Finance, we have been refocusing the business into sectors which fit our risk appetite and profitability and are looking to deliver focused, profitable growth while completing the run-down or disposal of portfolios which are closed to new business.
in the international businesses, the priority is to maximise value in the medium-term.
The immediate focus is on close management of the balance sheet where we are contributing to a strengthening of the Groups balance sheet through a significant and managed run-down of non-core assets.
At the same time, we continue progress on rationalising our international footprint delivering operational efficiencies and reducing the cost base to fit the reshaped business models.
Progress against strategic initiatives The significant progress we have made in strengthening the balance sheet positions us for focused, profitable growth in our core business.
Alongside this we will continue to grow total customer balances including deposits and funds under management in the Wealth businesses where over time we expect customer appetite to shift from deposits to investment products.
We continue to focus on simplifying operations and processes, delayering management structures, consolidating supplier relationships and increasing the efficiency of distribution channels.
We are in the process of reshaping the business, realising additional efficiencies and cost savings through initiatives to consolidate the Wealth businesses and create a shared support infrastructure, develop a single customer platform and to automate core systems and processes for efficiency and improved customer experience in both Wealth and Asset Finance.
The division has also made good progress towards reducing its international presence with a further five exits announced in the year bringing the total to twelve, representing over a one third reduction in our international presence over the last two years.
We are investing in our Wealth business to grow market share in what is viewed as a key growth opportunity for the Group.
The investment is geared towards developing compelling propositions for mass affluent and affluent customers within the uK and channel islands and also those with uK connections in anglophile territories.
during 2012, we created one single Wealth business with the aim of generating synergies across the international and uK businesses.
We are focused on ways to leverage the strength of our core banking franchise which holds a number of significant customers who are wealth eligible.
investment has already been made in customer experience and plans are underway for significant technology and product development.
during 2012 there have been approximately 115,000 referrals into the Wealth business from other areas of the Group.
We remain confident that by delivering our strategy to be a simple, customer-focused uK and international business we can increase the trust of both customers and stakeholders.
in Wealth this has resulted in an improvement of client service accessibility.
This is demonstrated by the faster access to advice and support that customers are now receiving as a result of a new Private Banking client centre.
The new centre is making the referral process from Retail to our Wealth business simpler and swifter, and will be fully rolled out across the lloyds TsB and the Halifax networks by the end of 2013. in Asset Finance we have strong market positions in the uK and Australia and a strong funding base through our online deposit business.
We have refocused the businesses and have made substantial progress in exiting portfolios which do not fit our risk appetite while positioning the motor leasing and finance businesses for growth.
in the uK, lex Autolease delivered strong new business performance with a year on year increase in deliveries of 11 per cent.
lex Autolease is a market leader in the uK and already in the top five car leasing firms in Europe, with a strong customer proposition and deep insights and capabilities in the contract hire market.
The Blackhorse Motor Finance business grew new business by 11 per cent reflecting its return to a growth strategy.
The business has a strong established market position and a broad customer franchise.
Our focus is on further upgrading our market leading technology platform and using it to launch new customer propositions.
in line with our strategy to grow the motor and direct business, the Australian asset finance business achieved new business growth of 16 per cent in 2012.
The business also began a strategic investment to automate and simplify end to end systems with the objective of delivering an improved, cost effective customer experience.
We have further reduced non-core loans by 7.0 billion in 2012 through a mixture of repayments and selected asset disposals.
This includes the impact of a 2.6 billion gross asset reduction in ireland in respect of a successful disposal of a portfolio of wholesale assets.
Within Asset Finance, the non-strategic portfolio in run-off now represents only 10 per cent of the total business.

core underlying profit increased by 27 per cent to 459 million, largely driven by the strong performance in our Wealth and Asset Finance motor and contract hire businesses where core underlying profit increased by 25 and 13 per cent, respectively, together with improved profitability in our on-line deposit businesses.
core income was flat mainly as a result of lower income from funds under management as investment markets in 2012 remained subdued.
core costs reduced by 5 per cent to 1,795 million reflecting the progress we have made in simplifying and consolidating our Wealth business as part of the simplification programme.
This enabled us to make significant investment within the Wealth business in the year.
underlying non-core loss reduced by 56 per cent to 1,388 million driven by a continued reduction in impairments in ireland.
net interest income decreased by 20 per cent.
core net interest income grew by 6 per cent due to strong deposit inflows within the Wealth and on-line deposit businesses.
non-core net interest income reduced by 31 per cent driven by a 20 per cent fall in non-core assets, higher funding costs and the increased level of impaired assets in ireland.
net interest margin fell to 1.65 per cent from 1.72 per cent in 2011 despite margins in our core business increasing to 5.90 per cent in 2012, up from 5.04 per cent in 2011.
The year on year reduction in divisional margin was driven by our non-core business where margins fell from 1.35 per cent in 2011 to 1.13 per cent in 2012 as a result of significant non-core asset run-off in the year together with increased levels of impaired assets, mainly in ireland.
Other income decreased by 8 per cent.
core other income decreased by 1 per cent with modest growth in Wealth against a background of subdued investment markets and customer appetite off-set by reduced non-core income in Asset Finance and international driven by business sales in the year and continued non-core asset run-off.
Total costs decreased by 5 per cent despite a 4 per cent increase in total customer balances and funds under management.
This reflected our continued focus on simplifying our business model and reducing our international footprint.
The impairment charge reduced by 59 per cent to 1,480 million, largely as a result of lower charges in the irish business where the charge amounted to 1,245 million 2011: 3,187 million.
The rate of increase in newly impaired loans in ireland has slowed through 2012 from 4.1 billion to 1.6 billion.
customer deposits increased by 4.6 billion or 18 per cent to 30.8 billion reflecting continued growth in our core Wealth businesses whilst funds under management grew by 4 per cent reflecting a shift of customer appetite away from investment products towards deposits.
underlying profit increased by 25 per cent to 358 million driven by increased income, reflecting strong deposit and margin growth and lower costs, driven by cost saving initiatives across the business.
in Asset Finance, underlying profit increased by 10 per cent, despite an 8 per cent reduction in loans and operating lease assets as we completed the refocusing of the business to fit our risk appetite.
This resulted in improving margins in our motor finance and lending business, together with a 46 per cent growth in on-line deposits.
in international, underlying loss reduced by 1,754 million to 1,623 million largely driven by ireland where there was a decrease in the impairment charge from 3,187 million in 2011 to 1,245 million in 2012.

inflows have increased in the year primarily in st Jamess Place.
However this was largely offset by a reduced level of inflows in sWiP, where we have also seen an increase in the level of outflows in the year, in part reflecting a lack of consumer confidence in investment products across the industry.
Outflows in sWiP also consist of attrition within the insurance funds and strategic asset allocation decisions.
