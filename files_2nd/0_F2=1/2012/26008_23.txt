Accounting policies are contained within relevant notes and highlighted in blue, with the basis of preparation and general policies collected in Section 5.
Net revenue The Groups primary source of revenue is management fees.
Management fees are based on an agreed percentage of the assets under management.
Performance fees are earned from some funds when agreed performance conditions are met.
Other revenue items include initial charges, which are based on a set percentage of inows to our funds, and commissions earned on box profits and private client dealing charges.
Net revenue is stated after fee and commission expenses to intermediaries for ongoing services under distribution agreements.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of investment management services.
Revenue is shown net of any value added tax, rebates and discounts.
Revenue primarily consists of the following: management fees are recognised in the period in which the service is performed and calculated as a percentage of net fund assets managed in accordance with individual management agreements: initial charges and commissions on sales of unit trusts are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period of the provision of investment management services.
Initial charges also include income from the sale of units and profits earned on dealing within the unit trust managers box, calculated as the difference between the cost of purchasing redeemed units at cancellation prices and reselling them at creation prices.
Such box profits are recognised when the related transaction occurs: and performance fees, calculated as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund above a dened hurdle.
These are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will be receivable.
Such fees are normally recognised at the end of the relevant reporting period of the fund.
Fee and commission expenses These are paid to third parties for ongoing services under distribution agreements and are charged to the income statement over the period in which the service is expected to be provided.
The services provided include the provision of access to a basket of fund products, information on financial products, promotional materials, ongoing services to customers and transaction processing.

Segmental reporting The Group offers a range of products and services through different distribution channels.
All financial, business and strategic decisions are made centrally by the Board of Directors the Board, which determines the key performance indicators of the Group.
Information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, the Board, on a single segment basis.
While the Group has the ability to analyse its underlying information in different ways, this information is not used by the Board to make decisions on an aggregated basis.
The information used to allocate resources and assess performance is reviewed for the Group as a whole.
On this basis, the Group considers itself to be a singlesegment investment management business.
Management monitors operating earnings, a non-GAAP measure, for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.

Administrative expenses The largest administrative expense is staff costs.
The other operating expenses category includes certain significant costs such as administration fees, marketing and IT costs.
Operating leases Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benets of ownership of the asset.
All of the Groups leases are operating leases and rental payments are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Administrative expenses consists of the following items: 2012 2011 m m Staff costs Note 1.4 86.9 85.1 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment Note 3.3 0.8 0.6 Auditors remuneration see below 0.7 0.8 Operating lease rentals for land and buildings 2.0 1.9 Other operating expenses 38.0 35.4 Total administrative expenses 128.4 123.8 2012 2011 Auditors remuneration m m Fees payable to the Companys auditors and their associates for the audit of the Companys consolidated annual accounts 0.1 0.1 Fees payable to the Companys auditors and their associates for other services to the Group: Audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 0.3 0.3 Audit related assurance services 0.1 0.1 Tax advisory services 0.1 0.1 Other non-audit services 0.1 0.2 Total auditors remuneration 0.7 0.8 1.4.
Staff costs Staff costs include wages and salaries, share-based payments and pension costs and are recognised on an accruals basis as services are provided to the Company.
Pension costs The Group contributes to a number of dened contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Contributions in respect of the UK employees at the rate of 15 per cent.
of gross salary are made into the Jupiter Pension Scheme whose financial statements are available from the trustees at the registered ofce of the Company.
No liability is included in the balance sheet as no obligations were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Contributions made by the Group are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.

Share-based payments The Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from certain employees by granting the right to acquire either shares or options over shares, subject to certain vesting conditions.
These have been accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.
The difference between the fair value of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted and the price payable is recognised as an expense over the appropriate performance and vesting period.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of services is calculated using the market value on the date of award, discounted for dividends foregone over the holding period of the award, and is adjusted for expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the number of eligible employees leaving the Group and the number of employees satisfying the relevant performance conditions.
These estimates are reviewed regularly and the charge to the income statement is adjusted appropriately.
As a minimum, this is adjusted at the end of the relevant scheme.
Shares and options vest on the occurrence of a specified event under the rules of the relevant plan.
The fair value of shares and options granted during the year to be charged over the vesting period was 15.8m 2011: 13.6m.
A summary of the charge taken to the income statement excluding social security for each share-based payment arrangement is shown below: 2012 2011 m m Interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan 5.3 8.2 Deferred Bonus Plan 4.6 3.1 Long-term Incentive Plan 3.5 1.1 Sharesave Plan 0.3 0.3 Total Note 1.4 13.7 12.7 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 65 Section 1: Results for the year Notes to the Group financial statements Income statement continued 1.5.
Share-based payments continued The fair value of the services received has been calculated indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, as the Group has rebutted the presumption that the fair value of services can be estimated reliably.
Fair value amounts for the options granted under the DBP, LTIP and SAYE schemes were determined using a Black Scholes option-pricing method and the following assumptions: 2012 2011 DBP 2011 LTIP 2012 SAYE 2012 DBP 2010 LTIP 2011 SAYE 2011 Weighted average share price 2.47 2.43 2.52 2.91 2.58 2.06 Exercise price 0.02 1.97 0.02 1.69 Weighted average expected volatility % 35.0 34.4 33.3 48.3 43.8 45.7 Weighted average option life years 3.1 4.3 3.4 3.3 4.7 3.9 Weighted average dividend yield % 3.2 3.2 3.1 2.3 2.8 3.5 Weighted average risk-free interest rate % 0.6 0.8 0.4 1.8 2.2 1.2 Expected volatility for options granted in 2012 has been calculated using the historical volatility of the Group.
Expected volatility for options granted in 2011 were calculated using the historical volatility of a comparator group of companies.
Where relevant, assumptions have also been made for the proportion of options not vesting due to performance and service conditions not being met.
The numbers above in relation to the LTIP 2012 include the Joiner Plan as both schemes have a similar structure.
i Interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan These options were granted to certain employees prior to Listing in June 2010 and allow them to acquire shares at nominal value, subject to satisfying certain vesting and performance conditions.
The terms of the options allow individuals to make a payment to the Company entitling them to take up rights to shares between one and five years after the grant date, depending on the individual award.
The interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan were granted at the nominal price of 0.02, which gives them the characteristics of nil cost options, and therefore, the fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the award.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movement in, share options during the year: 2012 2011 WAEP WAEP Options outstanding Number Number At 1 January 15,460,528 0.02 16,883,100 0.02 Exercised 594,578 0.02 1,392,572 0.02 Forfeited 67,334 0.02 30,000 0.02 At 31 December 14,798,616 0.02 15,460,528 0.02 Exercisable at 31 December 2,015,705 641,067 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of these options was 2.18 2011: 2.40 per ordinary share.
No options were granted under this plan in 2012 or 2011.
For the options granted in 2010, the weighted average fair value of options granted was 1.50.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2012 is 1.2 years 31 December 2011: 1.8 years.

Share-based payments continued ii Deferred Bonus Plan DBP All employees of the Group who are eligible for a bonus over a certain level, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are required to participate in the DBP which provides for compulsory deferral of a proportion of bonus into either options over the Companys shares or units in the Groups funds.
The awards in respect of this plan are granted after the year end to which they relate.
The first year of this award was related to 2010 performance, with the first options granted in April 2011.
The awards made in 2012 in relation to 2011 performance were granted in the form of nil cost options over the Companys shares, at a price calculated as the market price immediately prior to the date of the award.
Awards will also be made in 2013 in relation to 2012 performance, thus a charge for these awards has been taken to the income statement in 2012.

Share-based payments continued iv Sharesave Plan All eligible UK employees may participate in the Groups Sharesave Plan, which was introduced in 2010.
Under the terms of this plan, employees may enter into contracts to save up to 250 per month and, at the expiry of a xed three or five year term, have the option to use these savings to acquire shares in the Company at a discounted price, calculated under the rules of the plan currently a 20 per cent.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of the share options outstanding under this plan at 31 December 2012 was 2.1 years 31 December 2011: 3.0 years.
Operating earnings Operating earnings are dened as net revenue less administrative expenses and do not include investment income and returns, other gains losses, amortisation of intangible assets or exceptional costs income.
These are items which the Group considers are not indicative of the ongoing income and costs of its operations.
The Group believes that operating earnings, while not a GAAP measure, gives relevant information on the profitability of the Group and its ongoing operations.
Operating earnings may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Exceptional income Exceptional items consist of those significant income and expenses which are required to be separately disclosed due to their size or incidence in order to enable a better understanding of the Groups financial performance.
"During 2010, a charge of 5.2m was recognised in relation to the contribution made to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme ""FSCS"" second interim levy for 2010 11."
In 2012, 5.0m of this levy was refunded and recognised as exceptional income.
There was no income arising in 2011 which the Group considers to be exceptional.
Finance income The Group earns income as a result of holding cash in bank deposits.
It also receives distributions from seed capital investments.
Interest on cash and cash equivalents is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend income from investments is recognised on the date when shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.

Finance expense The majority of the finance expense relates to interest on the bank loan.
Interest payable is charged on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Debt issue costs relating to the raising of loans and borrowings are deducted from the carrying value of the loans and borrowings and are amortised over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.
Finance costs, reported within finance expense, include ancillary charges for commitment fees, non-utilisation fees and margin reduction fees that are charged as incurred.
2012 2011 m m Interest payable on bank borrowings 5.6 9.5 Amortisation of debt issue costs Note 3.8 0.9 2.5 Fair value movement on interest rate swaps 0.3 1.6 Interest payable on interest rate swaps 0.4 0.4 Other finance costs 0.2 0.3 7.4 14.3 During the year, 65.0m 2011: 140.0m of the senior debt was repaid.
This resulted in an acceleration of 0.5m 2011: 1.6m in the amortisation of the debt issue costs.
Interest rate swaps In November 2010, the Group entered into two interest rate swaps, both with a notional value of 35.0m with interest settling quarterly.
One is for a period of three years paying a xed interest rate of 1.33 per cent.
the other is for a period of four years paying a xed interest rate of 1.6175 per cent.
Income tax expense The Groups headquarters are based in the UK.
It pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries in which it operates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current taxation, but there is also a charge relating to tax payable for future periods due to income or expenses being recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes deferred tax.
Deferred tax is charged to equity when the deferred tax benefit exceeds the cumulative income statement expense on share plans.
The Group provides for current tax according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the financial position date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is considered recoverable and, therefore, recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 69 Section 1: Results for the year Notes to the Group financial statements Income statement continued 1.10.
Income tax expense continued Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Current and deferred tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax that has arisen in respect of equity items is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, less the weighted average number of own shares held.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during that year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
For the purposes of calculating EPS, the share capital of the parent is calculated as the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue over the years reported.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares during the year used for the purposes of calculating EPS is as follows: 2012 2011 Number Number Weighted average number of shares m m Issued share capital 457.7 457.7 Less own shares held 80.0 129.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 377.7 328.6 Add back weighted average number of dilutive shares 18.1 13.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 395.8 341.8 The weighted average number of own shares is deducted from the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Own shares are shares held in an Employee benefit Trust EBT for the benefit of employees under the vesting, lock-in and other incentive arrangements in place.
