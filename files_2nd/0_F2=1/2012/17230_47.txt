Dilution and share usage Awards under the Groups share option scheme under which no options remain outstanding and the SAYE scheme are satisfied by the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were approved.
These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers guidelines restricting dilution from employee share plans.
The overall limits under the guidelines are that no more than 10% of a Groups issued share capital may be used in any ten year period.
Within the 10% limit, up to 5% may be used for discretionary share plans.
As at 29 January 2012, the Groups share usage against these limits was 5.2% and 1.18%, respectively.
It is currently intended that awards made under the LTIP will be satisfied by market purchased shares which are held in an Employee Benefit Trust.
Market purchase shares will also be used to satisfy awards made under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan and restricted share plans.
