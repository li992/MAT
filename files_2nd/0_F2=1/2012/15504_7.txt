DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION Each of the directors has confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware, and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information.
GOING CONCERN The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business Review on pages 11 to 20.
The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 21 to 24 and note 18 to the financial statements.
In addition, notes 14 and 18 include the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
From 1 September 2011, under the revised arrangements agreed with npower on 24 May 2011, the Company was no longer required to procure a letter of credit facility for npower as security against the cost of the energy it was supplying.
Also from this date, npower assumed responsibility for funding the seasonal variations in working capital associated with providing gas and or electricity to those customers who choose to pay for their energy using a budget plan.
The Groups credit requirements are therefore more constant over the annual operating cycle and accordingly the Group has secured from Barclays Bank PLC total credit facilities of 20 million for the period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 to meet both expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small business customer base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the uncertain economic outlook.
On this basis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The annual financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the FRCs Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued in October 2009.
