Our Assets Malomir Shifting towards a new stage in its development Malomir is an open-pit gold mine in the Key facts Progress against 2012 north-west part of the Amur region, the Groups first in this area.
strategic priorities Deposit type Explore Malomir was acquired by the Group in 2003 Hard-rock.
Contains both refractory significant exploration results received from as a greeneld site.
In the same year, the Group and non-refractory mineralisation browneld exploration at Quartzitovoye confirmed the existence of 161,000oz of P 1 Russian Category resources.
Today, thanks Mining Develop to the strength of the Groups in-house Open-pit, two pits currently active Continued development of the otation exploration team, the mine has 9.73Moz of plant ahead of commissioning Processing JORC-compliant Mineral Resources and On-site RIP plant, processing 180Ktpm Operate 4.04Moz Ore Reserves.
Exploration of the mine Gold production of 103,300oz, a 17% is still on-going and yielding promising results.
Licence acquired increase on 2011 2003 as a greeneld project: developed During the earlier years of Malomirs in-house Sustainability development, in-house exploration also Achieved ISO 14001 accreditation Commercial start up established the existence of two additional, 2010, plant expanded in 2011 and 2012: previously unknown, major deposits within otation plant to be commissioned in the licence area: one high-grade oxide deposit, 2013 Strategic priorities Q3 2013 Quartzitovoye, and an additional refractory for Malomir deposit, Ozhidaemoye the other refractory JORC Reserves and Resources deposit being the Malomir deposit itself.
Commissioning of the otation plant in 9.73Moz Mineral Resources: 4.04Moz This led the Group to decide on a two-stage Q3 2013 Ore Reserves development for the Malomir project: Mining and stockpiling of refractory ore the first stage being the processing of the from Malomir Central pit Contribution to the Groups non-refractory oxide material in an on-site 2012 gold production RIP plant, the second being the processing Continuation of exploration programme of the refractory material in an on-site otation at areas adjacent to Quartzitovoye plant, with the resultant otation concentrate being transported to Pokrovskiy for Location processing in the POX Hub.
Stage 1 of Malomirs development is now drawing to an Malomir is situated in the north-eastern c. 15% end and the mine is shifting to the processing 103,300oz part of the Amur region.
An all-weather of the refractory ores.
road links the mine to Pokrovskiy, which lies approximately 670km away.
Performance in 2012 Malomir produced 103,300oz of gold in 2012.
This was an increase of 17% on the amount produced in 2011 88,500oz despite lower recoveries due to the treatment of the Gold mine transitional ore.
This was achieved due City or town to expansion of the sorption circuit carried Railway out at the plant in Q1 2012.

This strategy has proved fruitful this year, when we identied a significant amount of easy-to-process oxide Resources at the site, with possible significant impact on future production.
But most exciting is the work we are doing on the POX otation plant, which is very quickly rising before our eyes.
Sergey Ermolenko CEO Malomir mining operations During 2012, construction continued on the mines 4Mtpa otation plant, Year ended Year ended Units 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 which is currently scheduled to be commissioned in Q3 2013.
As Malomir Total material moved m 000 16,042 9,094 refractory ore bodies are shallow and of Ore mined t 000 3,438 1,981 a bulk nature, they will be mined with a low Average grade g t 1.7 2.4 strip ratio.

Malomir processing operations Year ended Year ended Since the beginning of 2013, the Malomir Units 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 plant worked at throughputs of more Resin-in-Pulp RIP Plant than 200Ktpm due to the softness of ore.

to mine high-grade, oxide Ore Reserves from in Q3 2013. the Quartzitovoye open-pit, which are suitable The majority of ore processed in 2012 came for processing in the RIP plant, with higher The Group is intending to continue from the non-refractory Quartzitovoye ore recovery rates.
This required the removal of exploration at, and around, the Malomir mine, body with some additions from the oxidised large volumes of waste.
The resulting high including the newly-acquired licence area, and transitional upper levels of the refractory stripping coefcient, together with the lower which may result in a discovery of further ore body in the Central pit.
Malomir has recoveries from the transitional ore, non-refractory Reserves.
relatively small Reserves of the transitional adversely affected cash costs.

For the majority of the year, programme identied c. 240,000oz of non-refractory Reserves.
Malomir was mining and processing large additional oxide Resources in an ore body quantities of such transitional ore, which parallel to the Quartzitovoye pit internal resulted in a lower recovery rate compared preliminary estimate allowing the processing to 2011. of non-refractory ore to continue at the mine throughout 2013 and Q1 2014.
Work is The expansion of the sorption desorption currently being undertaken to outline new circuit in February 2012, which increased Reserves for inclusion in the 2013 mine plan.
