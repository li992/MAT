HM Revenue & Customs approval of the Companys status as an investment trust has been received in respect of the year ended 30April 2011 subject to matters that may arise from any subsequent enquiry into the Companys tax return.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Company has and will continue to conduct its affairs so as to continue as an investment trust.
With effect from 1 January 2012 the conditions and process for approval as an investment trust have been simplied.
The Directors do not consider that the changes will have any impact on the Companys status as an investment trust.
Application for investment trust status under the new process will be made.
The Company has one subsidiary, PCT Finance Limited a wholly owned dealing company whose results are consolidated with those of the Company.
The Companys ordinary and subscription shares are eligible for inclusion within the stocks and shares component of an ISA.
Life of the Company The Articles of Association of the Company provide that at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2015, and at every fifth Annual General Meeting thereafter, a vote on whether the Company should continue will be proposed as an ordinary resolution.
Business Review The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to set out a business review for shareholders to provide a fair review of the business of the Group during the financial year to 30 April 2012, the position of the Group at the end of the year and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties.
Full details of the Investment Managers activities and its views are given in the Investment Managers Report.
The Board considers that the Chairmans Statement and the Investment Managers Report when read in conjunction with the information provided in the Directors Report fulls the requirements of the business review and gives a comprehensive analysis of the development and performance of the business of the Group and the position of the Group at the end of the financial year.

The outlook for the future performance is dependent to a significant degree on the worlds financial markets and their reactions to economic events and other geo-political forces.
The Chairmans Statement and the Investment Managers Report comment on the outlook.
Investment Objective, Policy and Strategy Objective and policy The Companys investment objective has since formation been, and will continue to be, to maximise long-term capital growth by investing in a diversied portfolio of technology companies around the world.
As commented on in the Chairmans statement and detailed in the Notice of Annual General Meeting the Company is seeking shareholder approval of a simplied investment policy.
This will not change the investment objective but seeks to provide a clear and appropriate set of up to date investment restrictions in line with the Financial Services Authority and HM Revenue and Customs current requirements.
The portfolio has been managed under and in accordance with the policy and restrictions in the year to 30 April 2012 and will continue to be managed in such a way until any changes as proposed in resolution 13 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting are approved by shareholders.
Technology may be dened as the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes and technology companies are dened accordingly.
While this offers a very broad and dynamic investing universe and covers many different companies, the portfolio will be focused on technology companies which use technology or which develop and supply technological solutions as a core part of their business models.
This includes areas as diverse as information, media, communications, environmental, healthcare and renewable energy, as well as the more obvious applications such as computing and associated industries.
Rationale The Directors believe that the rationale for this objective continues to be valid.
Over the last three decades the technology industry has been one of the most vibrant, dynamic and rapidly growing segments of the global economy.
Technology companies offer the potential for substantially faster earnings growth than the broad market, reecting the long-term secular uptrend in technology spending.
Strategy The Company invests its technology assets in a portfolio comprised primarily of international quoted equities which is diversied across both regions and sectors within the overall investment objective to manage investment risk.
Investment approach Equities are selected on the basis of their potential for shareholder returns, not on the basis of technology for its own sake.
Rigorous fundamental analysis is applied with a focus on: management quality: the identication of new growth markets: the globalisation of major technology trends: and exploiting international valuation anomalies and sector volatility.

The maximum exposure to any one market may be 100% but the Board has agreed a set of parameters which are based upon current market conditions and provides a range which guides the Investment Manager depending on market conditions and future expectations.
The Board believes this provides the necessary exibility for the Investment Manager to pursue the investment objective, given the dynamic and rapid changes in the eld of technology, while maintaining a spread of investments.
As well as the market parameters shown below, the Board also monitors the portfolios exposure to different subsectors within technology and the spread of investments across different market capitalisations.
Cyclical changes in markets and new technologies will bring certain sub-sectors or companies of a particular size or market capitalisation into or out of favour.
Market parameters Notwithstanding the ability to invest up to 100% of the portfolio in any one market, with current and foreseeable investment conditions the portfolio will be invested in accordance with the objective across worldwide markets within the following geographical and market parameters: North America up to 85% of the portfolio: Europe up to 40% of the portfolio: Japan and Asia up to 55% of the portfolio: Rest of the world up to 10% of the portfolio.
The Board has set an aggregate limit of 25% of the portfolio that may be exposed to emerging markets as dened by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index with specic upper limits for certain countries.
Largest investment The largest single investment that may be held in the portfolio is currently limited to 5% of the portfolio at the time of acquisition, except for US and UK government bonds, which might be used as part of the cash management process.
Unquoted investments Investment in unquoted companies may be made from time to time where there has been prior Board approval.
These investments in aggregate will not exceed 10% of the portfolio, in each case measured at the time of investment.
Derivatives The Investment Manager may also use from time to time derivative instruments as approved by the Board such as financial futures, options, contracts for difference and currency hedges.
These are used for the purpose of efficient portfolio management only.
Cash and borrowings From time to time the Company may hold cash or near cash equivalents if the Investment Manager feels that these will at a particular time or over a period enhance the performance of the portfolio.
The management of cash is through the purchase of appropriate government bonds, money market funds or bank deposits depending on the Investment Managers view of the investment opportunities.
The Company may also borrow money to invest in the portfolio over both the long and short-term.
Any commitment to borrow funds is agreed by the Board.
Borrowings may be in currencies which best match the currency in which the investments are denominated.
The constitution of the Company permits borrowings of up to 100% of net assets but the limits agreed by the Board set a range of up to 20% at the time of drawing the relevant borrowings.

The total return for the year amounted to a profit after tax of 30,535,000 2011: 68,085,000.
The Companys revenue varies from year to year and the Board considers the dividend position in each year in order to maintain the Companys status as an investment company.
However, due to the level of accumulated revenue losses the Company does not expect to pay a dividend for the foreseeable future and Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend.
The ongoing charges ratio shown on page 26 has been calculated in accordance with new guidance issued by the AIC and constitutes the management fee in note 8 and the other administrative expenses as a percentage of average daily net assets over the year.
Benchmark The Company has a benchmark of the Dow Jones World Technology Index total return, sterling adjusted against which NAV performance is measured for the purpose of assessing performance fees.
As at 30 April 2012 the Dow Jones World Technology Index was calculated as a market capitalisation based index of 519 technology companies worldwide.
74% of the index weighting is in North America, 7% in Europe and 19% in Asia Pacic.
By market capitalisation 79% is represented by large companies, 19% by mid-caps and 2% by smaller companies.
Although the Company has a benchmark, this is neither a target nor an ideal investment strategy.
The purpose of the benchmark is to set a reasonable return for shareholders above which the Investment Manager is entitled to a share of the extra performance it has delivered.
Business Risks In delivering long-term returns to shareholders the identication and monitoring of risk is crucial.
In addition to the detailed internal controls set out in the Corporate Governance Report the Board seeks to identify, assess and monitor risks to the business.
These relate primarily to economic uncertainties and its particular sphere of activity of investing in worldwide stock markets.
The appropriateness of the investment mandate and strategy is considered as this may lead to a depressed share price as investors seek alternative investments or lower risk strategies.
As the Companys assets comprise mainly of listed equities the principal risks to the performance of the business are market related.
While the portfolio is diversied across a number of stock markets worldwide, the investment mandate is focused on technology and thus the portfolio will be more sensitive to investor sentiment and the commercial acceptance of technological developments than a general investment portfolio.
Technology stocks also have greater relative price volatility and are subject to the risks of developing technologies, competitive pressures and other factors including the acceptance of new technologies and rapid obsolescence.
Many companies in the technology sector are smaller companies and are therefore subject to the risks attendant on investing in smaller capitalisation businesses.
There is significant exposure to the economic cycles of Europe, Asia and the US as these are the major investment markets for technology stocks and there is exposure to currency risk of those markets.
A very small element of the investment portfolio is invested into unlisted securities.
These investments are made where they offer specialist management or investment opportunities which would otherwise not be available.
At the year-end this amounted to less than 0.2% of NAV.

There is a second group of business risks in the form of financial, operational including accounting and taxation, and legal and regulatory requirements.
The financial risks which arise from the investment activities expose the Company to risks such as market price, credit, liquidity, foreign currency and interest rates.
The operational and accounting risks cover disruption to, or failure of, systems and processes provided by the Investment Manager including any sub contractors to which the Investment Manager has delegated the task.
Including the keeping of safe custody records and systems provided by the custodian or sub custodians.

Legal and regulatory risks include: compliance with the FSAs Listing Rules and Transparency and Disclosure Rules: meeting the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and other legislation affecting UK companies and compliance with accounting standards.
The policies for managing the risks posed by exposure to market prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit and liquidity are set out in note 31 to the accounts.
Other business risks are managed through regular reporting to the Board on the diversication of the portfolio, market and sector views, the investment strategy including analytical performance data and attribution presented by the Investment Manager.
Any investment in unquoted companies or funds is approved by the Directors before the investment is made.
The Board also receives regular financial information on the Company and discusses the share register and share price performance at each meeting.

Management Company and Management of the Portfolio As the Company is an investment vehicle for shareholders the Directors have sought to ensure that the business of the Company is managed by a leading specialist investment management team and that the investment strategy remains attractive to shareholders.

Report on Corporate Governance The Directors are accountable to shareholders for the governance of the Companys affairs.
The UK Listing Rules require all listed companies to disclose how they have applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the UK Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council the FRC.
The UK Code is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 29 June 2010 so this is the first year reporting under the UK Code.
The UK Code can be viewed at www.
uk As an investment company most of the day to day responsibilities are delegated to outside parties as the Company has no employees and all the Directors are non-executive.
Many of the provisions of the UK Code are not directly applicable to the Company.
The Financial Reporting Council confirmed in 2010 that by following the AIC Code of Corporate Governance AIC Code and the Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies produced by the AIC, boards of investment companies should fully meet their obligations in relation to the UK Code and the UK Listing Rules.
The AIC code and AIC guide address the principles set out in section 1 of the UK Code as well as additional principles and recommendations on issues that are specic to investment trusts.
The AIC Code can be viewed at www.
co. uk The Board has determined that reporting against the AIC Code provides the most appropriate information to shareholders.
The Companys policies on corporate governance can be found on its website.
The report on corporate governance describes how the principles of the AIC Code have been applied.

The Board has considered the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code by reference to the AIC Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies AIC Guide and the Board believes that the Companys current practices are consistent in all material respects with the principles of the AIC Code.
Where non compliance occurs, an explanation has been provided.
The Board will continue to observe the principles and recommendations set out in the AIC Code in future.
Directors and Board 1.1 Independence and composition The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall management of the Companys affairs and currently consists of seven non-executive Directors six of whom are considered independent.
Each Director has different qualities and areas of expertise on which they may lead where issues arise.
The Directors in ofce at the year end are listed on pages 36 to 37 along with their biographical details which demonstrate the breadth of investment, commercial and professional experience relevant to their positions as Directors of the Company.
All the Directors, with the exception of Mr Ashford-Russell, were considered independent of the Investment Manager and had no relationship or conicts which were likely to affect their independent judgment.
Consequently the majority of the Board is independent of the Investment Manager and the Board considers that its overall composition is adequate for the effective governance of the Company.
The Directors Remuneration Report is set out on pages 58 to 60.
1.2 Succession planning and diversity While the Board recognises the value of progressive refreshing of and succession planning for company boards, it is conscious of the need to maintain continuity and believes that retaining Directors with sufficient experience of the Company, industry and the markets is of great benefit to shareholders.
The Board is of the opinion that long service does not necessarily compromise the independence or contribution of Directors of investment trusts where continuity and experience can signicantly benefit a board, a view supported by the AIC.
The Boards policy is to ensure that a balance of skills and experience is maintained and regularly refreshed.
The Board has noted the Davies Report on Women on Boards.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for the composition of the Board and it considers not only the existing Board but also if further appointments should be made.
The Nomination Committee seeks to balance the time required, the skills, knowledge and experience of individual Directors to form an effective and efficient Board.
When considering new appointments the Nomination Committee seeks to have a list of candidates for the whole Board to consider that will enhance the Board or replace and refresh skills lost through a Director leaving the Board.
As such the Board has not set specic targets, but due regard will be given to the benets of diversity on the Board, including gender, when further appointments are considered.
1.3 Election and Retirement of Directors at the AGM The Articles of Association permits the Board to appoint further Directors without shareholder approval but subject to any such Directors standing for election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment.
Two independent Directors, Mrs Bates and Mr Hames, joined the Board on 30 June 2011 and were elected by the shareholders at the AGM in 2011.
Mr Wakeling, who had been a Director and Chairman of the Board since 1996, retired at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 4 August 2011.
All Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, subject to re-election, as required by the Articles of Association.
The Articles of Association and the Companies Act provide for the removal of a Director.

Any Director who has served over nine years and stands for re-election due to length of service is carefully and rigorously assessed by the Nominations Committee to ensure that the Director continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board and remains independent in character and judgement.
Notwithstanding these requirements, the UK Code requires all directors of FTSE350 companies to retire annually.
Therefore all the Directors will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, be eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The Nomination Committee, as part of the Director and Board performance evaluation, has carefully reviewed and rigorously assessed the contribution of each Director standing for re-election and their independence.
They determined that each Director continued to offer relevant experience, effectively contributed to the operation of the Board and had demonstrated independent views on a range of subjects.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, supports each of the Directors standing for re-election.
1.4 Directors interests Mr Ashford-Russell is a partner of Polar Capital LLP and a shareholder in Polar Capital Holdings plc, the ultimate holding company of Polar Capital LLP and as such he has an interest in the investment management contract.
He is therefore not considered to be an independent Director.
However, the Board values the fact that Mr AshfordRussell, although no longer actively involved in the day to day management of the portfolio, serves as a Director of the Company and gives the Directors and shareholders the benefit of his experience and knowledge.
The Chairman of the Company is a non-executive Director and has no conicting relationships.
It should be noted that Mr Gamble and Mr Moule have a common directorship at another investment trust but this is not considered to affect their ability to act independently.
No Director, except Mr Brian Ashford-Russell, has any links with the Investment Manager, Polar Capital LLP.
There were no other contracts during or at the end of the year in which a Director of the Company is or was materially interested and which is or was significant in relation to the Companys business.
The Directors interests in the ordinary and subscription shares of the Company are set out in the Share Capital section of the Directors Report.
1.5 Conicts of interests Directors have a duty to avoid a situation in which they have or could have a conict of interest or possible conict with the interests of the Company.
With effect from October 2008 the Company introduced additional procedures to handle such situations.
Under the Companies Act 2006 public companies may authorise conicts or potential conicts if the Articles of Association contain provisions to this effect and the Companys Articles of Association contain such provisions.
The Board has always had in place policies to govern situations where a potential conict of interests may arise, in particular where a Director is also a director of a company in which the Company invests or may invest.
Where such a situation arises, these Directors are excluded from any discussions or decisions relating to investments in their respective companies.
Each Director has provided the Company with a statement of all conicts of interest and potential conicts of interest.
These have been approved by the Board and recorded in a register.
The Board may impose conditions on authorising any conict or potential conict situations.
Each Director has agreed to notify the Chairman and the Company Secretary of any changes to his circumstances which would impact on the notied conicts or potential conicts and obtain approval before entering into any situation which might give rise to a conict or potential conict with the interests of the Company.

No Director has declared receipt of any benets other than his emoluments in his capacity as a Director of the Company.
Only Directors not involved in the conict or potential conict participate in the authorisation process.
Directors in deciding whether to authorise a situation take into account their duty to promote the Companys success.
The Board has considered the register of conicts, any conditions imposed on such conicts or potential conicts and the operation of the notication and authorisation process.
They concluded that the process has operated effectively since its introduction.
Except as disclosed above in relation to Mr Ashford-Russells interest in the contract with Polar Capital LLP there were no contracts subsisting during or at the end of the year in which a Director is or was interested and which is or was significant in relation to the Companys business or to the Director.
1.6 Directors professional development When a new Director is appointed he or she is offered an induction course provided by the Investment Manager.
Directors are also provided on a regular basis with key information on the Companys policies, regulatory and statutory obligations and internal controls.
Changes affecting Directors responsibilities are advised to the Board as they arise.
Directors also regularly participate in professional and industry seminars.
The Boards role and responsibilities The Board meets regularly and six scheduled Board meetings were held to deal with the stewardship of the Company and other matters.
A formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by the full Board.
During the course of the year the Board has consider the setting and monitoring of investment strategy, portfolio performance, the preparation and review of financial statements, approval of borrowing limits within which the Investment Manager has discretion to act, and shareholder issues including investor relations.
The level of share price discount or premium to Net Asset Value together with policies for re-purchase or issuance of new shares including the use of treasury shares are kept under review along with matters affecting the industry and the evaluation of third party service providers.
Through this process the Board supervises the management of the investment portfolio, the work of the Investment Manager, the risks to which the Company is exposed and their mitigation and the quality of services received by the Company.
A strategy meeting is held each year where past performance attribution is examined and future investment ideas are discussed.
Additional meetings of the Board are arranged as required.
The Board has delegated to a number of standing committees specic remits for consideration and recommendation but the final responsibility in these areas remains with the Board.
Should it be necessary, a procedure has been adopted for Directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company.
No such advice has been sought during the past year.

Senior Independent Director The Board elected Mr Dicks to act as the Senior Independent Director.
Mr Dicks can be contacted via the Registered Ofce of the Company.
Board Committees The Board has created four standing committees whose terms are described below.
The Board also creates ad hoc committees from time to time to enact or approve policies or actions agreed in principle by the whole Board.
Copies of the terms of reference for each of the standing committees are available on the Companys website.
The composition of the standing committees was reviewed on the appointment of Mrs Bates and Mr Hames.
4.1 Audit Committee The Audit Committee meets three times a year and comprises of all the independent non-executive Directors.

The Audit Committees policy on the provision of non audit services is to ensure that there is a clear separation of audit work and non-audit work and that the cost of any non-audit work is justied and not disproportionate to the audit fees to the extent that the independence of the auditors would be compromised.
The fees paid to  LLP in respect of the audit of the annual accounts amounted to 30,000 2011: 32,000.
The Company has also used  LLP to give advice on taxation matters in particular VAT recoverability and recovery of overseas withholding taxes.
These taxation services are provided by the Newcastle ofce while the audit work is carried out by the Edinburgh ofce.
The fees paid for the taxation advice services amounted to 6,000 2011: 25,000.
The Directors do not consider the provision of this non-audit work to the Company affects the independence of the auditors.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the scope of the annual audit, the annual financial statements and the half year report and financial statements.
The terms of appointment of the auditors and their remuneration as well as any non-audit services provided by the auditors are also reviewed by the Committee.
Representatives of the Investment Manager report to the Committee and it receives reports on the quality and effectiveness of the accounting records and management information maintained on behalf of the Company.
The Committee also considers the internal controls and risk management systems applicable to the Company.
The Committee meets with the auditors each April to review the scope of the annual audit work and meets again each June to review the findings of the auditors and review the annual report and financial statements prior to recommending approval by the Board.
The auditors are given the opportunity to speak to the Committee without the representatives of the Investment Manager being present.
The Committee also meets in December each year to consider the half-year report without the auditors present.
There has been nothing brought to the Audit Committees attention in respect of the 2012 audit which was material or significant or that they felt should be brought to shareholders attention.
The Audit Committee annually reviews the performance of  LLP, the Companys external auditor.
In doing so the Audit Committee considers a range of factors including the quality of service, the auditors specialist expertise and the level of audit fee.
The Audit Committee remains satisfied with their effectiveness and therefore has not considered it necessary, to date, to require the external auditors to tender for the audit work.
The independence and effectiveness of the auditors and the nature of the services provided have therefore been assessed throughout the year.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the choice of external auditor.
Under Company Law the reappointment of the external auditor is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
The Audit Committee has recommended the reappointment of the auditors at the AGM.
4.2 Management Engagement Committee The Management Engagement Committee meets at least annually and at such other times as may be necessary.
All independent non-executive Directors are members of the Management Engagement Committee which is chaired by the Chairman of the Board.
The Committee is responsible for the review of the terms of the investment management contract which is reviewed annually and the Committee also considers, prior to making its recommendation to the Board, whether the retention of the Investment Manager is in the interests of shareholders.
The Committee also considers other matters to do with the relationship with the Investment Manager.

The Committee meets at least annually and is responsible to the Board for the size and structure of the Board as well as for succession planning and the tenure policy for Directors.
Succession planning will be conducted bearing in mind the balance of skills, knowledge and experience existing on the Board and the Committee will make recommendations to the Board when the further recruitment of non-executive Directors is required.
The Chairman does not participate in any discussion or decision on his role or replacement.
Once a decision has been made that additional Directors are to be recruited then candidates will be drawn from suggestions put forward by the other Directors and by the use of external agencies.
The final selection will be made by the Board following recommendations by the Committee.
The Committee also reviews the performance of the Board as a whole and each individual Director.
Re-appointment as a Director is not automatic and will follow a process of evaluation of each Directors performance.
The Board acknowledges the rationale of the UK Code for the rigorous review of Directors serving over six years and annual re-appointment after nine years.
Nevertheless the Board shares the view of the AIC that length of service will not necessarily compromise the independence or contribution of directors of investment trusts where continuity and experience can signicantly strengthen a board.
4.4 Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises of Mrs Bates, Mr Montagu and is chaired by Mr Dicks, the Senior Independent Director.
The Committee meets at least annually and is responsible for recommending the framework for the remuneration of Directors.
The Committee reviews the ongoing appropriateness of the remuneration policy and the individual remuneration of Directors based on their contributions.
The fees paid to Directors are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 60.
Performance Evaluation 5.1 The Board The evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors is normally carried out annually by the Chairman of the Nomination Committee.
The Chairman has put in place an appraisal system that seeks the views of each Director by a questionnaire and interviews.
The Chairmans review is conducted by the Senior Independent Director.
These reviews are reported to the Nomination Committee.
In evaluating each Director, they are assessed on their relevant experience, their strengths and weaknesses in relation to the overall requirements of the Board and their commitment to the Company in terms of time by regular attendance of Board meetings.
The process is constructed to assess the contribution of individual Directors to the overall operation of the Board and its Committees as well as to indentify areas of improvement in the operation of the Board and its committees.
In accordance with the UK Code the Board is required to engage an external facilitator for the Board evaluation process every three years.
In 2009 the Board commissioned a third party to undertake an independent review of the effectiveness of the Board and the level of Directors fees which was reported to the Board in February 2010 and disclosed the 2010 annual report.
The next independent review will be reported in the annual report in 2013.
The Nomination Committee has overseen the performance evaluation process and the succession planning designed to replace gradually the longest serving Directors.

The Directors have access to the advice and services of the corporate company secretary through its appointed representative who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with.
The Board and Investment Manager operate in a supportive, co-operative and open environment.
Accountability and audit The Statement of Directors Responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on pages 61 and 62 and the Independent Auditors Report is on pages 63 and 64.
Internal controls The Board has overall responsibility for the Companys system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Company has no employees as its operational functions are carried out by third parties and the Audit Committee does not consider it necessary for the Company to establish its own internal audit function.
Contracts with each of these parties were entered into after full and proper consideration by the Board of the quality and cost of the services offered, including the control systems in operation in so far as they relate to the affairs of the Company.
The Investment Manager is responsible for the day to day investment management decisions on behalf of the Group and for the provision of accounting and administrative services including company secretarial and accounting.

The process has been in place since 2000 and is documented through the use of a Risk Map which is subject to regular review by the Board and accords with the Revised Guidance for Directors on the UK Code published in October 2005 by the Financial Reporting Council.
The controls are embedded within the business and aim to ensure that identied risks are managed and systems are in place to report on such risks.
The internal controls seek to ensure the assets of the Company are safeguarded, proper accounting records are maintained and the financial information used in the Group and for publication is reliable.
Controls covering the risks identied, including financial, operational, compliance and risk management are monitored by a series of regular reports covering investment performance, attribution analysis, reports from various third parties and from the Investment Manager including risks not directly the responsibility of the Investment Manager.
The process was active throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this annual report.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate risks of failure to achieve the Companys business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has received formal reports from the Investment Manager with details of any known internal control failures.
The Board considers reports on the Investment Managers internal controls and systems operated by other third party suppliers.
The Board also receives and considers ad hoc reports from the Investment Manager and information is supplied to the Board as required.
The Board also examined the risks and controls operated by the Investment Manager when placing investment trades with third parties.
The Investment Manager has delegated the provision of accounting, portfolio valuation and trade processing to HSBC Securities Services UK Limited but remains responsible to the Company for these functions and provided the Board with information on these services.
The Board, assisted by the Investment Manager, undertakes an annual review of the Companys system of internal control where the Risk Map is reviewed and control processes considered.
The Board will continue to monitor the system of internal controls in order to provide assurance that they operate as intended.
The Board, assisted by the Investment Manager, has conducted an annual review of the risk map and the effectiveness of the system of internal controls taking into account any issues, none of which were considered significant, which arose during the course of the year ended 30 April 2012 and up to the date of this report.
The Board reviewed the implications of the Bribery Act 2010 and has discussed with the Investment Manager their Policy and the controls and monitoring operated by the Investment Manager not only the internal controls but the steps taken to implement their policy across the main contactors which supply goods and services to the Investment Manager and the Company.
Relations with shareholders The Board and the Investment Manager consider maintaining good communications with shareholders and engaging with larger shareholders through meetings and presentations a key priority.
Shareholders are kept informed by the publication of annual and interim reports which include financial statements.
These reports are supplemented by interim management statements, the daily release of the net asset value per share to the London Stock Exchange and the publication by the Investment Manager of a monthly factsheet.
All this information together with the Investment Managers presentations is available from the Companys website at www.
co. uk The Board is also keen that the AGM be a participative event for all shareholders who attend.
The Investment Managers make a presentation and shareholders are encouraged to attend.
The Chairmen of the Board and of the Committees attend the AGM and are available to respond to queries and concerns from shareholders.
Twenty working days notice of the AGM has been given to shareholders and separate resolutions are proposed in relation to each substantive issue.

The Company has made arrangements for investors through the Alliance Savings Scheme to receive all Company communications and have the ability to direct the casting of their votes.
The Company has also made arrangements with its registrar for shareholders, who own their shares direct rather than through a nominee or share scheme, to view their account over the Internet at www.

The Board monitors the share register of the Company: it also reviews correspondence from shareholders at each meeting and maintains regular contact with major shareholders.

The Company has delegated responsibility for voting to the Investment Manager.
In the year under review, the Manager has voted at 58 Company meetings in each case following the recommendations of the management of that company on the casting of votes.

Statement of Compliance The AIC Code comprises 21 principles.
The Board consider for the year under review the Directors, Board and Company has complied with the recommendations of the AIC Code in so far as they apply to the Companys business and with the relevant provisions of the UK Code except as noted below: As all Directors are non executive and day to day management has been contracted to third parties the Company does not have a separate role for a Chief Executive from that of Chairman of the Board: as there are no executive Directors it does not comply with the UK Code in respect of executive directors remuneration: and the Company does not have an internal audit function as it relies on the systems of control operated by third party suppliers in particular those of the Investment Manager.
The Board monitors these systems of internal control to provide assurance that they operate as intended.
