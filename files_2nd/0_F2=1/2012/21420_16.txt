Business review Financial review Capital structure The information on this page forms an integral part of the audited financial statements.
Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Capital is primarily required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators FSA, Lloyds, Central Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors.
Beazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union EU Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
We comply with all IGD requirements.
Further capital requirements come from rating agencies who provide ratings for the syndicates, Beazley Insurance Company Inc and on a groupwide basis.
We aim to manage our capital levels to obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred client base.
Beazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements.
The amount of surplus capital held is considered on an ongoing basis in light of the current regulatory framework, opportunities for organic or acquisitive growth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital structure and has taken steps in 2012 to diversify its sources of capital while reducing its cost of debt.
Our preferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However there may be times in the cycle when the group will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
At such points in time the board will consider returning capital to shareholders.
In 2012 Beazley acquired 9.5m of its own shares.
These were acquired at an average price of 166p and the cost to the group was $25.1m.
17.5m treasury shares were cancelled in full during the year with a value of $30.1m.
Our funding comes from a mixture of our own equity of $1,211.7m alongside 102.7m of tier 2 subordinated debt, $18m subordinated long-term debt, a 75.0m retail bond and an undrawn banking facility of $225.0m as detailed on page 45.

The cash transfers occur half-yearly in arrears and are reected as unavailable until the cash is received into Beazley corporate accounts.
In addition certain items other than xed and intangible assets such as deferred tax assets are not immediately realisable as cash and have also accordingly been reected as unavailable surplus.
Beazley 46 Annual report 2012 Business review Individual capital assessment The group is required to produce an individual capital assessment ICA which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that ICAs are consistent across the market.
The current capital assessment has been established using our Solvency II internal model which has been run within the ICA regime as prescribed by Lloyds.
In order to determine the capital assessment, we have made significant investments in both models and process: We use sophisticated mathematical models that reect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and The internal model process is embedded so that the teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward prole of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
The increase in our funds at Lloyds from 482.9m to 558.0m is in proportion to the increase in business planned and the changes in the economic conditions.
These numbers are presented in the table on the previous page in US dollars, being $876.0m and $742.9m for 2013 and 2012 respectively, which have been translated at the spot exchange rate at reporting dates.
Solvency II Beazley has set two guiding principles for Solvency II, namely: to develop a framework that can be used to inform management and assist with business decision making: and to hold an appropriate and efficient level of capital for the agreed risk appetite through risk identication and mitigation.
During 2012 the dedicated project management team and subject matter experts completed all outstanding activities for Lloyds.
We confirmed our Final Application Status to Lloyds, including a conrmation that we were expecting to be fully compliant by the end of 2012 and a detailed Target Operating Model, describing the business as usual processes for maintaining ongoing compliance with the tests and standards.
We embedded the SII internal model and all the new processes into the business, taking further advantage of our improved management information and decision making processes, and had our capital approved for 2013 using the new model.
All Pillar I and Pillar II aspects of SII have now been fully transferred into business as usual.
The remaining work on Pillar III reporting and disclosure will be completed in line with the Lloyds plan over the next few years.
We also went through an extensive review process with the FSA and engaged actively with our group regulator, the Central Bank of Ireland, where we made good progress with the pre-application process for Beazley Re and Beazley plc, with a number of aspects of the SII internal model already having been reviewed in depth.
During 2013 we will continue to work with Lloyds, the FSA and the Central Bank of Ireland to facilitate any further reviews, to further embed the model and the procedures, and to prepare ourselves for the regime coming into force, which is now assumed to be in 2016 at the earliest.
