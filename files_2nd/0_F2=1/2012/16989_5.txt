Directors Report: Review of the year Understanding Our Markets Weir operates in three key markets: minerals, oil & gas and power.
Together, these markets contribute 90% of Group revenue.
Minerals 1 Mining sector commodity mix Weir operates primarily in the global minerals processing sector, with growing exposure to the Canadian oil sands, where oil is often recovered through a surface mining Copper 26% process.
Our equipment and services are applied across Gold 18% the mill circuit, the surface process by which rock ores Iron 14% are broken down into end commodities such as copper, Coal 7% gold or iron ore. Our largest exposures are to those Phosphate 4% commodities with positive underlying fundamentals Alumina Bauxite 4% and which require the greatest amount of processing, Nickel 4% such as copper and gold.
Zinc 2% Platinum 2% Growth drivers for minerals markets are population growth Diamonds 1% and urbanisation, driven particularly by emerging markets, Other minerals 17% resulting in growing infrastructure, industrial and consumer demand.
Mining house capital expenditure in greeneld, browneld and replacement projects drives original equipment revenues and grows our installed equipment 2 base.
Minerals production trends drive aftermarket Forecast copper demand versus supply revenues as the installed base of equipment is exposed Kt contained copper to wear and abrasion and global ore grades decline, requiring more processing to produce the same amount 22,000 00 of raw commodity.

History 2012 Projections 8 The North American onshore unconventional market is our largest, with international unconventional opportunities beginning to emerge.
We serve our markets in three main 6 ways: pressure-pumping equipment and services, where cementing and hydraulic fracturing is used in onshore and 4 offshore oil and gas wells: pressure control equipment and services, which ensure drilling, completion and production processes can be carried out efficiently and 2 safely: and Weir Oil & Gas Services, where dedicated engineering support and spares are provided to Weir and third party onshore and offshore oileld equipment, 2005 2020 as well as for desalination plants.
