The key principles adopted in the preparation of the management basis of reporting are described below.
in order to reflect the impact of the acquisition of HBOs, the amortisation of purchased intangible assets has been excluded: and the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments is shown as one line in the management basis income statement, other than unwind related to asset sales which is included within the effects of asset sales, volatile items and liability management.
in order to better present business performance the effects of liability management, volatile items and asset sales are shown on a separate lines in the management basis income statement and underlying profit is profit before taking into account these items and fair value unwind.
comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The following items, not related to acquisition accounting, have also been excluded: simplification, Ec mandated retail business disposal costs and integration costs: payment protection insurance provision: other regulatory provisions: certain past service pension credits in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes: amortisation of purchased intangibles: volatility arising in insurance businesses: and insurance gross up.
To enable a better understanding of the Groups core business trends and outlook, certain income statement, balance sheet and regulatory capital information is analysed between core and non-core portfolios.
The non-core portfolios consist of businesses which deliver below-hurdle returns, which are outside the Groups risk appetite or may be distressed, are subscale or have an unclear value proposition, or have a poor fit with the Groups customer strategy.
The Ec mandated retail business disposal Project Verde is included in core portfolios.
A full reconciliation of the management to the statutory basis is given in note 4 on pages 229 to 234. unless otherwise stated, the commentaries on pages 44 to 75 are on a management basis.
