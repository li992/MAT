Our general policy is to invest in modern robust and proven technologies and to use high quality suppliers without putting too much business with any individual one of them.
We ensure clear contract terms on a xed price basis passing back relevant risks to our suppliers and back this up with careful contract management and independent certication.

We are taking a similar approach on the other projects in our pipeline.
