Key performance indicators We use eight financial and non financial key performance indicators KPIs to implement and monitor the performance of the Group against our strategy, in addition to income statement measures of performance.
Furthermore, it is a key principle of the Group to align the interests of the Directors and other employees with those of its shareholders.
Executive remuneration therefore includes two measures linked to our KPIs, namely adjusted profit before tax growth used for the Annual Performance Bonus scheme and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth used for the Long Term Incentive Plan, details of which can be found in the Report on Directors remuneration.
The eight KPIs and how we performed against them are set out below.
