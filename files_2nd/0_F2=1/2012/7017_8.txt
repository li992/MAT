Over the last five years our average revenue growth has been 7% p. a. which is 2% in excess rate of annual organic profit growth has been 9% p. a. of our minimum target.
2013 target The Board has established a long-term minimum organic growth target of 5% p. a. representing the blended long-term average growth rate of our markets.
This target remains appropriate given the Groups achievement of an overall revenue and profit objective of growing by 15% p. a. after acquisition revenue and profit are taken into account.
In order to meet the target of organic growth in excess of 5%, the Group will need to maintain its focus on investment in innovation, people development and geographic expansion in order to ensure the momentum developed over recent years is continued.
The primary factors affecting our ability to meet the target relate to competitive innovations overtaking the Groups technology and macro-economic factors.
