The Company follows the established procedure in the Companies Act 2006 for changing articles of association and has no other rules about the amendment of the Companys articles of association.
Changes to the Articles of Association Following recent amendments to the Companies Act 2006 and the investment trust taxation rules, the Company is seeking the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting for a change to its Articles of Association so as to allow the Company to pay dividends to shareholders by taking account of its capital reserves as well as its income reserves.
Before these legislative changes, the Company was prohibited from applying capital profits and surpluses arising from the realisation of investments in the payment of dividends, although these amounts could be used for the purposes of other distributions.
The Articles of Association accordingly contained relevant prohibitions in this regard.
Given that these restrictions have been removed, this constitutional prohibition is no longer appropriate.
Accordingly, Resolution 13 to be proposed as a special resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting proposes to amend the Articles of Association by removing Article 124 C and making certain consequential changes to the rest of Article 124.
Following this change, the Company will continue to operate as an investment trust under the investment trust taxation rules and as an investment company under the Companies Act 2006.
The full terms of the new Articles of Association of the Company which will apply if Resolution 13 is passed, together with a version showing the changes proposed, are available for inspection until the close of the Annual General Meeting at the registered ofce of theCompany.
The Board considers that all the resolutions to be put to the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
Those Directors who are shareholders will be voting in favour of them and the Board unanimously recommends that you do so as well.
