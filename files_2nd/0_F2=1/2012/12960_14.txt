Development of the Kibali project is being supported by a thermal power station for low rainfall periods managed by Randgold.
Open pit mineral reserves were reported at a gold price of US$1 000 oz and an average cut-off of 0.9g t cut-off and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Open pit mineral reserves were calculated by Mr Nicholas Coomson, an officer of the company and competent person.
Underground mineral reserves were reported at a gold price of US$1 000 oz and a cut-off of 2.2g t and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Underground mineral reserves were calculated by Mr Dan Donald and Mr Tim Peters, both independent consultants and competent persons.

The revised total capital for Phase 1 is now estimated at approximately US$990 million in 2013 real terms while Phase 2 is estimated at US$670 million in 2013 real terms, which represents an overall 6% increase on previous estimates.
A large part of this increase reects ination, changes which relate to scope as well as additional expenditure on the Relocation Action Plan RAP project.
Health and safety Notwithstanding the rapid increase in activity and number of employees to more than 4 000 on the site at year end, the project signicantly improved their safety awareness, and the LTIFR rate reduced by 71% compared to the prior year.
Regrettably one fatality was recorded and, consequently, the board and management of Kibali introduced new measures to intensify the focus on safety with a plan to improve the Kibali LTIFR rate in line with Randgolds targets.
