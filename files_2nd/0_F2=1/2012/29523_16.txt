The models help to estimate potential future losses arising from credit, market and other risks, and using regulatory formulae, the amount of capital required to support them.
In addition, the models enable the Group to gain an enhanced understanding of its risk pro le, e. g. by identifying potential concentrations and assessing the impact of portfolio management actions.
Stress testing and scenario analysis are used to ensure that the Groups internal capital assessment considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on its risk pro le and capital position.
They provide an insight into the potential impact of signi cant adverse events and how these could be mitigated.
We use a capital model to assess the capital demand for material risks, and support this with our internal capital adequacy assessment.
Each material risk is assessed, relevant mitigants considered, and appropriate levels of capital determined.
The capital modelling process is a key part of our management disciplines.
A strong governance and process framework is embedded in our capital planning and assessment methodology.
The key capital management committees are the Capital Management Committee CMC and the Group Asset and Liability Committee GALCO.
GALCO approves the capital governance frame work and delegates the approval of capital management policies toCMC.
