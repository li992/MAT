Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 35 In 2011, we introduced and communicated our Golden Rules.
The Golden Rules reinforce the HSES Policy, associated procedures and standards, and have been established to help prevent the most common causes of serious incidents in our industry.
Continued implementation of the Golden Rules during 2012 has been a key part of our commitment to excellence and continuous improvement in health and safety performance.
Premier continues to ensure that every employee, contractor and individual at our operations understands company rules and expectations.
Every employee is accountable and has a personal responsibility for health, safety and environment.
Employees are also expected to stop the job if they see or believe something can be better controlled or is unsafe.
Premier has been certified to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 since 2004 for global drilling and since 2006 for our Indonesian production operations.
In 2012, we completed a number of OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 surveillance audits on our production and drilling operations.
During 2012 Drilling, Anoa and Balmoral Production retained their certifications and Gajah Baru was added to the scope of our Indonesian production operations certificate.
Our Chim So production operation in Vietnam is working towards OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 certification in 2013.
Occupational safety performance In 2012, we worked 6.1 million man-hours 2011: 7.2 million man-hours.
This decrease on the previous year was due to reductions in drilling man-hours from 1.7 million in 2011 to 0.8 million in 2012 and in construction from 2.8 million in 2011 to 2.0 million in 2012.
Most of these man-hours 4.3 million vs. 5.9 million in 2011 were worked by contractors on our operations.
We expect to see a progressive increase in man-hours during 2013 with a number of new projects continuing and coming into the construction phase.

Note: All safety statistics include both Premier employees and contractors.
Total recordable injuries Our overall TRIR performance improved significantly from 2.4 in 2011 to 1.8 in 2012, showing a continued improvement in performance over the last three years and meeting our 2.0 target.
TRIR performance at our construction operations was exceptional at 0.0 2011: 1.8, much improved at our production operations at 2.8 2011: 6.1 but poor at our drilling operations at 7.5 2011: 0.0.
This overall positive trend in our TRIR performance was largely due to significant improvements at our North Sea operations where rates improved from 9.4 in 2011 to 4.5 in 2012: following a series of site-specific safety initiatives and leadership courses to address the previously high number of mostly minor accidents including slips, falls and finger injuries at our production facilities.
Our operations in Asia continued to perform well with a TRIR score of 0.9 2011: 1.5.
Process safety performance Insight into High Potential Incidents HIPOs and their rate of occurrence enable us to learn about how to mitigate future incidents, often by addressing the root causes.
We believe these HIPOs act as a leading indicator of potential injury and complement the continued testing of asset integrity through our Project Safety Reviews PSRs and Safety Case processes.
36 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT continued High potential incidents Last year saw a slight increase in HIPOs per million man-hours from 0.8 in 2011 to 1.3 in 2012.
This was well within our target of 2.0.
The increase in rate from 2011 was due to a significant decrease in the number of man-hours but a small increase in the number of high potential incidents from six in 2011 to eight in 2012, seven of which occurred at our Asia operations.
Performance improved at our construction operations where there were zero high potential incidents in 2012 2011: one.
All of the eight high potentials reported in 2012 were investigated in-depth, corrective actions identified and their implementation monitored.
Safety alerts based on each incident were made available to all employees in order to share learning across the group.
Safety alerts are mandatory for all HIPOs but may also be issued where there are incidents or events that require heightened awareness and caution.
Loss of primary containment Measurement of loss of primary containment LOPC is a new metric proposed by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers OGP.
We recognise further work is required to harmonise process safety performance measurement across the industry: and continue to work with OGP as members of its process safety sub-committee to develop an industry approach to indicators and reporting that includes leading metrics.
It is anticipated OGP will publish the first LOPC industry data in 2013, and that this will be able to be used to set future Premier targets.
In 2012, there were 41 LOPC events 2011: 35 at our operations.
Of these none were Tier 1 LOPC events 2011: one.
There were seven reported Tier 2 events 2011: five.
The remaining minor events 34 included small gas leaks and contained oil spills that did not reach the environment.
Tier 1 events are those where there is a significant loss of containment from a process system, i. e. gas over 500kg and oil over 1,000kg outdoor.
Tier 2 are those releases of lesser consequence, i. e. gas over 50kg and oil over 100kg outdoor and some events defined by American Petroleum Institute API.
We measure the number of incidents or rate per activity man-hour LOPCR at both our operated drilling and production operations and sum it as a company metric.
Safety by design Premier has integrated process safety protocols into the PSRs of all its projects.
These reviews provide assurance that material HSE issues have been identified and are being effectively managed throughout the project lifecycle.
A typical project lifecycle will require six strategic reviews as a project moves from concept to construction and then to operation.
These PSRs align with our project approval gates, at which time strategic decisions are made to either progress a project further towards the operations stage or to delay or divest.
Safety cases are in place at all of our operated installations.
This safety case regime is aligned with the regulated standards in the United Kingdom.
We believe this represents best practice and we are committed to implementing such cases at all of our operated production facilities worldwide, even when not required by the local regulatory regime.
A safety case is developed during the early stages of a project and becomes more detailed as a project nears the operation stage.
A safety case must be in place before production commences.
Each case includes a review and impact assessment of the relevant process safety risks, the requirement to meet established safety benchmarks and the adoption of further steps to reduce risks to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable the ALARP principle.
For our operating assets, these are reviewed every five years to ensure continued compliance.
Safety cases are reviewed by either the local regulatory authority or a competent independent third party to provide assurance that they comply with our standards.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 37 Environment ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING FORMS A MAJOR PART OF PREMIERS HSE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS.
WE CONDUCT BASELINE SURVEYS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS FOR EACH NEW OPERATED ACTIVITY.
This involves an assessment of the physical, socio-economic and biological environments including the rights of indigenous peoples and biodiversity.
We measure and review each impact in turn and gauge both its significance and how it can be reduced to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable.
Potential actions to improve environmental performance are screened based on cost, duration and impact to determine which are feasible for implementation.
We periodically review these environmental impacts and actions for our existing facilities to ensure we are complying with our policy of continuous improvement.
Environmental indicators and targets We report our environmental performance in line with the IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting 2010 and to meet GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.
Our emissions performance is benchmarked by contributing our data to an industry database compiled and published by the OGP.
As an oil company with production facilities in the North Sea, we also comply with the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and submit an annual, externally verified report on our emissions profile to the Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC.
We also participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project where we achieved a carbon disclosure score of 66 out of 100 in 2012 2011: 66.
