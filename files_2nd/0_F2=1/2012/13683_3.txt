RPC Group Plc 04 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 What we do Rigid plastic packaging is created by heating, shaping and cooling polymer to create unique moulded products.
RPC uses the three main polymer conversion processes that are used in over 90% of rigid plastics manufacture and allows RPC to offer the widest range of plastic packaging solutions to its customers.
The processes employed are Injection Moulding, Blow Moulding and Thermoforming, each technology producing different product characteristics that are suitable for specific packaging applications.
Operations in RPC are structured along market and technological lines into seven clusters which are aligned to these three conversion processes.
