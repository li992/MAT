The new data included exploration drilling in an area known as Escondida Este, which increased the size of the Escondida deposit, and in-fill drilling that improved confidence on the estimate, increasing Measured Resources by approximately 40% compared with the previous estimate.
2 Pampa Escondida and Pinta Verde are within the Escondida joint venture property.
3 Chimborazo Chimborazo is a new orebody located 15km northwest of Escondida and is within the Escondida joint venture property.
It has been defined by more than 115,000m of drilling from holes that average 530m in depth and are located on nominal grid spacing of 75m to 150m.
The orebody corresponds to a porphyry copper-style deposit and a related hydrothermal breccia system that underlies an average thickness of 100m of leached cap and gravel overburden.
The mineral resource is largely contained in a secondary chalcocite enrichment zone and local enargite, forming a sub-horizontal mineralised body of approximately 500m x 1000m in the horizontal dimension with 50m to 200m thickness.
4 Cerro Colorado The increase in resources was due to the inclusion of two years drilling information.
Changes in the resource classification criteria resulted in movement of Measured Resources to Indicated Resources.
5 Spence Ore type names are modified from previous reporting.
Sulphide now represents hypogene chalcopyrite molybdenite mineralisation and is differentiated from overlying Supergene Sulphide previously called Sulphide and Transitional Sulphide that are currently processed through heap leaching.
The addition of Sulphide resource was partly a result of exploration and infill drilling results, and partly a result of pre-feasibility studies that have demonstrated the potential economic viability for open-pit mining, milling and flotation of the hypogene mineralisation.
6 Pinto Valley Pinto Valley has remained on care and maintenance throughout FY2012.
Mineral Resources in the Sulphide Stockpiles are no longer reported as they are essentially depleted of leachable copper.
7 Olympic Dam The increase to tonnes was due to evaluation with revised metal price forecasts.
8 Cannington The increase to tonnes was due to re-estimation with additional diamond drilling and the application of revised metal price forecasts.
9 Approximate drill hole spacings used to classify the reserves were: Deposit Proved Ore Reserves Probable Ore Reserves Escondida Oxide: 35m x 35m Oxide: 45m x 45m Mixed: 60m x 60m Mixed: 115m x 115m Sulphide: 50m x 50m Sulphide: 90m x 90m Cerro Colorado 55m x 55m on first kriging pass 120m x 120m on second kriging pass Spence Oxide: 50m x 50m Oxide and Sulphide: approximately 100m continuous square grid Sulphide: maximum 75m x 75m Pinto Valley 60m x 120m 200m x 200m Olympic Dam Drilling grid of 20m to 30m Drilling grid of 30m to 70m Antamina 30m drill spacing 55m drill spacing Cannington 12.5m sectional x 15m vertical 25m sectional x 25m vertical 10 Metallurgical recoveries for the operations were: 11 Escondida The increase in reserves was predominantly due to OGP1 approval Deposit Metallurgical Recovery that will deliver double the current flotation capacity allowing improved Escondida Oxide: 69% recovery of lower-grade ores with commensurate expansion of the reserve footprint.
Infill drilling has also contributed to the reserve increase.
Sulphide: 84% 12 Cerro Colorado Change in the reserves was due to additional drilling Sulphide Leach: 36% and subsequent revision of the reserve estimate.
Cerro Colorado 70% average for TCu 13 Spence The increase in reserves was due to reclassification of some low-grade resource to reserves as a result of improved confidence on recovery.
Spence Oxide: 73% 14 Pinto Valley The Pinto Valley mine and mill remained on care and Oxide Low Solubility: 70% maintenance throughout FY2012.
Restart of the mine and mill was recently Sulphide: 70% approved, and activity is underway for production to begin in the first half ROM: 30% of FY2013.
The difference from previous reserves was due to a mine design change to account for minor slope stability issues.
Pinto Valley Mill: 86% 15 Olympic Dam The increase in reserves was mainly due to the addition Leach: 25% of mine development material.
