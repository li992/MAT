Keeping FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW Platinum recorded an underlying operating loss of $120 million in 2012, compared with $890 million underlying operating pro t in 2011.
This was primarily due to lower sales volumes, the impact of higher mining in ation on costs and lower average realised prices.
Platinum sales volumes for the period were lower owing to the two month illegal industrial action experienced at most of the mining operations in the fourth quarter.
This was compensated in part by a weaker average rand against the dollar and a positive stock adjustment of $172 million.
Cash operating costs per equivalent re ned platinum ounce increased by 21% to ZAR16,364 2011: ZAR13,552, primarily due to 01 the impact of the strike and increases in the costs of labour, electricity, diesel and key inputs of processing Markets Autocatalysts operations.

Jewellery Gross platinum demand for the fabrication of jewellery rose by 10% to 2.7 million ounces, as strong demand from China and India balanced generally weaker economic conditions across the globe.
With platinum trading at a discount to gold throughout the year, manufacturers were able to receive higher margins, encouraging the use of platinum in China, while demand in India continues to grow faster than other markets in percentage terms.
Gross demand for platinum for the fabrication of jewellery in China rose by 14% in 2012, to approximately 1.9 million ounces, of which recycled platinum jewellery represented half a million ounces.
Platinum purchases by manufacturers increased by 16% to 1.4 million ounces.

The release of the Canadian Platinum Maple Leaf and the Australian Platinum Platypus bullion coins also boosted interest in demand.
