22 Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Estimating outstanding claims reserves Estimation of claims reserves is a key aspect of financial management in that not only does it impact on overall profitability, but it also impacts investment mix as different approaches are taken for capital and policyholders funds.
At 31 December 2012, net claims reserves totalled 2.6 billion 2011: 2.7 billion.
Insurance business is inherently uncertain and much of Amlins business is large commercial insurance or reinsurance, which can be volatile and difficult to estimate ultimate claims levels for.
The subjectivities that must be considered when assessing the level of outstanding liabilities include the risk profile of an insurance policy, class of business, timeliness of notification of claims, validity of claims made against a policy and validity of the quantum of the claim.
At any time there are a range of possible outcomes at which the claims reserves could ultimately settle, however, as time passes the uncertainty surrounding likely claims settlement reduces.
Given uncertainty, we adopt a prudent approach to the assessment of liabilities, however, consistency of reserving strength is our overall goal.
We estimate that the Group as a whole holds reserves on an accident year basis of at least 160 million in excess of an actuarial best estimate 2011: at least 170 million.
