Annual Report 2012 Randgold Resources 130 | Remuneration report Dear shareholder Randgold has overcome some challenges in 2012 to once again deliver record results.
We increased production by 14%, group profit by 16% and EPS by 12%.
This continued growth evidences the success of the long term strategy.
The final dividend we are proposing is US$0.50 per share, a 25% increase on the prior year.
We again outperformed the HSBC Global Gold Index by 2.7% during the year under review.
The company has signicantly outperformed the FTSE 100, the FTSE 350 and the HSBC Global Gold Index over the last ten and five years.
An investment of 100 in Randgold shares on 1 January 2008 would have resulted in a shareholding worth 327 on 31 December 2012, compared with 111 in the FTSE 100 and 113 in the FTSE 350.
An investment of US$100 in Randgold shares on 1 January 2008 would have been worth US$271 on 31 December 2012 compared with US$100 in the HSBC Global Gold Index.
Our remuneration policy has always been based on the objective of ensuring that the companys executive remuneration policy encourages, reinforces and rewards the delivery of sustainable shareholder value, something we believe has helped to drive our long term outperformance over the past decade.
Our current long term plans extend performance measurement up to five years and require a holding period of one year beyond that performance period.
We have engaged extensively during the year with our largest institutional shareholders and the voting guidance services on pay, and have made various changes to reect their views.
We acknowledge and listen to the views of our shareholders and have taken account of these in our remuneration report.
While our past performance is outstanding we continue to look to the future growing capacity and maintaining quality.
Randgold is currently entering a critical development phase in its business, growing capacity through the building and operation of a new mine in the Democratic Norborne P Cole Jr Republic of Congo, Kibali.
Kibali is the largest project undertaken to date by Randgold, Chairman, remuneration committee with a reserve base at plus 10 million ounces and still growing.
It will rank as one of the largest gold mines in Africa and will add significant future long term sustainable value to Randgold and our shareholders.
This report sets out our remuneration policy for directors to appropriately reward value delivery by our executives and encourage long term sustainable growth for our shareholders.
It also comments on the approach to remuneration for other senior executives.
The principal points to note for 2013 are as follows: Q Base salary increases The chief executive ofcers CEO base salary has been increased from US$1 500 000 to US$1 575 000 with effect from 1 January 2013 - an increase of 5% of base salary.
No other changes have been made to his other pay arrangements and, as he has not received a base salary increase since 1 January 2010, this increase was considered appropriate.
The chief financial ofcers CFO base salary has been increased from 429 000 to 472 000 with effect from 1 January 2013 - an increase of 10% of base salary.
In line with Randgolds remuneration philosophy, the CFO was brought into the CFO role in 2007 on a low salary compared to the market to allow for movement and growth in pay, once his value to Randgold was demonstrated.
The CFO has been a valuable addition to the top team and we have moved his salary over time including in 2011, 2012 and now in 2013.
The committee believes this is reective of his contribution and positions his salary appropriately with our market.
Q EPS growth is a performance metric within the Restricted Share Scheme and is measured as a cumulative compound annual growth rate over performance Annual Report 2012 Randgold Resources 131 | Remuneration report continued periods of three, four and five years.
The growth range to hold ofce or employment with Randgold during a three year required for vesting of shares has been revised from period from the date of award.
