56 Interserve AnnuAl report 2012 GovernAnCe DIreCtors remunerAtIon report DIreCtors remunerAtIon report DAvID tHorpe CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees annual report on directors remuneration.
The Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of current legislation, but in response to the UK Governments new legislation regarding the reporting of directors remuneration and changes to the voting rights, we have incorporated a number of the revised reporting requirements into this years report.
The Groups management has delivered good results in 2012 against the background of mixed market conditions.
In particular, underlying headline earnings per share has increased by 8 per cent and good progress was made on a number of strategic fronts.
From our PFI interests we realised 119 million in cash and effected a 55 million asset transfer to our pension scheme, completed in January 2013.
This represents an excellent performance in delivering enhanced value from these investments through sustained management of the underlying projects.
We also increased our involvement in the delivery of front-line services to the public in the UK through our acquisition of Interserve Working Futures and Advantage Healthcare and expanded our presence in the oil and gas services sector in the Middle East through the acquisition of TOCO in January 2013.
Our share 1 price increased by 21.2 per cent over the year, slightly outperforming our sector.
During the year the Remuneration Committee the Committee was again mindful of the general restraint on pay across the Group.
The salaries of the executive directors were, with the exception of one incremental increase, increased by 2.5 per cent from 1 July 2012 which was broadly in line with the average increase in salaries across the entire business.
The performance conditions for the annual variable pay arrangements were set such that the budgeted normalised earnings per share EPS had to be achieved before any benefit could be derived from the additional normalised EPS arising from the sale of the Groups PFI assets.
Performance was strong, leading to a bonus payment of 100 per cent.
The increase in award levels under the Companys Performance Share Plan from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of basic salary for the Executive Board was accompanied by significantly more demanding EPS performance conditions which require EPS in 2014 to be marginally ahead of the rate of increase in EPS that would result in a doubling of earnings per share over the five-year period from a 2010 base in order for the awards to pay out in full.
However, the Committee remains conscious of the need to strike an appropriate balance between incentivising senior management, providing stretching targets which support the Boards strategic ambitions whilst, at the same time, not encouraging excessive risk taking.
Total remuneration therefore remains close to but not in excess of mid-market levels for similar sized FTSE 250 businesses.
The Committee is mindful that executive pay remains a highly topical issue and continues to monitor best practice and regulatory guidance to ensure that our policy retains a good link between reward to executives and the performance of the business.
A resolution seeking an advisory vote on both the Policy Report and Implementation Report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and I very much hope that you will vote in favour.

In setting and reviewing the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the Committee takes into account a range of different reference points.
Key issues which it considers are: the economic climate in the sectors and geographies in which the Company operates: remuneration policies and practices across the Group as a whole: and the culture and strategy of the business.
reMunerAtIon polICy ACross the Group The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for executive directors and other senior employees, which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility of employees across the Group.
In particular, as remuneration levels overall are higher, performance-linked variable pay comprises a much higher proportion of remuneration at more senior levels and there is more of a focus on Group results, rather than business unit or individual performance.
This provides a stronger alignment of interest between senior executives and investors.
For less senior staff, variable pay comprises annual bonus only participation in the PSP is limited to the top 130 or so senior employees coupled with the opportunity to participate in the SIP and Sharesave Scheme.

The Committee considers that a combination of normalised EPS and TSR for the Executive Board remains the most appropriate measure of performance for awards made under the Plan.
The EPS target rewards significant and sustained increases in value and delivers strong line of sight for the Executive Board whilst the TSR performance condition provides balance by rewarding good relative stock market performance and introduces an element of share price-based discipline to the package.
The blend of these two complementary measures is considered to reduce the risk level of the Plan compared to the position if a single metric applied to the entire award.

Annual Variable Pay is deliverable by a mix of cash and deferred shares.
If an executive directors shareholding in the Company is less than 100 per cent of his basic salary, a percentage of the net Variable Pay receivable in excess of 25 per cent of basic salary is required to be invested in Company shares in accordance with the arrangements stated below: a for the balance of any Variable Pay received between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of basic salary, 30 per cent of the net Variable Pay must be invested in Company shares and 70 per cent may be retained: and b for the balance of any Variable Pay received between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of basic salary, 50 per cent of the net Variable Pay must be invested in Company shares and 50 per cent may be retained.

The performance conditions were set such that Annual Variable Pay of between 20 per cent and 100 per cent of basic salary would become payable upon achievement of between 96.5 per cent and 111 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS.
A performance below 96.5 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS would result in no Annual Variable Pay becoming payable.
The operation of the Annual Variable Pay scheme for the 2012 financial year resulted in a payment of 100 per cent of basic salary as at 31 December 2012 for each executive director, the details of which are shown in the table above.
