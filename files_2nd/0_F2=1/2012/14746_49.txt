There has been no change in the Directors pension entitlements over the year and the increase in value is largely the result of the change in financial conditions since 31 March 2011, notably the significant reduction in bond yields.
If bond yields were to go up, the value would go down.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the table above.
If a members accrued fund exceeds the lifetime allowance LTA, the benets payable by the scheme from that excess will be subject to a higher rate of income tax.
The Company has maximised the use of the allowance to provide Executive Directors with the maximum benets via the registered schemes.
