The Companys green eld exploration programme also produced positive results and its project pipeline was further expanded to include 16 Company Makers and 20 Medium Scale projects.
In 2013, exploration work at the Companys core operations will be mainly focused on identifying new potential and near mine high grade areas to further improve the resource quality.
At the Inmaculada and Crespo Advanced Projects, exploration eff orts will be focused on identifying Samples at Pallancata new potential high grade areas, whilst at Azuca Hochschild will concentrate on the exploration of high quality resources that better support a signi cant investment.
At the Volcan gold deposit in Chile, the Company will commence an extensive technical and geological evaluation of the deposit.
Exploration at the Company Maker projects will include continued drilling and further analysis, and at the A geologist at the Crespo Advanced Project 1 Amount disclosed refers to expenditure from the Groups exploration budget and does not include expenditure from the operational budget.

The property hosts both Soranpampa high-sulphidation as well as porphyry Victoria: Chile style disseminated copper and gold The Victoria project is located in northern mineralisation.
The property has been Chile and is 66% owned by Hochschild, PERU explored by a number of mining with the remaining 34% held by Iron companies in the past, including Phelps Creek Capital.
The exploration programme Dodge 1989-1991 and Barrick 1995- is delivering positive results at the 1997, which completed drill campaigns property which covers 46,100 hectares totalling 12,575 metres.
