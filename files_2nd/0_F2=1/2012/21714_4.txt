Report on AllBlue Limited AllBlue by BlueCrest Capital Management UK LLP and BlueCrest Capital Management LLP for the year ended 31 December 2012 In 2012, markets were driven by extraordinary policy intervention and stimulus, surrounded by political rhetoric that made predictions of performance more challenging as macro economics and fundamental valuations had a lower impact.
To a large extent, investor behaviour was driven by a cycle of fear followed by supportive central bank action and then relief, both in Europe and the US.
In Europe, as the Greek crisis intensified and other peripheral countries economies deteriorated, the ECB stepped in to calm markets with a second round of LTRO Long Term Refinancing Operation liquidity.
The restored confidence in the Eurozone was short lived, as markets reversed sharply in second quarter and this time the ECBs response was to offer forceful promises of bond buying through Outright Monetary Transactions OMT which did reduce the panic in the third quarter.
Investors fears then rotated to weakness in the US economy, partially helped by the Feds actions with QE3.
After the presidential election, concerns turned to the debt burden and the Fiscal Cliff, addressed by Congress with a last minute agreement at year end.
These shifts in sentiment led to distinct periods of risk on and risk off behaviour in markets, resulting in few sustained macro trends and a decline in volatility.
Despite the challenging environment, the fund performed well as the estimated 2012 return for AllBlue Class A USD is 5.97%, with 12 month annualised volatility of 2.36% and 12 month correlation to the MSCI World Index of -0.08.
All underlying funds delivered positive performance for 2012, with the exception of the small allocation to BlueMatrix.
The discretionary trading funds employ a specialist model, consisting of a group of traders and strategies each with a dedicated area of focus.
This enabled returns to be generated from specific opportunities within each segment which when aggregated across the markets covered resulted in consistent gains for the portfolios.
Systematic strategies faced more challenging conditions.
The greatest contributors to AllBlue performance were BlueCrest Capital International, BlueCrest Emerging Markets and BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit, with BlueCrest Mercantile and BlueTrend Alignment also adding more modestly to returns.
15 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER OF ALLBLUE LIMITED continued Reviewing the returns on a quarterly basis, fund performance was positive consistently, with the strongest results in the third quarter as the majority of the underlying funds were profitable.
Whilst still positive, the first quarter delivered the lowest performance as the BlueTrend Alignment fund was negatively impacted by market reversals in March.
Over 2012, there were relatively modest adjustments to positioning as the Committee believed that, in an environment where predictions on strategy level performance were challenged by the dominance of political factors on markets, it would be prudent to maintain the portfolios allocations close to the long-run average.
The main allocation changes made were to increase BlueCrest Capital International, Multi-Strategy Credit and BlueMatrix and to reduce BlueTrend Alignment, Emerging Markets and Mercantile.
These allocation changes reflected shifts in the relative opportunity set available for the strategies through the year, as well as to recognise the higher expected risk-adjusted returns for BlueMatrix, following improvements to the model.
Throughout the course of the year the funds Value at Risk VaR Historic Simulation, 95% confidence, 1 day VaR has averaged 0.25%, with a low of 0.17% being seen in July and a high of 0.35% being observed in December.
The underlying funds continued to hold significant levels of unencumbered cash, with levels at year end ranging from 27% in BlueCrest Mercantile and BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit to 49% in BlueMatrix.
The imputed cash level for AllBlue was around 33%, in addition a number of the underlying funds utilise Alignment BlueCrests absolute return fixed income fund to manage a portion of what would otherwise be unencumbered cash: the fund look-through exposure to unencumbered cash plus Alignment was 67% at year-end.
A high level of diversification was seen between the underlying funds, with the average correlation being -3%.
The highest correlation in 2012, measured on weekly data, was between BlueCrest Capital International and BlueTrend Alignment 53.5%, whilst the lowest correlation was observed between BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit and BlueCrest Capital International -27.0%.

17 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER OF ALLBLUE LIMITED continued 2012 Key Performance Drivers by Fund BlueCrest Capital International The Rates team were the largest return driver, with gains seen across all of their sub-strategies: curve trading strategies made the greatest contribution to profits from all of the sub-strategies within Rates, with numerous trades across maturities and markets proving profitable through the risk on, risk off moves that led to changes in yield curve slopes and shapes.
Meanwhile, the Relative Value team delivered consistently good performance through the year from a diversified range of sub-strategies such as curve, bond basis and swap relative value, with both the European and North American markets providing a significant contribution to profits.
The positive return of Alignment for the year was achieved through a range of strategies, led by interest rates followed by Agency, Credit, Mortgage Backed and Inflation linked bond strategies.
The performance impact of other strategies was not significant, as more challenging markets reduced returns and the allocations made within the portfolio were modest in size.
BlueCrest Emerging Markets Strong performance in 2012 was driven by dynamic positioning through the markets risk on, risk off cycles, via a number of strategies including relative value and directional trading.
The most successful asset classes were local market interest rates, sovereign credit and FX, with the small risk allocation to corporate credit strategies adding modestly to returns.
Within local interest rate markets, positioning generally had a long bias through the year, as the portfolio anticipated lower rates in emerging markets as they sought to protect their economies from the slow down in developed markets.
The most successful regions were CEMEA, benefitting from improved sentiment in the Eurozone in the latter part of the year, along with Latin America.
Asia and developed markets in strategies linked to emerging markets, also generated positive returns.
BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit The portfolio started 2012 with defensive positioning based on a cautionary outlook for credit given broader market risks.
As markets rallied, performance in the first quarter was modest with short positions partially detracting from gains.
In the second quarter, the increased volatility within markets played to the strength of the teams trading capabilities and profits were generated from several relative value strategies in the US and Europe.
In the US, high yield and corporate credit indices were profitable, whereas in Europe, shorts in investment grade corporates benefitted from the weakening economy.
Markets continued to offer attractive trading opportunities through the second half of the year and the funds positioning moved more positive, taking a long-bias in US credit.
Areas of particular success include asset backed securities and US high yield indices, which benefitted from improved sentiment after the US Federal Reserves QE3 actions.
18 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER OF ALLBLUE LIMITED continued BlueCrest Mercantile Over 2012, the two main credit sub-strategies, Bank Basel II and Trade Credit Opportunities, produced positive returns whereas the Commodities Finance sub-strategy delivered a modestly negative return.
Within the Bank Basel II sub-strategy, performance of the underlying portfolios remained positive throughout the year as overall default rates in the portfolios assets continued to be very low.
The Trade Credit opportunities portfolio also performed well, as good sector selection and the identification of and access to cheap assets led to solid net positive carry, less the cost of hedges.
The portfolio maintained defensive positioning through holding shorter duration assets, in anticipation of better entry points for longer maturity assets in due course.
The Commodity Finance sub-strategy performed well in the first quarter after a profitable position sale, but gains were partially offset later in the year by losses on gold-related assets.
BlueTrend Alignment The environment for trend following remained challenging and the BlueTrend strategy was modestly positive for 2012: the lowest annual performance of the nine calendar years since inception.
However the positive contribution from the Alignment fund, used to invest a portion of the unencumbered cash holding, increased returns for the year.
Within BlueTrend, the best performing sectors were Short Interest Rates gaining approximately 5% gross, Bonds gaining approximately 3% gross and Equity gaining approximately 2% gross.
Conversely Metals, Energies, FX and Crops were negative performers losing approximately 3%, 2%, 2% and 1% respectively.
Margin to Equity for the fund ranged between 9.3% and 23.1% with an average of 15.0% measured on monthly data.
BlueCrests Systematic Trading Team continues to seek enhancements and additions to the underlying models of BlueTrend, with a number of research developments being released over the course of 2012.
BlueMatrix It was a challenging start to the year for statistical arbitrage strategies due to high single stock correlation rendering the models less effective.
On 1 October after extensive research work by the Systematic Trading Team it was decided to extend and enhance the signal set from which BlueMatrix seeks to generate its returns.
Previously the fund had a very narrow focus, leaving the strategy prone to whether the environment suited that specific signal set: since October the strategy combines several return sources based upon technical, fundamental and other signal styles.
In the fourth quarter, the performance of the enhanced model was mixed across regions and signals.
The European portfolio was the main contributor to performance with consistently positive returns: the US portfolio was also a positive contributor.
The Asian portfolio faced the most difficult conditions and detracted from the positive performance provided by the other regions.
