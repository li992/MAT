Group overview TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2012 5 Group overview Our new structure From the start of the new financial year, TUI Travel PLC will report in three sectors: Mainstream, Specialist & Activity and Accommodation & Destinations.
The businesses within our sectors follow either the Tour Operator or Online Accommodation business model depending on which market they address see How we do it: Business models.
As previously announced in April 2012, the Mainstream Sector will be reporting via key source markets instead of regionally.
The Emerging Markets Sector has been absorbed into other sectors depending on whether the specific business addresses the Tour Operator or Online Accommodation market.
The Accommodation & Destinations Sector divisions will now report through two business lines Online Accommodation and Inbound Services.
Online Accommodation includes the Accommodation Wholesaler and Accommodation OTA businesses.
Inbound Services include our businesses that provide transfers, excursions, tours, tailor-made products, cruise handling services and meetings and events.
This business line straddles both models as its businesses serve both individual travellers and tour operators.
