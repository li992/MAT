On adoption the interest cost and expected return on assets disclosed in the Income Statement for the defined benefit pension plan will be based on discount rate assumptions.
This is different from the IAS 19 standard used in these financial statements IAS revised 2008 which uses discount rates to set the interest cost, but a return on assets assumption to calculate the expected return on assets.
If IAS 19 revised 2011 had been used in the 2012 financial statements, the expected return on assets recognised in the Income Statement would have been 539,000 lower at 2,246,000.
The treatment of administrative and investment expenses under IAS 19 revised 2011 will also change.
If IAS 19 revised 2011 had been used for the 2012 financial statements the current service charge cost recognised in the Income Statement would have been 4,000 higher at 333,000.
The changes under IAS 19 revised 2011 described above have no impact on the post-retirement benefits liability that is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position.
