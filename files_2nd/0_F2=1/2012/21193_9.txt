Delta Lloyd On 6 May 2011, the Group sold 25 million shares in Delta Lloyd, reducing our holding at that date to 42.7% of Delta Lloyds ordinary share capital, representing 40% of shareholder voting rights.
As the Group no longer commanded a majority of shareholder voting rights, it no longer controlled Delta Lloyd.
Accordingly, from 6 May 2011, the Group ceased to consolidate the results and net assets of Delta Lloyd and its results up to that date were shown as discontinued operations.
