Directors report continued Charitable and political donations }ii i `iV ` Li` `iLi i`f] f] Auditors Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that as far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys Auditors are unaware.
In addition, each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys Auditors are aware of that information.
This conrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP were first appointed as Auditors to the Company in September 2005 and have expressed their willingness to continue as Auditors.
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as the Groups Auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Going concern The Group has significant expenditure commitments on its exploration and development portfolio within the next twelve months.
As highlighted in notes 20 and 21 to the consolidated Financial Statements, the Group meets these investment requirements through a $350 million senior reserves based lending facility, a $50 million bridge facility and a $100 million convertible bond, the principal terms of which are described in notes 20 and 21 to the consolidated Financial Statements.
In order to ensure it remains within the terms of these loan facilities, the Group regularly produces cash ow ii `viV `ii iv`vviiVi V`}]Li`]V }i in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups producing assets and delays to development iV iV` Vi vviVi L`iiiiiL i`i`} facility, but is partly managed by a 2013 hedging programme.
To optimise the development of the portfolio, or in the event there are unexpected adverse changes to the Groups cash ows, the Directors are confident that the Group could manage its financial affairs, including the securing of additional capacity under its iiiL i`i`}v V]v }ii] i V} ``ivi}vii V expenditure, so as to ensure that sufficient funding remains available for the next twelve months.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the above uncertainties, the Directors believe that the Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in economic assumptions, show that the Group will be able to meet all its contractual commitments and to operate within the level of its current lending facilities for the foreseeable future, being twelve months from the date of this report.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and accounts.
