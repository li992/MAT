5.4% 2011: 1,042 The divisions revenue reected a slower than expected build up in sales of the Groups noise and vibration products on a number of programmes, while funding delays impacted sales from the UK Scout and Warrior Capability Sustainment armoured vehicle programmes.
US budget constraints resulted in the delay of a UAV fuel cell order.
There was some continuing impact from the previously announced cancellation relating to a European military aircraft.
Underlying operating profit reected lower sales, offset by cost reductions and reduced investment spend as this division moves out of a development phase and starts to ramp up into a long production phase for its aerospace products.

Highlights of activities in the year that Strategy in action will underpin the divisions future performance included: 1.
Increasing the Groups portfolio establishment of a five-year agreement with Kongsberg for the CROWS3 remote of specialist capability areas vehicle weapon station for the US Army Ultras Precision Air & Land Systems business has developed a fuel tank inerting positions on Boeing 787 and Gulfstream system for passenger aircraft which addresses a growing market need arising from aircraft that will provide long-term the continual drive to improve ight safety.
Development was internally funded returns as new build programmes ramp through a Group-wide Audacity challenge.
These systems deliver oxygen depleted up to full-rate production air to partially empty fuel tanks to minimise the risk of explosion.
PALS has used its considerable pneumatic systems capabilities, originally developed for military award of a contract for a range of applications, to design a novel system architecture in partnership with leading equipment for the Embraers KC-390, industry suppliers.
Ultras solution meets regulatory safety requirements and at the reecting growing business with the same time addresses manufacturers and airlines needs for lighter, fuel efficient and worlds third largest aircraft manufacturer cost effective aircraft subsystems.
