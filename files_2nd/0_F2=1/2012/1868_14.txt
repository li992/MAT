Higher fuel prices increased revenue by 9.4% $15.3 million and the net impact of acquisitions and disposals contributed an additional $32.5 million of revenue.
On an organic basis Flight Support revenues decreased by 4%.
Of Return on invested capital this, 1% related to the general reduction in market activity in both business and general aviation B&GA and commercial aircraft movements together with the modest impact on both B&GA and commercial movements from Hurricane Sandy.
A further 1% related to weaker fide-icing and 2% was due to our exit early in the second half of 2011 from the Miami and Tampa FBOs.
This adversely impacted underlying operating profit for the division, which declined to $112.5 million 2011: $124.6 million and operating margins which reduced by 80 basis points to 8.5% 2011: 9.3% after adjusting fuel prices, with the benefit of continued operational improvement more than offset by the shortfall in high margin fide-icing activity.

Return on invested capital reduced by 120 basis points to 9.4% 2011: 10.6% reflecting the reduction in underlying operating profit.
