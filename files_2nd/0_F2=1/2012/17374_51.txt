How were doing Advertising agency networks Commarco Report by Christian Tiedemann Chief executive officer In 2012 the Commarco Group furthered its objective to become the leading creative communication network in German-speaking markets, with deepblue networks and United Visions both performing particularly well.
We also boosted our digital media capabilities by taking a majority stake in KKLD, a Berlin-based social media digital agency.
With our flagship creative brand, Scholz & Friends, we underlined the strategic vision behind WPPs acquisition of Commarco in 2011 to bring together the best of the German-speaking region with the best of WPP by introducing a key international account to more than 20 sister companies across Europe.
Through this initiative, Scholz & Friends is able tooffer its client customised solutions country by country, leading the brand centrally from the clients HQ in Germany, a model we hope to develop with other clients.
By merging Scholz & Friends in Dsseldorf with WPPs red cell agency, we now have three full-service locations in Germany Berlin, Dsseldorf and Hamburg.
