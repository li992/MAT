Despite this and the stretch targets set for the year by the Committee, the levels achieved for core Group operating profit and core Group profit before interest and tax were between threshold and target for 2012.
This reects strong sales growth in Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic, Japan excluding the adverse comparison of Cervarix with the prior year and our Consumer Healthcare business, adjusting for the disposal of the non-core OTC brands, as well as effective cost control and financial efficiencies.
R&D and Vaccines performance Targets for the year around pipeline growth and value were exceeded.
Since January 2012, six new products have been led for approval and Phase III data is expected on 14 new assets in the next two years, including nine new drugs vaccines.
Over the next three years, there is potential to launch 15 new assets and GSK is on track to deliver its target long-term rate of return on R&D spend of 14%.
The table below sets out the matters the Committee considered in respect of the individual objectives set for each Executive Director.
Personal CEO performance Sir Andrew showed strong leadership and resilience in a challenging operating environment, as conditions in Europe deteriorated, to secure at year on year sales excluding disposals of over the counter OTC products, with growth across Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic, Japan excluding Cervarix and the Consumer Healthcare business, adjusting for the disposal of the non-core OTC brands.
Positive cash generation from operations and disposal of non-core OTC products enabled 6.3 billion to be returned to shareholders dividends of 3.8 billion and shares repurchased of 2.5 billion.
The ongoing US Federal Government investigations with the US Department of Health & Human Services were concluded with the signing of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.
Sir Andrew strengthened the core business through acquisitions and investments, completing three significant transactions HGS, Shionogi and Theravance to increase GSKs share of key future growth assets.
During the year, Sir Andrew also continued to advance the Groups leadership position on corporate responsibility issues, including action to increase the transparency of our clinical research and to improve access to our medicines.
GSK was again ranked in first position in the prestigious Access to Medicines Index.
Sir Andrew recommended the appointments of successors to two key Corporate Executive Team roles and the Board subsequently approved the appointment of Roger Connor as the new President, Global Manufacturing & Supply and Christophe Weber, as the new President, Vaccines.
CFO One of Simon Dingemans main objectives for 2012 was to implement further Group-wide cost control and financial efficiencies.
These were delivered, contributing signicantly towards 2012 overall performance and enabling GSK to maintain its core earnings per share on a constant currency basis.
He also achieved reductions in our effective core tax rate to 24.4% 2011 25.9%, meeting our targeted rate of 25% two years ahead of expectations.
Simon drove the continued delivery of the Operational Excellence restructuring programme, which has delivered approximately 2.5 billion of annual savings and remains on track to deliver 2.8 billion of annual savings by 2014.
He also made good progress towards improving the Groups funding prole, with net finance expenses for the year broadly similar to 2011 at 729 million, despite an increase in net debt of 5 billion in 2012.
Chairman, Global R&D & Vaccines Dr Moncef Slaoui led R&D and Vaccines through a very successful year.
R&D exceeded the pipeline development and value targets for the year as detailed above.
He also designed and implemented, with effect from January 2013, a new integrated way of working between R&D and other parts of the business to create a strong, global product launch capability for GSKs pipeline of new medicines.
Moncef also worked closely with Christophe Weber, as he transitioned successfully into his new role as President, Vaccines.
