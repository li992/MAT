Our objective is to be the best insurance and retirement savings business for customers: providing simple, trusted, value for money propositions accessible through multiple channels.
Progress against strategic initiatives 2012 has been characterised by huge changes in the insurance industry which has been reflected in our insurance business.
Our strategy of Simplification is in line with the direction of regulation, which has removed complex commission structures, gender discrimination and tax cross subsidies.
By combining our uK life Pensions and investment lP&i uK business with our General insurance business, we have a single leadership team, a simpler, flatter structure and a lower cost base.
We have also transferred most of our operations to the Group Operations functions, where we expect scale economies and depth of expertise to yield further cost savings and improvements to customer service.
This simplified business model has already strengthened our position as a cost leader in the industry.
Our focus is on investing to build profit streams in areas where we have market scale and competitive advantage, leveraging Group synergies.
Roughly one third of new business income and the majority of our General insurance income comes from insurance sales home and life protection to retail bank customers, building on strong linkages to our banking and mortgage businesses under the lloyds TsB, Halifax and Bank of scotland brands.
The rest of our business is focused on retirement savings, both the provision of annuities and pensions sold externally through intermediary and direct channels under the iconic scottish Widows brand.
in 2012 we were the market leaders in corporate pensions.
Whilst we also have a strong stream of ongoing profits from our legacy back book, including 24 billion invested in our With Profits funds, we are streamlining and reshaping the business including exiting the offshore bonds market.
We see strong potential in the bancassurance channel.
Whilst we withdrew investment advisors following a review of the implications of RdR, we continue to maintain a strong advisor force within branches to service insurance needs of customers.
We have expanded our life insurance proposition with a new earnings protection product with simple application and claims processes.
We are investing to improve customer experience in our market leading home insurance business: for example, improving our claims function to settle claims faster and get customers back in their homes more quickly.
This will enable us to protect and grow the business, leverage sales opportunities linked to online banking services and make more effective use of the deep understanding we have of our customers.
We will use this experience to expand in other core customer insurance needs such as commercial insurance.
We are committed to strengthening our position in the growing retirement savings market.
in corporate pensions, strong activity in the run up to RdR resulted in 23 per cent growth, with auto-enrolment expected to drive further growth over the next 3 to 5 years.
in partnership with the Peoples Pension, we launched AssistMe, a technology tool that supports our customers in meeting their auto-enrolment obligations, complementing our existing corporate platform MyMoneyWorks.
in annuities, we are developing our propositions to compete more effectively in an increasingly open market.
We launched our enhanced annuities pilot in the last quarter of the year and expect this to be fully rolled out by mid 2013.
This is the first step in expanding our participation in the annuity market, supported by our investment strategy that saw us purchase over 1 billion of attractive, high yielding, long-dated assets to match long duration insurance liabilities.
looking forwards we see enormous potential to serve the retirement needs of our retail bank customers, many of whom may no longer be able to get independent financial advice at retirement.
We continue to focus on retention of customers within our legacy lP&i books, including opportunities to migrate customers with maturing products into new investment propositions.
These customers provide 34 per cent of our total underlying profit.
Whilst we have invested in the systems and processes to help independent Financial Advisers through RdR, we anticipate exits from the market and the direct channel will be increasingly important for the orphan customers created.
We are strengthening our balance sheet and achieving capital efficiencies, realising synergies between insurance and the rest of the Group.
Our business model positions us to maximise the capital benefits from risk diversification available under the proposed individual capital Assessment Plus regime and ultimately solvency ii.
Activities within insurance during 2012 contributed further to a total 5.3 billion mitigation of the potential impact of cRd iV within the Group since 2010 and enabled 1.4 billion of excess liquidity within insurance to be provided to the Group.
We have developed a deep understanding of the protection and savings needs of our customers through our annual Protection, Pension and savings reports.
The centre for the Modern Family, which aims to improve understanding of families needs in the uK, was launched in december 2011 as part of our commitment to better understanding our customers needs and Helping Britain Prosper.
The benefits of this insight are reflected in the strength of our customer propositions which have won several industry awards including: Best stakeholder Pension provider for the third year running at the Moneywise 2012 Pension Awards, Best Group Pension Provider in the corporate Adviser awards and Best Personal Pensions Provider in the Professional Adviser awards.

lP&i existing business profit reduced by 257 million to 380 million in 2012.
More than 200 million of this reduction is attributable to the subdued economic environment.
For lP&i insurance contracts, returns on existing business reflect long-term economic assumptions for these policies.
The subdued economic environment has resulted in the rate of return used in calculating the 2012 results being significantly lower than the comparable rate in the prior year and this was the main driver of the reduction in existing business profit.
Existing business profits in our European business were impacted by the non-recurrence of net positive prior year assumption changes.
lP&i total new business profit also decreased by 4 per cent to 318 million, primarily reflecting a 3 per cent reduction in PVnBP driven by lower bancassurance volumes, reflecting the impact of the economic environment on customers desire to invest and the decision to only offer investment advice for customers with savings above 100,000 ahead of RdR.
High volumes of corporate pension sales through the intermediary channel have partially offset this: however, this change in business mix has resulted in a slight decrease in EEV new business margin which remains strong at 3.8 per cent.
General insurance other income reduced by 98 million primarily reflecting the run-off of the PPi book and lower investment returns.
Home insurance income was broadly in line with last year and reflects the maturity and competitiveness of the market.
increased claims of 22 million, 6 per cent higher than the prior year, were mainly driven by adverse property claims following weather events that have impacted during the year, with 2012 being the second wettest year on record.
Weather related claims totalled 110 million which is 95 million higher than such claims in 2011.
This was partly offset by lower underlying home claims reflecting our improved claims management processes which improved customer experience and reduced average claims costs as well as lower claims as a result of the reduction in the size of the PPi book.
despite the impact of weather related claims our combined ratio remains strong at 72 per cent.
costs reduced by 8 per cent reflecting a continued strong focus on cost management across the business and the ongoing delivery of simplification cost saving initiatives.
The capital position of the insurance group remains robust.
The estimated insurance Groups directive iGd capital surplus was 3.7 billion 3.7 billion at 31 december 2011.
A dividend of 0.6 billion was paid to the Group further mitigating the potential impact of cRd iV on the Group.
