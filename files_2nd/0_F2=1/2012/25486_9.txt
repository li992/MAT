This stability was short lived, as the continuing sovereign debt crisis and instability in the Eurozone led to sharp falls in equity indices in August 2011.
A period of marked volatility followed as investors remained cautious and risk in the financial markets remained high.
These challenging conditions made the implementation of investment strategies difficult and transaction volumes were depressed as a result.
Whilst equity indices regained ground during the final quarter, the risk of further volatility remains high and the outlook is dependent upon the future developments in the wider economy and achieving a credible solution to the Eurozone crisis.

Developments UK and Europe Equity markets rose at the beginning of the financial year and the FTSE 100 exceeded the 6 000 mark during April 2011.
For the first four months of the financial year, the FTSE 100 fluctuated around the region of 5 950, however, markets suffered a severe setback in early August, with sharp falls which saw the FTSE 100 dropping below 5 000.
The period since then has witnessed some marked volatility, with substantial swings occurring on a day-to-day basis.
These conditions have made investment decisions particularly difficult, which had a significant adverse impact on transaction volume and commission income from September 2011 until mid-January 2012.
While significant risk has remained in the market, a period of relative calm in the final quarter of the financial year has seen the equity markets rising, with the FTSE 100 exceeding a level of 5 900 before falling back to end the financial year at 5 768 While some clients view lower level of indices as being an investment opportunity, net new funds attracted into portfolios from existing clients has been notably depressed during most of the financial year, reflecting perceived risks of further volatility Following Investecs acquisition of the Evolution Group plc on 22 December 2011 further information is provided on page 341, the process of integrating the Williams fide Bro business into the Wealth & Investment division commenced.
While the integration process is ongoing, Investec Wealth & Investment Limited and Williams fide Bro will continue to trade as separate entities.
The integration is expected to complete during the 2012 13 financial year Investec Wealth & Investment is in the process of expanding its offshore offering to clients, which will allow the business to exploit opportunities in the international and UK resident non-domiciled marketplace.
South Africa The strong second half performance helped drive annual revenue growth by a respectable 6.2% in Rand terms.
Growth in discretionary assets of 18.7% in Rand terms was satisfactory and was accompanied by an encouraging yield pick-up which points to an improvement in overall funds under management quality compared to last year.
Strategic objectives UK and Europe Successfully complete the integration of the Williams fide Bro business during the remainder of the 2012 13 financial year Expand our presence in the international marketplace through our offshore capability Achieve positive net organic growth in funds under management Achieve growth in additional services which support the core business of investment management.
70 Investec integrated annual report 2012 | Divisional review South Africa We will continue to grow by focusing on the key metrics at our disposal.
These include our breadth of leading domestic and offshore investment portfolios and services as well our depth of relationship with many of South Africas high net worth individuals and families In support of this objective we have invested in enhanced operational capacity and technological platforms, continued to attract and develop experienced and professional investment staff, built a sustainable and consistent investment process and leveraged off the synergies available by being a part of the Investec group.
Sustainability considerations Investec Wealth & Investment works in partnership with out-of-the-ordinary organisations that share our core values.
Through these partnerships our clients gain access to a range of interesting and diverse opportunities to appreciate, learn and enjoy.
The services provided by Investec Wealth & Investment assist clients to preserve and grow their wealth and to build and plan for their future financial security.
Investec Wealth & Investment in South Africa believe that there has been a fundamental shift in the demand for finite resources which places upward pressure on prices and which will potentially end an environment of cheap resources.
Identifying the opportunity for clients, we launched AgriCom-One in October 2011 which is a structured investment linked to the underlying performance of a basket of agricultural commodities which closely correlates to the UN Food and Agricultural food price index.
In the UK, we have sponsored the National Gardens Scheme since 1994 and have helped to raise more than 29 million for the charity which works with garden owners to welcome thousands of visitors around the UK into their gardens each year.
We sponsor the National Gardens Scheme Yellow Book which allows people to plan their visits and discover different gardens.
In South Africa, we support a variety of charities with some R592 000 donated to various causes including education, cancer and welfare of animals.
Looking forward UK and Europe The key focus of the new financial year will be to achieve the successful integration of the Williams fide Bro business into the Wealth & Investment division.
Several work streams are ongoing to manage the integration process and its related risks The future direction of equity markets continues to be uncertain.
Fee income remains exposed to the actual level of the markets on the key quarterly billing dates of the financial year The prospect of continuing significant day-to-day volatility in the UK equity markets may lead to depressed transaction activity, potentially adversely affecting the level of commission income generated We continue to seek to achieve net organic growth in funds under management of 5% per annum The conclusions and proposals of the Retail Distribution Review RDR continue to be debated.
The full impact that the RDR will have on the industry is yet to become apparent and we will continue to monitor developments closely over the course of the 2012 13 financial year as we progress towards the full implementation of the RDR within the industry The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS raised a substantial levy on the investment management industry in the previous financial year as a result of the failure of an investment firm, Keydata.
The FSCS has raised the possibility that the recent failure of MF Global may result in compensation being paid by the FSCS to the extent that further levies may be warranted.
The FSCS has been unable to quantify the risk or extent of such further levies until more information regarding the losses and the likely number of eligible claimants becomes available.
South Africa Market volatility, as measured by the Volatility Index VIX, is at one of its lowest levels in the five years since the financial crisis first began.
This generally bodes well for our discretionary investment management business as investors are inclined to allocate a larger portion of their investable assets into riskier asset classes, including equities The side effects of long-term low market volatility include lower trading-related turnover which can have a negative impact on our advisory and execution stock broking businesses revenue.
This, together with increased margin pressures and rising regulatory related costs throughout the private client stock broking industry, may result in a reduced contribution to overall income from this segment of the business for the new financial year We continue to focus on acquiring new discretionary and other annuity fee paying type assets which best fit into our core investment infrastructure an area in which we have invested quite considerably over the past year.
In addition to this, we expect to consolidate our international investment service offering via a single, seamless platform.
