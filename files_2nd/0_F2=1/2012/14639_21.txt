3 Other elements of our remuneration policy In addition, the Company has guidelines for Executive Directors with respect to share ownership requirements and external directorships.
Following appointment to the Board, Executive Directors are expected to accumulate a shareholding worth 100% of salary in the Company.
It is expected that on vesting all PSP shares net of tax will be retained until the required shareholding is achieved and that this level of shareholding should be retained for the duration of the appointment.
The Committee can exercise discretion in implementing this policy where personal circumstances make it appropriate to do so.
For details of Directors shareholdings please see pages 73 and 74 of this Remuneration Report.
Directors are permitted to hold external directorships.
None of the Executive Directors hold a directorship on a FTSE 100 company.
In line with this policy, Mr Vernon served as a Non-Executive Director at Senior plc during the year, for which he received and retained total fees of 39,240.
On 25th February 2013 Mr Vernon became a Non-Executive Director of Liqtech International, Inc.
When appointing external hires into executive roles, the Committee will continue to act in the best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 63 Remuneration report continued 2.2 Total remuneration opportunity Under the remuneration policy, a signi cant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Companys performance.
Below we illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and below threshold.
In addition, for the three Executive Directors who served for the full 12 months of the 2012 financial year, the charts below show a comparison of forward looking policy with the actual remuneration for 2012 including and excluding share price appreciation in respect of the PSP element.
Participants do not accrue dividends over the performance period.

1 Executive Directors As noted in the Committee Chairmans opening letter, in 2012 Executive Directors service agreements were reviewed and brought into line with best practice following feedback from our shareholders.
On signing the revised service agreements, there were no payments made, nor were there changes to any other aspects of the Executive Directors pay to compensate for the lost rights.
The changes were as follows: Where a payment is made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity based on an average of the preceding three years bonus payments is now subject to the Companys discretion to reduce the amount to re ect performance on the part of the Executive Director which is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory.
Bonus payments, if any, will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into account individual performance in order to ensure that there will be no payments for failure.
In any event, any payments will also be subject to the clawback provisions in the rules.
Save as set out in the table below, the Company has discretion to make the termination payments in instalments and such instalments will be reduced to take account of required mitigation by the Executive Director.
While the Executive Directors service agreements continue to include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not.
The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for the Board of Directors and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors service agreements would have no in uence on the voting pattern of those Directors.
The service agreements for all Executive Directors can be terminated at 12 months notice by either party.
The table below sets out key provisions relating to termination of employment from the Executive Directors service agreements and from the incentive plan rules.
It also sets out key provisions relating to change of control.
Executive Directors service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct.
Service agreement and incentive plan provisions relating to termination Salary and bene ts Appointments can be terminated with immediate effect and, in lieu of the unexpired notice period, the Company can make a series of monthly payments in respect of salary, bene ts and pension provision or at the Companys discretion, a lump sum.
Any monthly payments would be reduced to take account of amounts received from alternative employment, in line with the mitigation provisions.
In addition, on termination Mr Vernon and Mr Whalen are entitled to relocation expenses in accordance with Company policy.
Annual bonus There is no automatic entitlement to accrued bonus on termination.
The Committee will exercise their discretion to determine whether any bonus is payable, taking into account individual performance.
No payment will be made in circumstances that amount to a payment for failure.
Amounts payable are subject to clawback provisions in the rules.
Performance Share Plan If an Executive Director ceases to be employed before the end of the three-year performance period, the relevant awards lapse except as noted below: - Awards made within six months of employment ceasing will always lapse.
- Where employment terminates due to death, disability, retirement or redundancy, each relevant award of shares vests subject to the performance condition measured at the earliest practicable date, pro-rated based on the time served during the performance period.
When notice is issued by the Company and is not for cause, the Committee applies the approach as described above, but has discretion to reduce the number of shares vesting to zero.
Employee Share Ownership Plan All appropriate shares shall be transferred as soon as practicable following cessation of employment.
Service agreement and incentive plan provisions relating to change in control Salary and bene ts In the event of termination following a change in control, the amount due as described above is payable in one lump sum.
Annual bonus Termination within 12 months following a change in control will result in the payment of a lump sum equal to the average of the last three years annual bonus or a shorter period if service as an Executive Director is less than three years.
Performance Share Plan Following a change in control, each relevant award of shares vests subject to the performance condition measured at the earliest practicable date, pro-rated based on the time served during the performance period.
Employee Share Ownership Plan All shares shall be transferred as soon as practicable following a change in control.
2 Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
Appointments may be terminated by the Company or individual with one months notice.
The appointment letters for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.

Whalen $386,000 N A The increases for Mr Vernon and Mr Meredith were similar to the average increase for UK employees for 2012 and also took into account market positioning, Company and individual performance and returns to shareholders over the period.
Mr Daws salary was reviewed with effect from 2012 to take into account the changes to his role effective in October 2011 when he became responsible for the UK and French Supply operations, in addition to the Asia Paci c steam specialties business.
While he relinquished responsibility for the Latin American steam specialties business, overall his role increased substantially and the Committee are of the view that his revised salary is appropriate for this increased scope of his role.
Mr Andersons and Mr Whalens salaries were set on appointment to the Board.
The following table sets out the 2012 fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.
Pay for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors does not vary with performance.

In spite of challenging times, 2012 was a good year for the Group which delivered earnings growth, maintained a strong operating pro t margin and increased dividends to shareholders.
Nonetheless, the annual bonus payments to Executive Directors were below target.
This re ects the stretching targets that the Committee determines each year for the Executive Directors, in order to incentivise above target performance.
The table below summarises the achieved performance in 2012 in respect of each of the measures used in the determination of annual bonus, together with an indication of actual performance relative to target.
