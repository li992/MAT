Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill is carried at cost less provision for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if any indicators of impairment arise.
For this purpose, management prepares a calculation of the recoverable amount of the asset.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
On 19 June 2007, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited, giving rise to a goodwill asset being recognised.
2012 2011 m m Goodwill 341.2 341.2 341.2 341.2 No additional goodwill was recognised in the year 2011: nil.
"The Group has determined that it has a single cash generating unit ""CGU"" for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill."
The recoverable amount for the acquired share capital was based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation using the Companys year end share price.
Intangible assets In 2007, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited.
This acquisition gave rise to the recognition of intangible assets relating to investment management contracts and trade name of the Group.
The other intangible assets relate to computer software.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The intangible assets currently recognised by the Group are its trade name, individual management contracts and software.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
In relation to the investment management contracts and the trade names, the useful lives are assessed as being nite and they are, therefore, amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for these assets are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The useful economic lives of the trade name and individual management contracts acquired are currently assessed as a maximum of ten years and seven years, respectively.
The remaining amortisation periods of the investment management contracts and trade names are 1.5 years and 4.5 years respectively.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with nite lives is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis.
Computer software licences acquired are capitalised at the cost incurred to bring the software into use and are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are estimated as being five years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs that do not meet the capitalisation criteria under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset.
The difference is then recognised in the income statement.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that an asset in use may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount at that time, then the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is measured as the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
The Directors have reviewed the intangible assets as at 31 December 2012 and have concluded there are no indicators of impairment.
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 75 Section 3: Assets and liabilities Notes to the Group financial statements Assets and liabilities continued 3.2.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they were incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of each asset over its estimated useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements Shorter of 10 years and the remaining period of the lease Ofce furniture and equipment 3-5 years The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial period end and adjusted if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benets are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item, is included in the income statement in the year the item is sold or retired.

"Financial instruments held at fair value Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of an instrument, at fair value adjusted for transaction costs, except for financial assets classied as at fair value through profit or loss ""FVTPL"" where transaction costs are immediately recognised in the income statement."
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ows from the assets have expired or where they have been transferred and the Group has also transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets The Groups financial assets include cash and short term deposits, trade and other receivables, quoted and unquoted seed capital investments and derivative financial instruments.
Financial assets are classied as at FVTPL as held for trading or designated at FVTPL, loans and receivables or available for sale.
The classication adopted by the Group depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired and is determined at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at FVTPL include investments in closed ended funds, open ended investment companies and unit trusts which are designated as fair value through profit or loss, as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the documented strategy.
A financial asset is classied in this category if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Financial assets at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other gains losses in the period in which they arise.
Assets in this category are classied as current assets.
Available for sale investments Available for sale investments are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classied in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management actively intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income until the security is disposed of or is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassied to the income statement for the accounting period.
Where a fall in the value of an equity investment is deemed to be significant or prolonged, this is considered an indication of impairment under IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
In such an event, the investment is written down to fair value and the amounts previously recognised in equity in respect of market value movement on the investment are recognised in the income statement as an impairment charge.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at FVTPL include derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedges and the minority interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries per the table below.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are carried at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other gains losses in the period in which they arise.
Where the Group holds more than 50 per cent.
of the share capital, the investment is classied as an investment in subsidiary.
Where the Group holds 20-50 per cent.
of the share capital, the investment is classied as an investment in associate.

Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Both are available for sale investments.
At 31 December 2012 and 2011, the Group held 9.68 per cent.
of the A ordinary shares in Cofunds.
During the year no A ordinary shares were disposed of 2011: none.
At 31 December 2012, the Group revalued the holding and a 5.5m loss 2011: 1.7m gain was recognised in other comprehensive income.
During 2011, the Group invested in iO Adria Limited, a company investing in Croatian property.
At year end, an impairment review was performed and a loss of 0.7m was taken to the consolidated income statement 2011: 0.6m loss recognised in other comprehensive income.
Calculation of fair value The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Where a quoted market price is not available, the Group establishes fair value using valuation techniques such as recent arms length market transactions, reference to current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis or other valuation models.
Investments in associates and financial assets at FVTPL These relate to seed capital investments in funds and investments made through subsidiary undertakings.
The fair value of quoted equity shares classied as Level 1 is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market.
Investments classied as Level 2 are units in unquoted investment funds.
The fair value of a funds unit is determined to be a proportion of the net asset value of the fund.
If there are significant liquidity discounts applied e. g. when the funds have redemption gates or lock-up periods, the effect of the adjustments will be to put the fair value in Level 3.
There are no such discounts applied at 31 December 2012 or 2011.
Available for sale The fair value is based on an internally calculated value of the entity.
This takes into account factors such as expected future cash ows or the net assets of the investment.
Liquidity discounts are included where considered relevant.

Financial instruments held at fair value continued Derivative financial instruments The Group does not trade in derivatives.
Derivatives are held to hedge specic exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the price to exit the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value are included in the income statement.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet under the heading of financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as dened in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in the fair value are taken to the income statement within finance expense.
The fair value is determined by discounting future cash ows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
Further information on the interest rate swaps is included in Note 1.9.
Total return swaps The Group has entered into five total return swap arrangements to hedge certain of its seed capital investments.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement within other losses in accordance with the fair value movements in the swap over the period of the contract and settled monthly in accordance with the terms of the contract.
At the balance sheet date, any cash settlement due from, or to, the counterparty is recorded within current assets or current liabilities as appropriate.
At 31 December 2012, the notional value of the swaps was 26.5m 2011: 32.5m.
The settlement amount at 31 December 2012 was 902,000 2011: 39,000 and is included within trade and other payables.

Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 79 Section 3: Assets and liabilities Notes to the Group financial statements Assets and liabilities continued 3.6.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against trade receivables and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables, including loans to employees, are included in current assets except where they have maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classied as non-current assets.
Accrued income is based on the latest available information and therefore involves a degree of estimation.

Collateral is pledged when the fair value of the swaps falls below certain pre-dened levels.
It is only returned to the Group when the liability reduces, subject to the same pre-dened levels as well as minimum repayment requirements.
This amount has been included within trade receivables in the note above.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally collected within four working days.
An analysis of the ageing prole of trade receivables is disclosed in Note 5.3.

Cash equivalents are short-term deposits which have an original maturity of 90 days or less.
Overdrafts are included within trade and other payables.
Cash at bank earns interest based at the current prevailing daily bank rates.
Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the forecast cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
The overdraft in 2011 arose during the ordinary course of business and relates to a settlement timing difference over the year end.
80 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Financial statements 3.8.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

The loan is secured by a charge over the assets of a subsidiary company, Jupiter Asset Management Group Limited.
The restrictions which arise under the terms of the loan facility prevent intercompany loans between certain subsidiaries and prohibit assets being sold, leased or disposed of other than in the ordinary course of business.
As shown below, the carrying value of the loan is disclosed net of unamortised debt issue costs which were capitalised on issue.

Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Certain share awards made to employees include conditions which, prior to vesting, may require the Group to repurchase the shares at nominal value.
Accordingly, these amounts are shown within trade and other payables.
Accruals are based on the latest information and, therefore, involve a degree of estimation.
The most significant accruals at the year end relate to bonuses.
The Group recognises a provision for bonuses based on a formula that takes into consideration the operating profitability of the Group.
At the end of each financial year, the Group recognises a liability for bonuses accrued but not yet paid in respect of service attributable to that year.
This provision is recognised within accrued expenses.
