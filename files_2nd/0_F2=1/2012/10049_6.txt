MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 BUSINESS REVIEW Market review 12 Meggitts portfolio of engineered products and services for extreme environments focuses on three core marketscivil aerospace 45% : military 39% : and energy and speciality products 16%.
This breadth and global reach enables us to offset negative conditions in individual sectors and regions.
Meggitt performed strongly in 2012 despite challenging market conditions, sustaining confidence in the groups robust business model and our ability to deliver average revenue growth of 6 to 7% per annum over the medium term.
With growing deliveries of new aircraft and increasing air trafc, we expect good growth in our civil aerospace markets in 2013.
Energy should also continue to be strong.
Military markets are more uncertain, with 61% of revenues coming from the US, where potential spending cuts are not dened.
Overall, conditions in our end markets would suggest mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2013.
