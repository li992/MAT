Continuation resolutions were passed for Sterling and Euro Share classes of Ordinary Shares at separate Class meetings held on 17 April 2013 and accordingly no further continuation vote can be triggered for each class until 31 December 2013 for the Sterling Share class and 31 January 2014 for the Euro Share class.
The Continuation resolution was not passed for the US Dollar Share class and therefore the Directors will formulate redemption proposals to be put to the shareholders of that class only offering to redeem their shares at the relevant Net Asset Value less the costs of all such redemptions.
