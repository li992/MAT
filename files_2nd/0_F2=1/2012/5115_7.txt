Business review easyJet plc 13 Annual report and accounts 2012 easyJet supports the work to make airspace more efficient through the Single European Sky initiative, and the European Commissions efforts to drive lower costs into airspace.
Europe now has a real opportunity to address the inefficiencies in airspace, and it is vital that individual Member States are not allowed to escape their responsibilities to deliver change and control costs.
easyJet remains concerned with the continual increase in taxes onaviation across Europe, which is undermining European growth and ultimately jobs.
easyJet has undertaken work to demonstrate togovernments that these taxes are not in their interest or those ofconsumers or people working within the sector.

easyJet is focused on ensuring that the reform brings clarity to airline obligations.
easyJet believes in the importance of providing passengers with the right level of protection, but also the protection passengers value and want to pay for.
The airports easyJet ies to are central to its business model.

easyJet has focused aller simple, taxes incluses onensuring that there is effective regulation where it is needed, but also that regulators understand the needs of point-to-point airlines 39 and their passengers.
There is cost pressure from regulated airports across Europe from a combination of lower passenger volumes, restricted access to finance and upcoming regulatory reviews.
Thecost increases from the regulatory reviews in Spain and Italy were disappointing for easyJet and there are upcoming reviews at Gatwick, Geneva and Stansted.
To address the risk of increasing Example only.
airport costs, easyJet has put in place a more sophisticated approach to regulated airport charges building on experience ofworking with governments and economic regulators.
This has involved developing economic evidence on the impact of airport charges, providing technical input into regulatory reviews and ensuring that easyJet is properly represented in discussions with regulators and governments.
At non-regulated airports, easyJet has worked where possible toputin place long-term contracts that mitigate the risk of future cost increases and ensure that easyJet can build on a long-term sustainable platform.
Strategic progress: easyJet is uniquely positioned to bethe structural winner in European short-haul aviation easyJet is structurally positioned as the strongest pan European airline due to its cost advantage, leading market positions at convenient airports and great customer proposition of low fares with friendly and efficient service supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in European aviation.
As inefficient and nancially weak competitors retrench, easyJet will continue its strategy to build its leading position on Europes top 100 routes where it has a 25% market share to become the leading point-to-point airline ying between primary airports.

As a consequence of the desire to re-orientate the easyJet network to drive sustainable long-term returns, easyJet took the difficult step of announcing the proposed closure of its Madrid base from winter 2012 13. easyJet will continue to serve Madrid and the rest of Spain but to do so differently by moving its aircraft to other easyJet bases, which will deliver higher returns for the airline.
It was clear from the network review that the Madrid base was delivering returns, signicantly below all of easyJets other bases.
Thiswas due to a combination of overcapacity in the Spanish airlinemarket, leading to low revenue per passenger, combined with high airport charges, which have more than doubled in the last two years and will be subject to further increases above ination in the coming years.
Aircraft have been redeployed in areas which have the potential to drive higher returns, further evidenced by the strengthening of our position in Lyon and the opening of the French regional bases in Nice and Toulouse: the new Lisbon base: London Southend opening to improve the offering in north London and additional aircraft based in Gatwick, Basel and Milan with further plans to increase aircraft based in Edinburgh and Manchester.
Maintain cost advantage easyJet has a cost advantage over its competitors in the airports that it operates from, allowing it to offer competitive and affordable fares.
Its key competitors in these airports tend to be legacy carriers with older, less efficient aircraft, lower asset utilisation, lower seat densities and load factors and higher levels of xed costs.
This lower cost base enables easyJet to offer the lower fares its customers value.
