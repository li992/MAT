Financial statements Section 5: Other notes Notes to the Group financial statements Other 5.1.
Basis of preparation and other accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRIC Interpretations IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention modied by the revaluation of certain available for sale financial assets, financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value through the statement of comprehensive income and the income statement respectively.
After reviewing the Groups current plans and forecasts and nancing arrangements, as well as the current trading activities of the Group, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
Basis of accounting The consolidated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2012 includes the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012.
The accounting policies that follow set out those policies that have been applied consistently in preparing the financial statements, with no new policies adopted for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
"The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed later in this note within the section titled ""Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions""."
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
A list of principal subsidiaries can be seen in Note 6.3.
Uniform accounting policies are applied across all Group companies and intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Seed capital investments in closed-ended funds, open-ended investment companies and unit trusts are accounted for as subsidiaries, associates or other financial investments depending on the holdings of the Group and on the level of influence and control that the Group exercises.
The transactions and balances of subsidiaries are consolidated in these financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
When the Group holds controlling interests in certain mutual funds and similar entities, these are accounted for as subsidiaries.
The funds have issued redeemable shares to the Group and external investors who have the ability to put the redeemable shares back to the funds.
In accordance with IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation, noncontrolling interests in redeemable shares issued by these funds accounted for as subsidiaries represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the Group or its subsidiaries and are included within other gains losses in the income statement and as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the balance sheet.
This is due to the ability of the external shareholders in these funds to put the shares back to the funds.
ii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies and are usually accompanied with a shareholding between 20 per cent.
Investments that are held as part of the Groups investment portfolio in mutual funds and similar entities are carried in the balance sheet at fair value even though the Group may have significant influence over those companies as permitted by IAS 28, Investment in Associates, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The fair value of investments in associates is determined by reference to the quoted bid prices or net asset value of the underlying investments at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The Group has no investment in associates other than these and, therefore, no associates are currently equity accounted.

Basis of preparation and other accounting policies continued Foreign currency i Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial information of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is both the Companys functional and presentational currency as well as the currency in which the majority of the Groups revenue streams, assets and liabilities are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of other gains losses.
Translation differences on non-financial assets, such as investments classied as available for sale, are included in other comprehensive income unless the change in the fair value taken to equity has been recycled to the income statement, in which case the foreign exchange gain or loss is also recycled to the income statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each consolidated income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income.

Basis of preparation and other accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations adopted for 2012 There were no new standards during the year which had a material impact on the Group.
The Group has continued to apply the accounting policies used for its 2011 financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS Interpretations Committee have issued a number of new accounting standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations.
The following new standards are not applicable to these financial statements, but are expected to have an impact when they become effective.

IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Prescribes the accounting for investments in associates 1 January 2014 and sets out the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures.
Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments These amendments clarify some of the requirements 1 January 2014 for offsetting financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
The Group is assessing the impact of the above standards on the Groups future financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of the financial information requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If, in the future, such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial information, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modied as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group financial statements are discussed in the following notes.

Financial risk management continued Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is subject to a number of financial risks throughout its business, the principal risks being market risk, including price, foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board is accountable for risk and is responsible for oversight of the risk management process.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the risk strategy of the Group, and for determining an appropriate risk appetite and tolerance levels within which the Group must operate.
By dening these, the Board demonstrates that it is aware of and, where appropriate, has taken steps to mitigate the impact of risks that may have a material impact on the Group.
The Executive Committee reviews the key corporate risks facing the Group.
The Chief Financial officer has responsibility for the risk and control framework within the Group and the independent monitoring and reporting of risk and controls.
The Chief Financial officer through a Risk Committee manages the ongoing development of the Groups risk and control framework.
Jupiter embeds risk management within the business, with independent oversight and challenge being provided by the risk function.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets will adversely impact the profitability of the Group.
Management has identied price risk as the exposure in the value of financial assets held by the Group, resulting in a loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The Group holds equity investments in its seed capital portfolio and is exposed to the risk of changes in the equity markets that will reduce the value of the Groups investments.
At 31 December 2012, the exposure to unlisted equity securities at fair value was 19.1m 2011: 24.6m and the exposure to listed securities at fair value was 53.8m 2011: 39.1m.
The Groups policy is to hedge the equity market and currency exposure of its seed capital investments depending on the fund mandate and whether available transactions are cost effective.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had a total return swap arrangement over certain of its holdings in seed fund investments.
A fall in value of an available for sale investment which is significant or prolonged is considered to be an indication of impairment under IAS 39.
In such an event, the available for sale investment is written down to fair value and the amounts previously recognised equity in respect of market value are recognised in the consolidated income statement as an impairment charge.
Price risk sensitivity analysis on financial assets The Directors believe that 10 per cent.
gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to price risk.
An increase or decrease of 10 per cent.
in equity markets would have the following impact on the profit before taxation and equity of the Group: 2012 2011 Market value movement 10 per cent.
m m Income statement 2.7 0.7 Equity 1.9 2.5 The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
As the Group predominantly operates in the UK, with some transactions from overseas third parties in foreign currencies, this then impacts its exposure to non-sterling income and expenses.
The Groups policy is to hold minimum currency to cover operational needs and, therefore, to convert foreign currency on receipt.
Direct exposures are limited to operational cash held in overseas subsidiaries and short term outstanding currency fee debts at any time.
The Group does not normally hedge this risk.
Foreign currency risk is managed by the finance function incorporating treasury operations, whereby foreign currency balances are monitored closely.
90 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Financial statements 5.3.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from the fair value or future cash ow of adverse movements in interest bearing assets and liabilities and so reduce profitability.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long term debt obligations with oating interest rates Note 1.9.
Cash held by the operating companies is held at xed rates for no longer than three months.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a combination of xed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
As explained further in Note 1.9, the Group has entered into swap arrangements to effectively x the rate payable on a portion of its variable debt.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
In such circumstances, the Group raises long term borrowings at oating rates and swaps them into xed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at xed rates directly.
At 31 December 2012, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 90 per cent.
of the Groups borrowings are at a xed rate of interest 2011: 49 per cent..
The Group is also exposed to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
The Groups finance function monitors the Groups interest rate cash ow risks and returns.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The Directors believe that a movement in interest rates of 50bps gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to interest rate risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax mainly through the impact on oating rate borrowings.
There is only an immaterial impact on the Groups equity.
2012 2011 Impact on the income statement of change in interest rates m m 50 bps 0.7 0.3 -50 bps 0.5 0.3 The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements and takes into account the economic cash ow impact.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to a financial loss in its operating activities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily on its trade receivables and from its nancing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments.
Fee receivables arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignicant and the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets Notes 3.6 and 3.7.
"The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December is shown below: 2012 2011 m m Derivative financial instruments Trade and other receivables Note 3.6 65.8 57.4 Cash and cash equivalents Note 3.7 147.0 151.3 212.8 208.7 With regard to credit risk related to financial instruments, the Groups policy is to place deposits only with financial institutions which satisfy minimum ratings and other criteria set by the Counterparty Review Group ""CRG""."
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and, therefore, mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The CRG monitors the Groups counterparty exposures.

Trade and other receivables which are not rated comprise fees receivable for fund management services.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due or at a signicantly higher cost.
The Group produces a cash ow forecast to ensure all assets and liabilities are managed efficiently.
The Groups objectives are: ensuring both the Group as a whole and individual entities within the Group have access to sufficient liquid funds to trade solvently and meet trading liabilities as they fall due: allowing the Group to maintain a exible dividend policy, taking reference to prior year and prospective profitability, cash ow and balance sheet: and providing the Group with appropriate exibility over the transferability of its capital and cash balances.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balances required for working capital management is held in interest bearing deposits of up to 90 days and the regulated companies, in particular, ensure that sufficient capital is kept to meet regulatory requirements.

The subsidiaries within the Group which are regulated are required to maintain capital resources to comply with the regulatory capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority and other global financial regulators.
All regulated entities within the Group complied with the externally imposed regulatory capital requirement.
Headroom over regulatory capital is discussed at Balance Sheet Management Committee.
Further information on the Balance Sheet Management Committee can be found in the Risk management and controls report within the Governance section.
In addition to the capital held to meet the regulatory capital requirements, the Group maintains sufficient cash resources to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due, taking into account cash forecasts.
The Group performs regular cash ow forecasts, modelling both normal and stressed conditions.
Liquidity risk is mitigated by the long term nature of the Groups principal borrowings and the high levels of cash balances in the business.
