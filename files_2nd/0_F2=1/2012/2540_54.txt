Incentive plans The committee seeks to ensure that variable pay is determined by relevant and stretching measures of performance that are consistent with the strategic objectives and risk prole of the Company, in order to appropriately align directors interests with those of shareholders and to engender appropriate risk-based behaviour.
In setting incentive levels, the committee considers mid-market data on short and long-term incentive opportunity from a peer group of both general industry and appropriate consumer goods retail sector companies.
Short-term incentive plan In 2011 12, targets were approved by the committee at the beginning of the year and were aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives.
Target Maximum Performance metrics Chief executive 70% 140% Target bonus is payable for achievement of target PBT, net revenue growth and free cash ow performance.
Group finance director 60% 120% Maximum bonus is payable for the achievement of exceptional performance targets.
For 2011 12, a bonus of 0% of salary was earned by both the chief executive and the group finance director as performance was below the committees stretching performance targets.
The committee has decided to maintain the same target and maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors in 2012 13.
The committee has also decided that the key short-term operational drivers of the business for 2012 13 remain appropriate, but that a greater weighting should be applied to free cash ow.
The amended bonus structure for 2012 13 will be paid for achievement of performance targets based on PBT unchanged at 50% of total bonus, net revenue growth reduced from 25% of total bonus to 20% and free cash ow increased from 25% of total bonus to 30% and will be set at appropriately stretching levels.
This weighting was considered appropriate by the committee to give a greater emphasis on cash ow management whilst maintaining a focus building brand strength and profit growth.
