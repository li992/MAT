Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2012 0101 Modification to the Return This return has been prepared in accordance with the Accounts and Statements Rules, as modified by a direction made by the FSA in December 2011 under section 148 of the Act.
The effect of the direction is to enable Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc to provide a Group return in respect of the companies listed on page 160, such companies being required to maintain appropriate reinsurance arrangements and deeds of indemnity with RSAI.
0103 Company solvency statements Forms 1, 3, 11 and 12 for each of the companies included in the Group return are shown on pages 161 to 171.
0112 UK Group restructuring On 1 January 2012, following approvals by a UK court, a number of Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc RSAI s UK subsidiaries and a former UK subsidiary company completed the transfer of their insurance technical provisions and any remaining rights and obligations under insurance contracts to RSAI together with other related assets and liabilities which have been included in this return.
In addition, RSAI entered into reinsurance arrangements with certain subsidiaries to cover the existing and future insurance liabilities of their businesses.
The objective of the restructuring of the business of RSAI and its subsidiary companies was to rationalise the Group structure through a reduction of the number of authorised UK insurance companies within the Group.

e Uncertainties and contingencies The uncertainty arising under insurance contracts may be characterised under a number of specific headings, such as: uncertainty as to whether an event has occurred which would give rise to a policyholder suffering an insured loss: uncertainty as to the extent of policy coverage and limits applicable: uncertainty as to the amount of insured loss suffered by a policyholder as a result of the event occurring: and uncertainty over the timing of a settlement to a policyholder for a loss suffered.
The degree of uncertainty will vary by policy class according to the characteristics of the insured risks and the cost of a claim will be determined by the actual loss suffered by the policyholder.
144 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2012 There may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the Group.
Following the identification and notification of an insured loss, there may still be uncertainty as to the magnitude and timing of the settlement of the claim.
There are many factors that will determine the level of uncertainty such as inflation, inconsistent judicial interpretations and court judgments that broaden policy coverage beyond the intent of the original insurance, legislative changes and claims handling procedures.
The establishment of insurance liabilities is an inherently uncertain process and, as a consequence of this uncertainty, the eventual cost of settlement of outstanding claims and unexpired risks can vary substantially from the initial estimates, particularly for the Groups long tail lines of business.
The Group seeks to provide appropriate levels of claims provision and provision for unexpired risks taking the known facts and experience into account.
The Group has exposures to risks in each class of business within each operating segment that may develop and that could have a material impact upon the Groups financial position.
The geographic and insurance risk diversity within the Groups portfolio of issued insurance policies make it not possible to predict whether material development will occur and, if it does occur, the location and the timing of such an occurrence.
The estimation of insurance contract liabilities involves the use of judgments and assumptions that are specific to the insurance risks within each territory and the particular type of insurance risk covered.
The diversity of the insurance risks results in it not being possible to identify individual judgments and assumptions that are more likely than others to have a material impact on the future development of the insurance contract liabilities.
The sections below identify a number of specific risks relating to asbestos and environmental claims.
There may be other classes of risk which could develop in the future and that could have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
The Group evaluates the concentration of exposures to individual and cumulative insurance risk and establishes its reinsurance policy to reduce such exposure to levels acceptable to the Group.
Asbestos and environmental claims The estimation of the provisions for the ultimate cost of claims for asbestos and environmental pollution is subject to a range of uncertainties that is generally greater than those encountered for other classes of insurance business.
As a result it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims, particularly in periods when theories of law are in flux.
Consequently, traditional techniques for estimating claims provisions cannot wholly be relied upon and the Group employs specialised techniques to determine provisions using the extensive knowledge of both internal asbestos and environmental pollution experts and external legal and professional advisors.
Factors contributing to this higher degree of uncertainty include: the long delay in reporting claims from the date of exposure for example, cases of mesothelioma can have a latent period of up to 40 years.
This makes estimating the ultimate number of claims the Group will receive particularly difficult: issues of allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and insurers: emerging court decisions and the possibility of retrospective legislative changes increasing or decreasing insurer liability: the tendency for social trends and factors to influence court awards: developments pertaining to the Groups ability to recover reinsurance for claims of this nature: and for US liabilities from the Groups London market business, developments in the tactics of US plaintiff lawyers and court decisions and awards.
145 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2012 Potential change in discount rate for lump sum damages awards Legislative changes may affect the Groups liability in respect of unsettled claims in the use of predetermined factors used by courts to calculate compensation claims.
For example, in the UK, standard formulae are used as an actuarial measure by the courts to assess lump sum damages awards for future losses typically loss of earnings arising from personal injuries and fatal accidents.
The calibration of these standard formulae can be updated by the UK Government and the Lord Chancellor is currently reviewing the discount rate to be applied in determining the appropriate settlements.
A reduction in the prescribed discount rate would increase the value of future claims settlements.
Acquisitions and disposals The Group makes acquisitions and disposals of businesses as part of its normal operations.
All acquisitions are made after due diligence, which will include, amongst other matters, assessment of the adequacy of claims reserves, assessment of the recoverability of reinsurance balances, inquiries with regard to outstanding litigation and inquiries of local regulators and taxation authorities.
Consideration is also given to potential costs, risks and issues in relation to the integration of any proposed acquisitions with existing RSA operations.
The Group will seek to receive the benefit of appropriate contractual representations and warranties in connection with any acquisition and, where necessary, additional indemnifications in relation to specific risks although there can be no guarantee that these processes and any such protection will be adequate in all circumstances.
The Group may also provide relevant representations, warranties and indemnities to counterparties on any disposal.
While such representations, warranties and indemnities are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying purpose for the transaction.
These clauses are customary in such contracts and may from time to time lead to us receiving claims from counterparties.
Contracts with third parties The Group enters into joint ventures, outsourcing contracts and distribution arrangements with third parties in the normal course of its business and is reliant upon those third parties being willing and able to perform their obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts.
Litigation, disputes and investigations The Group, in common with the insurance industry in general, is subject to litigation, mediation and arbitration, and regulatory, governmental and other sectoral inquiries and investigations in the normal course of its business.
The directors do not believe that any current mediation, arbitration, regulatory, governmental or sectoral inquiries and investigations and pending or threatened litigation or dispute will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position, although there can be no assurance that losses or financial penalties resulting from any current mediation, arbitration, regulatory, governmental or sectoral inquiries and investigations and pending or threatened litigation or dispute will not materially affect the Groups financial position or cash flows for any period.
Reinsurance The Group is exposed to disputes on, and defects in, contracts with its reinsurers and the possibility of default by its reinsurers.
The Group is also exposed to the credit risk assumed in fronting arrangements and to potential reinsurance capacity constraints.
In selecting the reinsurers with whom the Group conducts business its strategy is to seek reinsurers with the best combination of financial strength, price and capacity.
The Group Corporate Centre publishes internally a list of authorised reinsurers who pass the Groups selection process and which its operations may use for new transactions.
146 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2012 The Group monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers, including those to whom risks are no longer ceded.
Allowance is made in the financial position for non recoverability due to reinsurer default by providing, in line with Group standards, having regard to companies on the Groups Watch List.
The Watch List is the list of companies whom the RSAIGs directors believe will not be able to pay amounts due in full.
Investment risk The Group is exposed to market risk and credit risk on its invested assets.
Market risk includes the risk of potential losses from adverse movements in market rates and prices including interest rates, equity prices, property prices and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Groups exposure to market risks is controlled by the setting of investment limits in line with the RSA Insurance Groups risk appetite.
From time to time the Group also makes use of derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity markets.
The Group has strict controls over the use of derivative instruments.
Credit risk includes the non performance of contractual payment obligations on invested assets and adverse changes in the credit worthiness of invested assets including exposures to issuers or counterparties for bonds, equities, deposits and derivatives.
Limits are set at both a portfolio and counterparty level based on likelihood of default to manage the RSA Insurance Groups overall credit profile and specific concentrations within risk appetite.
The Groups insurance investment portfolios are concentrated in listed securities with very low levels of exposure to assets without quoted market prices.
The Company uses model based analysis to verify asset values when market values are not readily available.
The current economic crisis adds further uncertainty and volatility to underlying levels of market and credit risk in the Eurozone.
The Company has, however, very limited direct exposure via its investment portfolio to the Eurozone and to the peripheral Eurozone countries in particular.
As with all other invested assets, limits are set in line with the Groups risk appetite.
The Company continues to monitor the situation closely and take action to manage its exposure as required.
Rating environment The ability of the Group to write certain types of insurance business is dependent on the maintenance of the appropriate credit ratings from the rating agencies.
The RSA Insurance Group has the objective of maintaining single A ratings.
At 31 December 2012 the ratings are A negative outlook from S&P and A2 stable outlook from Moodys.
In February 2012 S&P upgraded the Groups credit rating to A stable outlook.
Any worsening in the ratings could have an adverse impact on the ability of the RSA Insurance Group and the Group to write certain types of general insurance business.
In assessing credit risk in relation to reinsurance and investments, the RSA Insurance Group takes into account a variety of factors, including credit rating.
If any such rating changes, or is otherwise reassessed, this has potential implications for the related exposures.
Changes in foreign exchange rates may impact the Groups results The Group publishes financial statements in Pounds Sterling.
Therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates used to translate other currencies, particularly other European currencies and the Canadian dollar, into Pounds Sterling will impact the reported financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from period to period.
These fluctuations in exchange rates will also impact the Pound Sterling value of and the return on the Groups investments.
147 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2012 Income and expenses for each profit & loss account item are translated at average exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities, as reported in the balance sheet, are translated at the closing exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.
Regulatory environment The legal, regulatory and accounting environment is subject to significant change in many of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, including developments in response to changes in the economic and political environment and the recent financial crisis.
The Group continues to monitor the developments and react accordingly.
The new solvency framework for insurers being developed by the EU, referred to as Solvency II, is intended in the medium term to achieve greater harmonisation of approach across EU member states to assessing capital resources and requirements.
There remains continued uncertainty as delays in agreeing the rules have caused the planned implementation date of 2014 to be delayed.
The Company is actively participating in shaping the outcome through its involvement with European and UK regulators and industry bodies, whilst appropriately progressing its implementation plans and the directors are confident that the Company will continue to meet all future regulatory capital requirements.
1507 Details of other adjustments to liabilities The amount included in Form 15 line 83 represents the restriction of pension liabilities.
1601 Basis of conversion of foreign currency Foreign currency revenues are translated into Pound Sterling using the cumulative average rate for the financial year.
Adjustments have been made to the general business technical reserves arising from translation from year end rates.
1602 Restatement of amounts arising from currency conversion Some of the brought forward amounts shown in Forms 11,12, 21 to 24, 28, 31, 32 and 34 have been restated from the corresponding carried forward amounts included in the previous years return due to the conversion of foreign currency amounts at different rates of exchange.

1701 Variation margin There has been no excess variation margin received due to market movements that has subsequently been partly or wholly reversed.
There is no excess variation margin included in Form 13.

The method of allocation has been based on either, an allocation of case estimates or using policy section types.
The reasoning for the allocation decision is that the business covers multiple risks that are not rated on a single package basis.
20Ab Risks of Death or Injury to Passengers Contracts of insurance against risks of death of, or injury to, passengers have been allocated to the risk categories of private motor comprehensive, private motor non-comprehensive, motor cycle, fleets, commercial vehicles and yacht.

This has arisen due to foreign currency revenue items being translated into sterling using the cumulative average rate for the financial year and foreign currency balance sheet items being translated using year end rates.
2005 Other technical income or charges The amount shown for the other technical income and charges relates to Engineering Inspection income which is ancillary to the provision of Engineering insurance cover, and Risk Consultancy service income.
2007 Material connected-party transactions A number of reinsurance contracts are in place between the companies listed on page 160.
No individual contract is material and all are entered into on an arms length basis.
RSAI has contracts with other RSA Insurance Group Companies for which movements during the year represent the claims run off experience.
2102 Basis of calculation of provision for unearned premiums The provision for unearned premiums represents the proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of insurance subsequent to the balance sheet date, calculated principally on a daily pro-rata basis.
Both time apportionment and risk apportionment bases are used, the method depending on the fluctuation of the incidence of risk.
2103 Provision for unearned premium The provision for unearned premium, both gross and net, reported on lines 12 to 16 do not agree to balances reported in Forms 13 and 15 as a result of these balances being translated into sterling using the cumulative average rate when Forms 13 and 15 are translated using year end rates.
2202 Basis for determining claims management expenses Claims management expenses comprise the direct costs of managing and settling claims plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the claims function.
The provision for claims management costs carried forward represents the expected cost of managing outstanding claims from the balance sheet date until final settlement.
This provision is based on attributable expenses for the year and the number of claims outstanding.
Investment income is not included in the calculation of claims management costs carried forward.
2204 Basis for determining acquisition expenses Acquisition costs comprise all the direct costs of acquiring and retaining business plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the underwriting, sales and customer services functions.
Deferred acquisition costs are determined by applying average qualifying acquisition costs to the unearned element of premiums.
153 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2012 2302 Modification to Form 23 requirements The FSA, on application of the firms listed on page 160, issued a direction in December 2008, under section 148 of the Act.
The effect of the direction is that the amounts referred to in IPRU INS appendix 9.2 Paragraph 3 3 are expressed in sterling as if the conversion had taken place at the closing middle rate or the cumulative average rate pertaining to the financial year in which the amounts were transacted.
2402 Underwriting year accounting Aviation, marine and marine transport business written in the UK and the majority of treaty reinsurance business is reported on an underwriting year basis as this is how the underlying records and statistics are maintained.
Marine and transport business written by overseas branches, nonmarine transport business written in the UK and certain reinsurance treaty business is reported on an accident year basis.
Claims provisions for business reported on an underwriting year basis are determined using the annual method.
2404 Basis for determining claims management expenses Claims management expenses comprise the direct costs of managing and settling claims plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the claims function.
2406 Basis for determining acquisition expenses Acquisition costs comprise all the direct costs of acquiring and retaining business plus an attribution of indirect costs associated with the underwriting, sales and customer services functions.
Deferred acquisition costs are determined by applying average acquisition costs to the unearned element of premiums.
2501 Basis of calculation of provision for unearned premiums The provision for unearned premiums represents the proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of insurance subsequent to the balance sheet date, calculated principally on a daily pro-rata basis.
3001 Methods and assumptions used in determining the yield Yield is determined for securities with a redemption value as the rate of interest which, when used to obtain a present value of expected future income or capital payments give the current asset value.
For all other assets yield is calculated as the ratio of the income to value.
