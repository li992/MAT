Kevin Thompsons increase in accrued pension relates entirely to inflation as he ceased future service accrual in 2006. increase in directors value net of Transfer value contributions contributions Transfer value 2 April 2011 000 000 31 March 2012 Andrew Williams 497 15 179 691 Kevin Thompson 1,573 - 365 1,938 The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension plan.
The transfer values are Gilt related and depend upon the relative standings of the Gilt market at the respective valuation dates.
The increase in transfer values is predominantly due to the significant reduction in the yields available on UK Gilts over the year.
The fall in yields has been widely attributed to the Bank of Englands continued policy on Quantitative Easing and the Euro crisis.
Other factors that have increased the transfer values are the impact of any additional service, revaluation in line with inflation and any real salary increases as well as the anticipated ageing of the members.
These values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
