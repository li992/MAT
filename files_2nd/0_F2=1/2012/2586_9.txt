Under the terms of the acquisition of the Biocompatibles Group in January 2011, shareholders were entitled to receive 1.6733 new shares in the Company and either 10p cash or a Contingent Value Note CVN.
The CVN entitled the recipient to participate in value that potentially could have been achieved from Biocompatibles programme to develop a GLP-1 analogue product known as CM-3 in the area of diabetes, which it had partnered with AstraZeneca.
If that programme had been successful, the holder would have been entitled to receive the sterling equivalent of 0.56 in cash for each CVN held.
39 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors and governance Directors report The Company announced on 13 May 2011 that AstraZeneca had terminated the development and option agreement relating to CM-3.
As a result of AstraZenecas decision, the Company believes it is highly unlikely that any payment will be made in relation to the CVNs.
The payment obligation would only now arise if the Group entered into another form of licence, sale or other disposal of the CM-3 asset to the AstraZeneca Group prior to 31 December 2012.
In light of AstraZenecas decision to terminate the development and option agreement, the BTG Board does not believe that there is any realistic possibility that this will occur.
