Over 1,300 buses were secured in contract wins and we retained 97% of our existing contract base.
Conversion outsourcing contracts offer long term customer relationships and can deliver a better return on capital invested.
This year we won eight conversion contracts with 400 buses.
Net of contract losses, our overall organic volume growth was 800 buses for the 2012 13 school year.
In Charter, revenue grew by 9% in our existing business.
We are now seeking to grow Petermanns charter share, using the sales platform developed in the existing businesses.
Within less than a year of acquisition, the Transit operation achieved annualised revenue of $65 million in its three core sub-sectors: paratransit, shuttle and xed route contracts.
Our platform is based on existing paratransit contracts in the Petermann business, as well as two other small acquisitions completed in 2012.
Since integrating these businesses, we have won two further contracts, in Ohio and North Carolina, and our pipeline over the medium term has signi cant potential.
