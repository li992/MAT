outcomes of these matters, our experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar non-income tax matters, historical claims experience, actuarially determined estimates of liabilities and any related insurance coverages.
See Note 7 Costa Concordia, Note 8 Contingencies, Note 9 Income and Other Taxes and Note 11 Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our contingencies.
Given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we may have made with respect to their resolution.
In addition, as new information becomes available, we may need to reassess the amount of asset or liability that needs to be accrued related to our contingencies.
All such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
Results of Operations We earn substantially all of our cruise revenues from the following: sales of passenger cruise tickets and, in some cases, the sale of air and other transportation to and from airports near our ships home ports and cancellation fees.
The cruise ticket price includes accommodations, most meals, some non-alcoholic beverages and most onboard entertainment.
We also collect governmental fees and taxes from our guests, and sales of goods and services primarily onboard our ships not included in the cruise ticket price including, among other things, liquor and some non-alcoholic beverage sales, shore excursions, casino gaming, gift shop sales, photo sales, full service spas, communication services, cruise vacation protection programs and preand post-cruise land packages.
These goods and services are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee.
We incur cruise operating costs and expenses for the following: the costs of passenger cruise bookings, which represent costs that are directly associated with passenger cruise ticket revenues, and include travel agent commissions, air and other transportation related costs, governmental fees and taxes that vary with guest head counts and related credit card fees, onboard and other cruise costs, which represent costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues, and include among other things, the costs of liquor and some non-alcoholic beverages, costs of tangible goods sold by us in our gift shops and from our photo sales, communication costs, costs of cruise vacation protection programs, costs of preand post-cruise land packages and related credit card fees.
Concession revenues do not have significant associated expenses because the costs and services incurred for concession revenues are borne by our concessionaires, fuel costs, which include fuel delivery costs, payroll and related costs, which represent all costs related to our shipboard personnel, including deck and engine crew, including officers, and hotel and administrative employees, food costs, which include both our guest and crew food costs, and other ship operating costs, which include port costs that do not vary with guest head counts, repairs and maintenance, including minor improvements and dry-dock expenses, hotel costs, entertainment, freight and logistics and all other ship operating costs and expenses.
