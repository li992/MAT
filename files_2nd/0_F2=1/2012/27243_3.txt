Portfolio and Company performance Building on the solid start that your Company made in 2011, the Board remains pleased with the progress made by the Investment Manager.
The portfolio remains fully invested, with a strong US bias.
As at 31 December 2012, 93.91% of the Company was invested in US Dollar denominated assets, with 4.55% invested in euro denominated assets and 1.54% in cash.
The Investment Manager has constructed a diversified portfolio of loan investments.
At the end of the reporting period, the portfolio had 182 holdings across 147 issuers in 33 different sectors.
Between 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, the Companys NAV rose by 5.37% and 4.99% for the U. S. Dollar and Sterling series of Ordinary Share Class respectively.
The NAV returned plus dividends declared in the period was 10.60% and 10.23% for the U. S. Dollar Shares and Sterling Shares respectively.
As at 31 December 2012, the share price was trading at a premium of 1.93% for the USD and 0.78% for the GBP.
I am pleased to report that the share price traded at a premium to NAV for a large majority of the year.
During 2012, the dividend yield of the Company was 4.94% and 4.96% for the USD Ordinary Shares and GBP Ordinary Shares respectively, which is around the Companys 5% target range.
The Companys expectation is that, if market conditions and interest rates remain at their current levels, the annualised dividend will remain constant also.
Outlook for the rest of the financial year Looking to 2013, your Board continues to be satisfied with the portfolios performance to date and the strategy that is being applied by the Investment Manager.
The Investment Manager will continue to update you on the Companys progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and Investment Manager updates.
During the first quarter of 2013, the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately 363 million approximately $550 million by means of a Placing and Offer for Subscription of C Shares.
On 26 March 2013, 363,549,886 Sterling C Shares started trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
In accordance with the Companys Prospectus dated 19 February 2013, once the net proceeds of the C Shares are substantially fully invested, the C Shares will be converted into Ordinary Shares and subsequently admitted to the premium segment of the Official List together with the existing Ordinary Shares.
The conversion of the C Shares will be no later than 25 September 2013.
I would like to close by thanking you for your commitment and I look forward to updating you on the Companys progress later on this year.
Principal risks and related parties The Principal risks of the Company remain unchanged from last year and are largely highlighted on page 12 of these Financial Statements.
The Investment Manager's Report details their view on the current investment portfolio and their views on the investment pipeline and the wider developments and challenges in the loan market environment.
