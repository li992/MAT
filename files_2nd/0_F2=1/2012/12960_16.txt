In 2012, eight diamond holes totalling Loulo permit with gold deposits 2 960 metres were completed below the base of the US$1 500 oz resource pit shell.
The drilling confirmed the N geological model with all holes intersecting the targeted structure, but they also confirmed the highly variable nature of Baboto the mineralisation due to the coarse gold component.
Six holes returned narrow and weakly mineralised intersections.
Two holes Iron Hill from the programme returned high grade intersections at the southern end of the deposit: L3DH109 25.1 metres at 5.73g t P1 North from 272 metres: and L3DH111 14.1 metres at 3.48g t from 336 metres.
Gold mineralisation is hosted in medium to coarse grained greywacke which has been variably tourmalinised and associated with disseminated pyrite.
Further drilling will be undertaken pending a new pit optimisation and mining scheduling exercise.
Gara Gara South In December, work started on a new target at Gara South.
Lithosampling, trenching and RC drilling were completed in Loulo 3 the area between the Gara pit and the Falm River, some three kilometres of strike.
A trench excavated during the Gara South fourth quarter intersected 13 metres at 5.46g t from a pink Gara quartzite which is strongly altered.
Subsequent RC drilling Farandi South beneath the trench and along strike, over 800 metres, where Yalea historical RAB holes had intersected mineralisation, returned weaker results than anticipated with a best gold intersection Mines of 15 metres at 1.32g t beneath the trench.
The area is Targets entirely covered by transported palaeo-alluvial material.
Work is ongoing to further understand this target which is in a zone Prioritised regional target Yalea Ridge South of known complexity and high prospectivity where folding, faulting and boudinage are highly likely due to the proximity to the main Senegal-Mali Shear Zone and presence of soft limestone units.

This work identied several mineralised corridors striking both north-south and Kouassi-Datekro north-west across the permit, which host eight targets.
These include the Tiossera and Kounkana targets which have Cte dIvoire considerable strike potential of over two kilometres and have returned highly mineralised lithosamples 25g t, 16g t and 3g t from the extensive artisanal workings.
Subsequent trenching on both targets has revealed that narrow shear zones 3 to 5 metres host quartz veins and associated gold mineralisation but they are not of economic importance.
As well as continuing to evaluate Kampti, a key output for 500 kilometres N 2013 is to establish a new exploration portfolio either through Tongon mine the approval of applications in Randgolds own name or Exploration permits through joint venture.
