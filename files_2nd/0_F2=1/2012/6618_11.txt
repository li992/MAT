Looking ahead, the integration of 400 Viterras Canadian and Australian operations in 2013 should significantly enhance the division.

Drought in South Australia reduced the 2010 2011 2012 2012 crop which will adversely impact the 2013 grain handling business in that region.

2 For the purposes of this calculation, capital employed has been adjusted to move the Viterra related property, plant and equipment from industrial activities into marketing activities.
3 Adjusted EBIT return on average capital employed includes the relevant elements of Viterras balance sheet, but given the mid-December acquisition date, negligible Viterra EBIT has been recorded.
This distorts the return ratio in 2012, which otherwise would have exceeded 10%.

US soyabean production also suffered but not to the extent of corn or to the extent initially feared.
The drought, combined with poor growing conditions in the FSU and Central Europe, led a significant price rally of more than 30%, with grain markets reaching their peak in mid-August 2012 and oilseeds in early September 2012.
Between September and mid-December 2012, prices consolidated before weakening towards year-end on the prospect of record South American new crop production.
Cotton prices, which fell sharply early in 2012, were particularly subdued compared to 2011 and tightly range bound in the second half of the year.
MARKETINg INduSTRIAL Highlights Grain and oilseed volumes all exceeded 2011 by more than 20%, in part due to the overall increase in non-US seaborne trade as US exports, a market in which Glencore only has a small presence, were particularly curtailed by the drought.
Marketing Adjusted EBIT EBITDA for 2012 saw a healthy recovery compared to 2011, a year significantly impacted by the exceptional cotton market disruptions.
2012 Industrial EBITDA, admittedly off a low base, was sharply up on 2011, reflecting higher processing volumes, on the back of the three recent plant acquisitions and organic expansion initiatives.
2013 should benefit from a full year of crushing at Timbues, following its start-up in Q42012, increased sugarcane processing in Brazil and the addition of various industrial facilities emanating from the Viterra acquisition.

Rio Vermelho Glencore interest: 100% 1.3million tonnes of sugarcane were crushed in 2012, a 39% increase compared to 2011, which in turn produced 108,400tonnes of Very High Pol VHP sugar and 34,000 cubic metres of hydrous ethanol.
The on-going expansion plan at Rio Vermelho continues to progress on schedule.
The first phase of the cogeneration plant, eventually capable of supplying 200,000 megawatt hours per annum of surplus electricity to the power grid at maturity of the project in 2015, will become operational during H22013.
Other Agricultural Products Oilseed crushing In 2012, oilseed crushing volumes increased 38%, reflecting the additional volumes crushed at the three acquired plants Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine and the completion of the new plant constructed in Hungary.
Following the successful commissioning of Timbues Argentina in October 2012, the plant commenced crushing in December2012.
