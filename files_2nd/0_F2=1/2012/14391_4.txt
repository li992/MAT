Our strategy and indicators Strategy We have a five-part strategy for creating long-term value for our shareholders and we measure our performance against this strategy through several key performance indicators.
Driving top-line growth We drive our top-line growth in three ways.
First, we invest in research and development the lifeblood of a technology business such as Smiths.
This supports innovation and new product development.
Second, we look to expand in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil, through organic investment and acquisitions.
Third, we work to improve our sales and marketing effectiveness, for example through sharing tools and best practice around the world.
Enhancing margins We intend to continue to enhance our attractive margins through further operational improvement, leveraging our scale and IT systems, and focusing on low-cost manufacturing.
Generating cash and managing the balance sheet By emphasising working capital management, particularly our debtors and inventories, we are able to convert a high proportion of headline operating profit into cash.
We also look to optimise our capital structure and secure long-term nancing.
Our borrowings are mainly through long-term bonds rather than bank debt.
We also closely match the currency of our debt with our assets and earnings.
Allocating capital to maximise returns Smiths Group delivers high returns on capital.
We achieve this through disciplined capital allocation to the divisions, by enhancing our profitability and through active portfolio management, with a targeted programme of acquisitions and disposals.
At the same time, we actively manage our portfolio of liabilities, such as our dened benefit pension schemes and legacy product liability issues, so that we minimise their impact on our value creation.
Promoting corporate responsibility We promote a culture of responsibility throughout Smiths Group.
This requires us all to work according to our Code of Ethics.
The Group is also committed to working in a way that, as far as reasonably practicable, protects the health and safety of employees and minimises any environmental effects of its activities, products and services.
This delivers real business benets, while ensuring that we meet our obligations to all of our stakeholders.
