The grades and Cash cost per gold equivalent production volumes in 2012 were ounce in 2012, US$ oz stable, which resulted in continued leadership among our assets in terms of cost levels and EBITDA margin a record 65% in 2012.
65% Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2012 157 Koz Gold equivalent produced in 2012 Priorities for 2013 development of mining operations at In 2013 primary ore will continue to be Maminskoye, a newly acquired deposit mostly sourced from the Central pit in the region.
Although Maminskoye with potential additional third-party is expected to operate as a standalone supplies, and oxidised ore from the operation, we expect that expertise South pit.
Our team at Voro will also be sharing will be a great benefit, enabling involved in the evaluation of options and fast-track development of the deposit.

In 2012, such Ore from which mines Vorontsovskoye, stable at 5.8 g t and 1.7 g t. The preparations for mining CIL plant, ore processed was at 917 Kt, 2% above 2011, and measures included additional automated components, is processed Degtyarskoye at the south part of the Voro pit, which will be a main source recoveries increased to 78.9%, also a 2% increase.
These and further development of computerised mine planning, Voro heap leach of the oxidised ore in 2013, were completed during the year.
improvements helped to partially compensate for the decline including implementation of medium and long-term plans.
Type Cyanide leaching and in average grade processed 5.3 g t in 2012 compared to Merrill-Crowe At Degtyarskoye, mining was fully completed in November, 5.9 g t in 2011, a 11% decrease, and total production at the with 104 Kt of ore grading 3.0 g t mined during 2012.
Capacity Ktpa n a CIL circuit comprised 118 Koz of gold, 6% below 2011.

Nevertheless, we remain focused on continuous 10% improvement, implementing best Adjusted EBITDA growth, 2012 2011 practices in mining and processing technologies and leveraging existing capacity by the use of third-party ore sources.
A major highlight of the 6% year was the increase in reserves and resources on the back of Gold equivalent production growth, exploration results on the anks of 2012 2011 Varvarinskoye gold equivalent ore reserves up 50% to 1.6 Moz, mineral resources more than doubled to 3.6 Moz of gold equivalent.

This growth was mainly attributable to the debottlenecking and efficiency improvement.
These included Mining Type CIP Flotation leach circuit where throughput, grades and recoveries the design of an additional cyanidation tank, a control otation Ore mining at Varvara was 9% lower year-on-year while increased by 5%, 9% and 3%, respectively.

In addition, Ore from which mines positive dynamics.
Average gold grade was up 13% for the 5% year-on-year as a result of lower grades in ore processed in 2012 we installed a walking excavator which will allow is processed Varvarinskoye Varvarinskoye oat ore to 1.3 g t and up 11% for the leach ore to 0.9 g t, in the period, partially compensated for by increased us to reduce stripping costs through the use of relatively while copper content in the oat ore grew 31% to 0.8%.
