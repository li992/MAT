This gives us a significant scale advantage in data, with detailed customer level information from 49 million consumer records and eight million claims data points.
Using this data more effectively has enabled us to improve profitability through pricing risks more accurately.
By continuing to invest in our pricing capabilities we aim to offer our target customers competitive prices, while also continuing to manage value for our shareholders.
We have already enhanced the use of internal and external data, with twice as many risk factors tested as in 2009.
We are building a new rating engine with faster links to external data and the real-time deployment of pricing changes.
We aim to deliver industry leading technical pricing capabilities that will enable us to calculate the price implied by claims costs more accurately: and superior market pricing that will enable us to offer the right price to our target customers at any given point in time.
