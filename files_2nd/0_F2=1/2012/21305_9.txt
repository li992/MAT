Analysis of traded market risk exposures Following a volatile beginning to the year, markets steadily improved through the second half of the year with momentum gaining in the fourth quarter of 2012, even as some wider concerns persisted.
The Investment Banks focus on market risk exposures centred on limiting illiquid risk exposures when possible.
Primary risk metrics showed a fall in market risk from 2011 levels.
The three main contributors to total Daily Value at Risk DVaR were credit, spread and interest rate risk.
From 2011 levels, average credit risk DVaR fell by 3m 11%, spread DVaR fell by 2m 8% and interest rate DVaR fell by 3m 18%.
Total management DVaR fell by 19m 33% reflecting the sharp reduction in the DVaR measure.
Tail risk measures also indicate a similar decline in risk profile, with a particularly sharp fall in 3W.
However, some of this decline can be attributed to the rolling of the time period within the historical simulation.

It is measured as the sum of the individual asset class DVaR estimates less the total DVaR.
Notes a The high and low DVaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low DVaR reported as a whole.
Consequently a diversification effect balance for the high and low DVaR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.
b Diversification for 2011 has been restated to increase granularity by reporting DVaR asset class, primarily relating to credit and inflation, which were applied for the whole period, and basis VaR, which was introduced in 2011 resulting in its partial contribution to average diversification.
c The average of all one day hypothetical losses beyond the 95% confidence level DVaR.
d The average of the three largest one day estimated losses.

For the remainder of the year, DVaR remained relatively stable but at lower levels than seen in recent years.
VaR based tail measures such as Expected Shortfall and 3W also saw sharp falls from 2011.
Analysis of trading revenue audited The histogram above shows the distribution of daily trading revenue for the Investment Bank in 2012 and 2011.
Trading revenue excludes income from Private Equity and Principal Investments.
The average daily revenue at the Investment Bank in 2012 was 46m, up 11% from 2011.
There were more positive trading revenue days in 2012 than in 2011, with 88% of days generating positive trading revenue compared to 80% in 2011.
The second half of 2012 was much stronger than in 2011.
Analysis of stress testing Stress tests and scenario analysis also indicate a fall in market risk levels from 2011, in line with the trend in DVaR.
Combined stress scenarios show that a sharp and rapid slowdown in global economic activity is the largest threat to the trading exposures.
The scenario assumes an extreme and instant sell off across all risky assets coupled with a contraction in credit, and limited gains in safe havens.
The calculation assumes an instant shock to positions, without any opportunity to hedge immediately, and assumes an appropriate holding period where the firm may be unable to unwind its trading positions.
Non-traded market risk exposures audited Analysis of net interest income sensitivity The table below shows sensitivity analysis on the pre-tax net interest income for the non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.
The sensitivity has been measured using AEaR methodology as described on page 336 using a 100 bps movement.
The benchmark interest rate for each currency is set as at 31 December 2012.
The figures include the effect of hedging instruments but exclude banking book exposures held or issued by the Investment Bank as these are measured and managed using DVaR.

The increase in risk reflects an increase in the Group equity balances and associated hedges, partly offset by reduction in the margin compression in the retail bank.
AEaR is measured for a reduction in rates for the purposes of this analysis.

Customer liabilities represents customer deposits.
Net interest income on customer liabilities represents the interest income from the funds generated from customer liabilities at the internal rate of funding less the interest paid to customers.
Customer net interest income is the sum of customer asset and customer liability net interest income.
Under this approach, customer net interest income reflects interest related to customer assets and liabilities only and does not include any interest on securities or other non-customer assets and liabilities.
Non-customer interest income principally reflects the impact of product and equity structural hedges, as well as certain other net interest income received on government bonds and other debt securities held for the purposes of interest rate hedging and liquidity for local banking activities.
All reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and related interest are recorded in the Investment Bank and are therefore not included in the Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management customer margins data.
The customer asset margin is defined as net interest income earned on customer assets excluding the impact of the product structural hedge relating to those assets, divided by total average customer assets.
Similarly, the customer liability margin is net interest income earned on customer liabilities excluding the impact of the product structural hedge relating to those liabilities, divided by total average customer liabilities.
The customer net interest margin is calculated as net interest income on both customer assets and liabilities excluding the impact of product structural hedges as a percentage of the sum of average customer assets and liabilities, consistent with the presentation of the net interest margin.
The non-customer generated margin is calculated as non-customer net interest income principally comprising the impact of both the product and equity structural hedges as a percentage of the sum of average customer assets and liabilities, consistent with the presentation of the net interest margin.

The overall contribution to Group income from structural hedges decreased by 1,540m to 1,737m.
Of this decrease, 1,061m related to the non-recurrence of gains from the sale of hedging instruments in the second half of 2011, which did not contribute to Group net interest income in 2011 as it was recognised as non-interest income, but a proportion of which is reflected in the net interest income of Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management, shown above.
Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management net interest income Barclays distinguishes the relative net interest contribution from customer assets and customer liabilities, and separates this from the contribution delivered by non-customer income, which principally arises from the Group hedging activities.
Customer net interest income Customer net interest income decreased marginally to 9,816m 2011: 9,849m, principally due to reductions in the customer asset margin across the majority of businesses partially offset by growth in average customer assets and liabilities.
The customer asset margin declined to 2.11% 2011: 2.19%, reflecting an increase in funding rates across Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management businesses.
This was partially offset by a move towards higher margin business in Africa RBB.
The customer liability margin increased to 1.09% 2011: 1.06% reflecting increased funding rates and therefore value generated from Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management customer liabilities.
Non-customer net interest income Non-customer net interest income decreased 37% to 1,338m, reflecting a reduction in the benefits from Group hedging activities.
Group hedging activities utilise structural interest rate hedges to mitigate the impact of the low interest rate environment on customer liabilities and the Groups equity.
Product structural hedges generated a lower contribution of 989m 2011: 1,168m.
Hedge durations were maintained throughout the period.
Based on current interest rate curves and the ongoing hedging strategy, fixed rate returns on product structural hedges are expected to continue to make a significant but declining contribution in 2013.
The contribution from equity structural hedges in Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management decreased to 231m 2011: 824m following the sale of hedging instruments in the second half of 2011 and the continued low interest rate environment.
Other Group net interest income Head Office and Other Operations net interest expense decreased to 134m 2011: 965m principally reflecting the non-recurrence of a transfer of gains from the sale of hedging instruments to businesses.
Investment Bank net interest income decreased 47% to 619m, due to a reduction in interest income from equity structural hedges and credit market exposures.
Total Group income from equity structural hedges decreased to 748m 2011: 2,109m including 517m 2011: 1,285m that was allocated to the Investment Bank and Head Office.
Notes a Product structural hedges convert short term interest margin volatility on product balances such as non-interest bearing current accounts and managed rate deposits into a more stable medium term rate and are built on a monthly basis to achieve a targeted maturity profile.
b Equity structural hedges are in place to manage the volatility in net earnings generated by businesses on the Groups equity, with the impact allocated to businesses in line with their economic capital usage.
158 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Net interest margin The net interest margin for Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management decreased to 1.85% 2011: 2.03%, reflecting the reduction in contribution from Group hedging activities.
Consistent with prior periods the net interest margin is expressed as a percentage of the sum of average customer assets and liabilities, to reflect the impact of the margin generated on retail and commercial banking liabilities.
The net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average customer assets only, declined to 3.50% 2011: 3.77%.
An analysis is provided below for Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management for each of the component parts of net interest income.
The increase in funding rates has had an adverse impact on customer asset margins and a benefit to customer liability margins, resulting in a reduction of 3bps 2011: 2bps in the net interest margin.
The Group uses a range of internal funding rates which price intra-group funding and liquidity to give credit to businesses with net surplus liquidity and to charge those businesses in need of wholesale funding at a rate that is driven by prevailing market rates and includes term premiums.
The objective is to price internal funding for assets and liabilities in line with the cost of alternative external funding, which ensures there is consistency between retail and wholesale sources.
Rates are applied to all entities within the Group on a consistent basis.
There have been no material changes to the methodologies used during 2012.
Note a 2011 comparatives have been revised to reflect certain corporate banking activities previously reported in Africa RBB which are now included within Corporate Banking.
Corporate Banking average customer assets, average customer liabilities and net interest income have therefore been adjusted by 1,731m, 6,740m and 118m respectively although the net interest margin remains at 1.46%.
Africa RBB comparatives have additionally been revised to include gross cheque advances and cheque deposits of 798m within average assets and average liabilities respectively where these were previously reported net.
The Africa RBB net interest margin is therefore revised to 3.22% previously reported as 3.07% and the Group 2011 net interest margin is revised to 2.03% previously reported as 2.04%.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 159 Risk review Market risk continued Foreign exchange risk audited The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk: a Transactional foreign currency exposure Transactional foreign exchange exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity.
The Groups risk management policies prevent the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside the trading portfolio managed by the Investment Bank which is monitored through DVaR.
There were no material net transactional foreign currency exposures outside the trading portfolio at either 31 December 2012 or 2011.
Due to the low level of non-trading exposures no reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates would have a material effect on either the Groups profit or movements in equity for either of the years ended 31 December 2012 or 2011. b Translational foreign exchange exposure The Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies principally US Dollar, Euro and South African Rand.
Changes in the Sterling value of the investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in Core Tier 1 capital.
The Groups strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by using the Core Tier 1 capital movements to broadly match the revaluation of the Groups foreign currency RWA exposures.
During 2012, total structural currency exposures net of hedging instruments decreased from 16.7bn to 16.3bn, as a result of hedging decisions taken in accordance with the Groups capital ratio management strategy for foreign exchange rate movements.
The economic hedges primarily represent the US Dollar and Euro preference shares and reserve capital instruments in issue that are treated as equity under IFRS, and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Other market risks Pension risk Barclays maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees.
The ability of the pension fund to meet the projected pension payments is maintained principally through investments.
Pension risk arises because the estimated market value of the pension fund assets might decline: or their investment returns might reduce: or the estimated value of the pension liabilities might increase.
Barclays monitors the market risks arising from its defined benefit pension schemes, and works with the trustees to address shortfalls.
In these circumstances, Barclays could be required or might choose to make extra contributions to the pension fund.
Financial details of the pension fund are in Note 37 on page 296.
Asset management structural risk Asset management structural risk arises where the fee and commission income earned by asset management products is affected by a change in market levels, primarily through the link between income and the value of assets under management.
Asset management structural risk mainly resides in Wealth and Investment Management.
It is Barclays policy that businesses monitor and regularly assess potential hedging strategies.
Disclosures about certain trading activities including non-exchange traded commodity contracts The Group provides a fully integrated service to clients for base metals, precious metals, oil, power, natural gas, coal, freight, emission credits, structured products and other related commodities.
The Group offers both over the counter OTC and exchange traded derivatives, including swaps, options, forwards and futures and enters into physically settled contracts in base metals, power and gas, oil and related products.
Physical commodity positions are held at fair value and reported under the trading portfolio in Note 13 on page 252.
The fair values of physical and derivative positions are primarily determined through a combination of recognised market observable prices, exchange prices, and established inter-commodity relationships.
Further information on fair value measurement of financial instruments can be found in Note 18 on page 258-270. Credit risk exposures are actively managed by the Group.
Refer to the credit risk section on page 116 for more information on the Groups approach to credit risk management and the credit quality of derivative assets.
The tables below analyse the overall fair value of the OTC commodity derivative contracts by movement over time and contractual maturity.
As at 31 December 2012 the fair value of the commodity derivative contracts reflects a gross positive fair value of 13,227m 2011: 20,588m and a gross negative value of 14,061m 2011: 20,133m.
