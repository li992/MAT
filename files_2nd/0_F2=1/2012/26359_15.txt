Overview Business review Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 56 57 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 diVisiOnAl REsulTs Commercial Banking Strategic focus commercial Bankings strategy is to be the best bank for our clients.
We have put clients at the centre of our business model and will lead our business through four coverage segments: small and Medium-sized Enterprises sME, Mid Markets, Global corporates and Financial institutions.
We will meet our clients needs with a suite of core banking products from lending and Transaction Banking to Financial Markets and capital Markets, delivering the full capability of the bank to our clients and serving their needs as they move up the value chain.
Our strategy is driven by three guiding principles: to be client centric, uK focused and capital efficient with a rigorous focus on executing our plans according to these core principles.
Our business will be delivered through the formation of a simpler leaner organisation, sharper prioritisation of resources to support our core clients and focused investment in product capability to better serve our clients needs.
All of this will contribute to the delivery of strong and sustainable commercial Banking returns over time.
Progress against strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2012, commercial Banking reshaped the business, bringing sME clients together with larger corporate uK and global clients to ensure consistent and effective client coverage.
We continue our exercise to re-segment our client coverage, driven by evolving client behaviours.
For sME and Mid Markets clients we are strengthening our face-to-face banking proposition as well as working to improve the delivery of simple products to meet simple needs through enhanced digital capability.
For larger corporate clients we are strengthening our product capability through investment in Transaction Banking at the same time as enriching the core proposition in Financial Markets and capital Markets to improve fee generating solutions.
in 2012, we made good progress in simplifying the business through a series of initiatives to streamline operational processes and improve client experience and service.
We have already delivered benefits through fide-layering the organisation and removing inefficiencies and will continue to benefit as we deliver synergies from bringing the legacy divisions together.
Within sME, significant progress has been made in simplifying the lending process and the time taken to complete lending transactions to clients has almost halved from the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2012.
The reshaping and simplifying of the business is leading to a more effective and agile organisation.
We have sharpened our focus on strengthening the balance sheet and improving capital efficiency through the development of more considered client participation and controlled reduction of the non-core portfolio.
Within our core business, we have further refined our client participation and will rationalise exposure to capital-intensive businesses.
in 2012, for example we discontinued our origination of new Project Finance business in the us and restricted new origination in Australia to key clients with strong uK linkage only, and reduced our exposure to parts of the corporate real estate portfolio that do not deliver acceptable returns.
We have continued to reduce our exposure to non-core assets, achieving a substantial reduction of 33.2 billion in 2012, a decrease of 44 per cent.
We continued to invest in product capability in 2012 and are positioning ourselves to benefit from eventual economic recovery.
As part of our programme to enhance our capabilities in capital efficient products, we have continued to invest in the Transaction Banking platform delivering product capabilities in card Payments & Acceptance, currencies and international cash Management.
Meanwhile, we processed all ticket payments and provided merchant support at all of the principal london 2012 Olympic sites.
in Foreign Exchange, client volumes increased by 19 per cent compared to 2011 through investments in electronic channels and improved pricing and risk management capabilities.
More specifically on client connectivity we are making good progress in Foreign Exchange service to provide our clients with a seamless 24 hour service globally in 2013.
Additionally, in 2012 we continued our focus to support the uK economy through financing uK sMEs and developing discounted funding propositions for our clients through the uK Governments national loan Guarantee scheme and the Funding for lending scheme Fls.
in sME we grew our core net lending by 4 per cent in a market which contracted by 4 per cent and we helped in excess of 120,000 sMEs to start up in 2012.
External recognition of our support for sMEs includes being voted as the Winner of the innovation in sME Finance award from Business Moneyfacts, as well as Most supportive lender of the Year from the national Association of commercial Finance Brokers.
in Mid Markets we grew share of lending in a declining market and will invest in additional capacity to support our clients in 2013. in social Housing, within Mid Markets, we topped the Housing Association Bond league table in 2012 with 10 Bookrunner mandates for 10 separate housing associations, highlighting our support for clients and contributing to the availability of housing stock in the uK.
in 2012, we supported our Global corporate clients in raising 12.8 billion of financing through the debt capital Markets, enabling them to finance and grow their businesses.
We have made good progress in creating solutions for our clients, attaining a top five position in investment Grade corporate sterling debt issuance, and were awarded the 2012 Greenwich Quality leader award for large corporate Banking in the uK, recognising our strong client experience.
in Project Finance, we provided in excess of 750 million of lending to uK infrastructure initiatives and achieved the top uK Bookrunner position in 2012.
We received the PPP deal of the Year award in 2012 from Project Finance international, highlighting our commitment and the key role we are playing in supporting uK infrastructure projects that are vital for stimulating economic growth.
in ldc, our private equity arm, we continued to invest equity through the cycle in support of clients across sME and Mid Markets.
during 2012, 96 per cent of our investment was focused on the uK with over 300 million invested in new portfolio companies.
As a testament to our client-centric approach, commercial Banking was awarded for the eighth year in a row the Business Bank of the Year at the Fds Excellence Awards in association with the institute of chartered Accountants in England and Wales, supported by the cBi.
We have grown our capabilities in Transaction Banking and capital Markets and increased fee based income.
This is in line with broader market trends as clients needs have become less lending-reliant and more focused on liability and risk management solutions.
As we execute our strategy to be client centric, uK focused and capital efficient this increase in fee based income from client solutions will be an important driver of our income over time.

loans and advances to customers, excluding reverse repos, decreased by 21.0 billion, of which 16.3 billion was driven by the non-core asset reduction.
core lending decreased by 4.7 billion as demand for new corporate lending and refinancing of existing facilities was more than offset by the level of maturities, reflecting a continued trend of subdued corporate lending demand and client deleveraging as credit facilities matured and were not renewed by clients.
