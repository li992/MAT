Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Business review Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 23 August 2012: Diageo is a strong business, getting stronger and the results we released this morning show that very clearly.
We have increased our presence in the faster growing markets of the world, through both acquisitions and strong organic growth.
We have enhanced our leading brand positions globally, through effective marketing and industry leading innovation and we have strengthened our routes to market.
6% organic top line growth, 9% operating profit growth and 60 basis points of margin expansion is a strong performance and demonstrates our commitment to delivering efficient growth.
A year ago I set out our expectations for the medium term and these results put us firmly on track to meet those goals.
In F12, we have continued to invest to ensure this business is well positioned for the future.
Our confidence in the achievement of our medium term guidance is underscored by the 8% recommended increase in our final dividend.
