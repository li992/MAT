Impaired loans are all loans including renegotiated and forbearance loans for which an impairment provision has been established: for collectively assessed loans, impairment loss provisions are not allocated to individual loans and the entire portfolio is included in impaired loans.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more comprise loans past due 90 days where no impairment loss is expected and those awaiting individual assessment.
A latent loss provision is established for the latter.
'Foreign' comprises the Group's transactions conducted through offices outside the UK and through those offices in the UK specifically organised to service international banking transactions.
2 The write-off of impaired loans affects the closing provisions for impairment as a % of total risk elements in lending the coverage ratio.
The coverage ratio reduces if the loan written off carries a higher than average provision and increases if the loan written off carries a lower than average provision.
3 Impaired loans at 31 December 2012 include 5,350 million of loans whose terms were renegotiated or secured retail loans subject to forbearance granted during 2012.

This category is used for advances which are not past due 90 days or revolving credit facilities where identification as 90 days overdue is not feasible.
2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 m m m m m Potential problem loans 807 739 633 1,009 226 Both REIL and PPL are reported gross and take no account of the value of any security held which could reduce the eventual loss should it occur, nor of any provision marked.
Therefore impaired assets which are highly collateralised, such as mortgages, will have a low coverage ratio of provisions held against the reported impaired balance.

These loans are unimpaired: either the loan was performing before and after the renegotiation or the granting of forbearance or the loan was non-performing before but subsequently transferred to the performing book.
Loans with impairment provisions subject to renegotiation or forbearance continue to be reported as impaired loans.

2 For 2012, wholesale renegotiations were 4,302 million refer to page 174 and secured retail loans subject to forbearance were 4,026 million refer to page 177.

The balance of unsecured retail loans subject to forbearance amounts to 182 million.
Cross border exposures Cross border exposures are loans and advances including finance leases and instalment credit receivables and other monetary assets, such as debt securities, including non-local currency claims of overseas offices on local residents.
The Group monitors the geographical breakdown of these exposures based on the country of domicile of the borrower or guarantor of ultimate risk.
Cross border exposures exclude exposures to local residents in local currencies.
The table below sets out the Groups cross border exposures greater than 0.5% of the Groups total assets.
None of these countries have experienced repayment difficulties that have required restructuring of outstanding debt.

Balances are generally based on monthly data.
Average interest rates during the year are computed by dividing total interest expense by the average amount borrowed.
Average interest rates at year end are average rates for a single day and as such may reflect one-day market distortions, which may not be indicative of generally prevailing rates.
Other contractual cash obligations The table below summarises the Group's other contractual cash obligations by payment date.
While the Group has given commitments to provide these funds, some facilities may be subject to certain conditions being met by the counterparty.
The Group does not expect all facilities to be drawn, and some may lapse before drawdown.
