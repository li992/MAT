2 In Q2 2010, the APA and the Group reached agreement over the classification of some structured credit assets which resulted in adjustments to the covered amount, without affecting the underlying risk protection.
Key points x The reduction in covered assets was due to run-off of the portfolio, disposals, early repayments and maturing loans.
x As part of the Groups risk reduction strategy significant disposals were made from the Structured Credit Portfolio 2010 - 3.0 billion.
The Group took advantage of market conditions and executed sales from its derivative, loan and leveraged finance portfolios 2010 - 6.7 billion.

The Group expects additional assets to trigger upon expiry of relevant grace periods based on the current risk rating and level of impairments on covered assets.
2 Following the reclassification of some structured credit assets from derivatives to debt securities, the APA and the Group also reached agreement on an additional implied write down trigger in respect of these assets.
This occurs if a on two successive relevant payment dates, the covered asset has a rating of Caa2 or below by Moodys, CCC or below by Standard & Poors or Fitch or a comparable rating from an internationally recognised credit rating agency and or b on any two successive relevant payment dates, the mark-to-market value of the covered asset is equal to or less than 40 per cent of the par value of the covered asset, in each case as at such relevant payment date.
3 Under the Scheme rules, the Group may apply to the APA for loss credits in respect of the disposal of non-triggered assets.
A loss credit counts towards the first loss threshold and is typically determined by the APA based on the expected loss of the relevant asset.
4 The Group and the APA remain in discussion with regard to loss credits in relation to the withdrawal of 2.0 billion of derivative assets during Q2 2010 and the disposal of approximately 1.6 billion of structured finance and leveraged finance assets in 2010.
5 The Scheme rules contain provision for on-going revision of data.
Key points x The Group received loss credits in relation to some of the withdrawals and disposals of 1.2 billion in 2010. x The Group currently expects recoveries on triggered amounts to be approximately 45% over the life of the relevant assets.
On this basis, the expected loss on triggered assets at 31 December 2010 is approximately 25 billion 42% of the 60 billion first loss threshold under APS.
