The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: The increase in net interest income reflects a mixed performance across geographies and business activity: UK and Europe: benefited from higher margin earned on an increasing average floating rate Kensington portfolio as well as an enhanced return on select structured credit investments, offset by higher funding costs and lower spreads earned on surplus cash balances held Southern Africa: negatively impacted by the declining interest rate environment and higher cash balances held Australia: benefited from higher margins earned on investments in instruments purchased at opportunistic prices The decrease in net fee and commission income is largely attributable to a downturn in the Irish economy with the Irish business earning 26 million less than the prior period.
Activity levels in the advisory and structuring businesses are lower than historic trends across all of our businesses.
The Australian business earned a significant fee in Project Management The increase in principal transactions primarily reflects a growth in the Structured Equities business as well as increased activity in the Principal Finance business.
This has been offset by a poorer trading performance on certain desks, largely as a result of declining volatility levels.
The division was also successful in realising gains on the sale of certain of its investments, notably in South Africa and Australia Impairment losses on loans and advances have decreased during the year Expenses have increased largely due to an increase in headcount for certain growing businesses, variable remuneration and the amortisation of expenses related to new systems implemented.

The Fixed Income desk was closed during the period The Structured Equity retail distribution platforms have been established and have recently marketed launch 17 in the UK market.
Recent awards won include: Best Structured Product Provider Professional Adviser Awards 2010, Best Structured Product Provider Financial Times and Investors Chronicle Investment Awards 2009, Best Service to IFAs and Best Income Product for FTSE 100 Bonus Income Plan PPR Professional Adviser Structured Products Awards 2009.
We are currently one of the top two retail structured product issuers in the UK market The Principal Finance business has continued to take advantage of the condition of the credit markets through its credit investments and trading operations The Treasury Products and Distribution desk has been established to actively market structured solutions, foreign exchange and interest rates to the corporate market and is gaining traction in client acquisition and volumes traded The focus on raising customer deposits has significantly reduced our reliance on the wholesale markets.
Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 96 Southern Africa Activity levels in our Specialised Lending businesses were subdued and our core advances book showed a net year on year decrease.
Average margins were however maintained throughout the year Impairments reduced substantially from the prior year and were in line with anticipated levels We continue to hold a number of equity positions emanating from our lending activities and the overall impact on profits was negative but an improvement on the prior year.
We anticipate a number of realisations over the next 12 months We took advantage of certain dislocations in the credit markets local and international and created a portfolio of highly rated yield 2 enhancing credit transactions Client flows continued to decrease across our Financial Market Derivative businesses and this negatively affected the results from Equity and Foreign Exchange Treasury and Trading Activities.
Results from Interest Rate Activities remained consistent.
We did however maintain or increase market share across all market segments in which we operate.
We continue to hold significant market share in listed derivative products Significant surplus liquidity levels were maintained throughout the year.
This is invested in highly liquid assets and we continue to be a provider of liquidity to the South African interbank market.
Australia While activity in the resources sector was initially quiet, the rapid recovery of the equity and commodity markets, as well as our refocused marketing to mid-tier and larger mining companies, resulted in increased deal flow during the year for our Commodities and Resource Finance business A strong performance in our project advisory, debt arranging and principal lending activities was driven by improved market conditions, cross-border deals and some significant advisory and arranging mandates, notably the debt financing of the Collgar Wind Farm.
In parallel, our wind farm development business finalised the sale of Collgar to institutional investors This was a year of consolidation for the Structured Finance business with emphasis on improved operational capability for the Investec Global Aircraft Fund IGAF coupled with the additional capital raising of A$45 million Ongoing management of the legacy book was a key priority for the Principal Finance business, but this was coupled with strong deal flow and revenue generation from new lending in the media and entertainment sectors as well as credit trading in both structured credit and corporate debt Wholesale capital raising under the Australian Government Guarantee Scheme continued successfully, albeit at the higher margins prevailing in the post global financial crisis market.
The resultant liquidity was actively invested in high quality liquid assets and other appropriate securities and this generated strong returns The trading desk performed well despite operating within very narrow risk limits and it benefited from favourable positioning in the interest rate and foreign exchange markets.
Outlook, risks and opportunities We are a focused business targeting markets where we can be distinctive and competitive We remain committed to building a sustainable business franchise with diversified revenue streams in our core geographies In the UK and Southern Africa we will continue to strive for depth and greater penetration.
In Australia we continue to look for opportunities to broaden our franchise The current negative cycle is the time to shape the business for the future and to position ourselves for growth in a changed competitive landscape This stage of the cycle is likely to see continuing defaults but impairments and losses will be lower Looking at the environment in our core geographies: In South Africa the impact of the global recession is being felt.
We are generally well positioned in this market with a reasonably robust credit portfolio.
The effects of the recession have lead to reduced activity in the structuring and lending businesses and trading volumes are down.
Reduced activity is to some extent offset by wider margins and the landscape for PFI has improved Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 97 Capital Markets continued In the UK the environment remains weak but is starting to recover.
The changed competitive landscape is allowing us to win clients.
Overall we continue to be reasonably well positioned and activity is starting to increase In Australia the environment is improving and we are seeing an increase in business flows.
Whilst the corporate credit environment remains a concern, overall we are positioning ourselves for growth The environment has changed but so too has the competitive landscape.
A large amount of capacity has been removed from the market and the number of players in our core geographies has reduced substantially.
This plays to our strengths of being a specialist and bespoke service provider.
In the short term we expect conditions to remain challenging: however, we believe that in the medium term this is an excellent opportunity to grow market share and deepen our franchise.
2 UK and Europe We look forward to executing our first securitisations during the year as the asset backed securitisation market reopens.
We have commenced modest new loan origination in Kensington in the prime product range Liquidity is no longer a constraint although the cost of raising and carrying surplus liquidity is causing a negative impact on net interest income.
We have very little reliance on the wholesale markets The UK market is showing signs of growth once more and we are well positioned to take advantage of this upturn in the market The outlook on bad debts is substantially lower than at the same time last year The corporate market has opened itself to new relationships and we are taking advantage of the opportunity.
Southern Africa The division is well positioned for any potential upturn in the general economy, although we do not expect this until the second half of the financial year The overall credit portfolio is robust with higher margins Volumes and activity in the financial markets remain subdued and therefore trading and structuring opportunities are expected to remain at lower levels for at least the first half of the next financial year We anticipate growing both our credit portfolio and investment product retail offerings which will increase the level of annuity based income We anticipate that we will continue to be a net provider of liquidity to the interbank market and plan to increase the average duration of our wholesale funding base.
Australia In resources, we continue to build a pipeline of deals focused on mid-tier and larger mining companies with one or more assets in production, where the risk and return profile remains attractive In aviation, we intend to work closely with Investecs aviation finance teams in London and Johannesburg to pursue aircraft leasing transactions and, in parallel, create investment opportunities for the additional capital that has been raised for the IGAF In renewable energy, we continue to work on a fleet of development assets in a range of technologies and will seek to exit some of these during the course of the year.
In parallel our project advisory, debt arranging and principal lending business is expected to remain active based on current deal pipeline and market conditions Our newly established Corporate Debt business, which targets event driven borrowing by mid-tier and larger corporates, has already achieved some success in the domestic market and we expect to see strong deal flow in this business In our Principal Finance team, we continue to seek opportunities in the structured credit market, whether as short-term credit trading strategies or as longer term holds of quality assets at margins which remain attractive notwithstanding the compression that has already occurred Treasury will focus on ongoing balance sheet management priorities particularly optimising our strong liquidity position and, more urgently, will be growing our sales and structuring activities Our trading business remains one with modest market risk and, as our sales activities generate additional customer flow, we will look to broaden this business in order to meet the requirements of these clients.
