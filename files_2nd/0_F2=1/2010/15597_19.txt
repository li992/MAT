This is secured by a fixed and floating charge on a cash deposit.
3 The basis used for calculating transfer values was revised during the year because changes in financial conditions meant that the previous basis for calculating transfer values, used since 2008, no longer produced reasonable values.
Transfer values at 28 February 2009 have been restated using the new basis for comparative purposes.
4 Sir Terry Leahy is entitled to retire at any age from 57 to 60 inclusive with an immediate pension of two-thirds of base salary.
5 Inflation over the year has been allowed for using the September 2009 statutory revaluation order.

62 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Remumeration report 1 Table 6 Long-Term Performance Share Plan continued 4 The awards are subject to performance conditions based on Return on Capital Employed targets.
The Group ROCE for 2008 9 was 13.34%, therefore targets for PSP awards granted on 20 July 2006 were partially met and 90% of these awards vested.
The balance of the awards 10% lapsed.
Executives are required to retain the vested awards for a further 12 months with the exception of the circumstances covered in notes 5 and 6.
Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2007 AGM for the removal of the requirement for any vested shares to be retained for a further 12 months and this applies to awards made after July 2007.
All awards are increased to reflect dividend equivalents as each dividend is paid with the exception of the 2004 award on which no dividends accrue.
5 Following approval by the Remuneration Committee, Executives were offered the opportunity to surrender the nil cost options awarded on 20 July 2006 in exchange for an equivalent number of restricted shares, and to fund the income tax and national insurance due on these awards at the point of exchange 27 November 2009.
The balance of shares shown is in the form of restricted shares, and remains subject to the retention period which ends on 20 July 2010.
6 Following approval by the Remuneration Committee, Executives were given the opportunity to surrender the nil cost options awarded on 20 July 2006 in exchange for an award of an equivalent number of restricted shares on 25 February 2010, and to sell sufficient shares to cover the tax liability due.
The post tax number of shares under award remains subject to the retention period and will not be released until 20 July 2010.
The share price on 25 February 2010 was 416.175p.
The awards made under this plan will normally vest in four tranches, four, five, six and seven years after the date of award for nil consideration.
The award is in the form of nil cost options.
Awards may be adjusted to take account of any dividends paid or that are payable in respect of the number of shares earned.
2 The vesting of the award made to the Group CEO under this plan will be conditional upon achievement against Group and International performance conditions.
The performance conditions under this award will be aligned with the targets set for awards made under the Performance Share Plan PSP in each of the years 2007 to 2009, which will become capable of vesting between 2010 and 2012.
If less than threshold performance is achieved for each of these PSP awards then no portion of the Group Plan award will become capable of vesting.
If maximum Group and International performance is achieved for each of these PSP awards i. e. the 2007 2009 PSP awards vest in full in 2010 2012, then the whole of the Group Plan award will become eligible for vesting, subject to achievement of the appropriate new business performance targets referred to below.
If Group and International performance for any of these PSP awards is between threshold and maximum levels then the Group award will become eligible for vesting on a pro rata basis, subject always to the achievement of the appropriate new business targets referred to below.
3 Once performance against the Group and International targets has been determined, the extent to which the award made to the Group CEO under this Plan is capable of vesting will be conditional on the financial performance of the specified new business venture, as determined by the Remuneration Committee.

Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed in the US business over the seven-year plan.
The targets are set out under table 7.
2 The maximum number of shares which may be awarded under the US LTIP is two million shares to the US CEO and 1.5 million shares to any other participant.
An award of two million shares was made to Tim Mason, US CEO, in November 2007.
The extent to which awards will vest under the US LTIP is conditional on the financial performance of the Companys US business, based on the achievement of stretching Earnings Before Interest and Tax EBIT and Return On Capital Employed ROCE targets set by reference to the US long-term business plan.
3 A percentage of the EBIT of the US business for the relevant years may be allocated to an EBIT pool the profit pool.
The profit pool will be capped at 10% in any one year and is expected to be approximately 5% of cumulative EBIT over the four measurement years 2010 11 to 2013 14.
The portion of an award which may vest will be determined by reference to the value of the EBIT pool as well as performance against the ROCE hurdles for the relevant year, as outlined in the table above.
To the extent that the ROCE hurdles for any one year are met either in full or in part, but there is insufficient value in the profit pool to fund the vesting of awards, then the actual vesting in that year will be scaled back so that the profit pool is not exceeded.
That portion of the award that has not paid out in that year due to the profit pool being restricted may vest in future years, provided that the profit pool in any later year permits this.
4 The targets for the US LTIP have been based on the business plan in respect of the initial phase of the US business.
The Remuneration Committee has the responsibility to review these targets in light of the scale and scope of the US business in order to ensure that they remain appropriate and challenging.
In particular, the Remuneration Committee will seek the input of the Audit Committee and the Governance Oversight Committee in order to ensure that financial performance against the targets is indicative of strong and robust business performance.
Any material adjustments made in respect of the targets will be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and will be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The first award under the new plan was made in 2005.
The awards are subject to performance conditions based on TSR, earnings per share and corporate objectives.
