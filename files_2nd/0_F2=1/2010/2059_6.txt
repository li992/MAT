Business review 14 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Key business developments 2010 was a pivotal year for BGGroup as the largest growth opportunities in the Groups history began tocrystallise.
Key developments were sanctioned in Australia, the first permanent production facility came onstream in Brazil and, in less than a year, BG Groups USshale gas business has doubled estimates of production for 2015.
