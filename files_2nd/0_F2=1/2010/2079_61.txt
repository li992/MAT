R. SiO is silica that is reactive in the refinery process.

4 MRN MRN Crude is mined product feed to the washplant.
MRN Washed tonnes and grade represent expected product based on forecast beneficiated yield in the resource area.
This resource is now reported with dilution.

MRN Washed tonnes and grade 2 3 2 represent expected product based on forecast beneficiated yield in the reserve area.
6 The MRN Reserves are located on mining leases that provide MRN the right to mine.
Current mining areas have full environmental approvals and reflect the nature of environmental permits in Brazil where a three stage process is adopted.
For the 160 Mt Measured and Indicated Resources, MRN has received the preliminary and, in some cases, the second stage approvals.
Negotiation with the Brazilian environmental authorities on these mining areas is ongoing.
As such, related resources will be reclassified to reserves in the immediate future once the licence approval is granted.
The remaining changes to Reserves are due to production depletion and a geological model update, which now includes the expected dilution.
