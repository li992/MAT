HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 1 Introduction Weve made good progress over the last three years.
Our transformation plan successfully achieved nearly everything that we set out to do to protect the areas of our retail business where the structural changes have been the most profound, save money by operating more efficiently as a Group and grow in new channels.
As a result, our business today is on a much stronger footing.
Our markets will continue to change, however: meaning we must at least maintain the pace at which we are adapting.
The next phase of our journey will see us continue to make our retail businesses relevant to the customers of today and tomorrow.
Stretching beyond traditional retail, weve embarked upon some exciting new growth opportunities for the Group.
We will also maintain our discipline for tightly controlling what we spend and where.
We have every reason to be proud of our recent highlights, and are realistic about our changing markets.
With a clear focus on delivering our new objectives, we remain resolute about achieving our goal of sustainable, long-term growth.
