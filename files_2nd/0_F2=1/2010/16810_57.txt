Pensions Vittorio Colao, Michel Combes and Stephen Pusey have elected to take a cash allowance of 30% of base salary in lieu of pension contributions.
Andy Halford was a contributing member of the Vodafone Group Pension Scheme, a UK defined benefit scheme approved by HMRC until 31 March 2010.
The scheme provides a benefit of two-thirds of pensionable salary after a minimum of 20 years service.
The normal retirement age is 60 but directors may retire from age 55 with a pension proportionately reduced to account for their shorter service, but with no actuarial reduction.
Andys pensionable salary is capped in line with the Vodafone Group pension scheme rules at 110,000.
Andy has elected to take a cash allowance of 30% of base salary in lieu of pension contributions on salary above the scheme cap.
Liabilities in respect of the pension schemes in which the executive directors participate are funded to the extent described in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2010 Vodafone confirmed it would close its UK defined benefit scheme to future accrual by existing members on 31 March 2010.
From 1 April 2010 Andy Halford will be paid a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 30% of his full basic salary.
All the individuals referred to above are provided benefits in the event of death in service.
They also have an entitlement under a long-term disability plan from which twothirds of base salary, up to a maximum benefit determined by the insurer, would be provided until normal retirement date.
Pension benefits earned by the directors serving during the year ended 31 March 2010 were: Transfer value Employer Change in Change in of increase allocation Change in transfer value accrued in accrued contribution Total accrued accrued Transfer Transfer over year less benefit in benefit net to defined benefit at 31 benefit over value at 31 value at 31 member excess of of member contribution 1 1 2 2 March 2010 the year March 2010 March 2009 contributions inflation contributions plans 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Vittorio Colao Andy Halford 17.8 6.5 628.0 543.6 80.6 6.2 Michel Combes Stephen Pusey Notes: 1 Andy Halford took the opportunity to take early retirement from the pension scheme due to the closure of the scheme on 31 March 2010.
In accordance with the scheme rules, his accrued pension at this date was reduced with an early retirement factor for four years to reflect the fact that his pension is being paid before age 55 and is therefore expected to be paid out for a longer period of time.
In addition, Andy Halford exchanged part of his early retirement pension at 31 March 2010 for a tax-free cash lump sum of 118,660.
The accrued benefit of 17,800 shown above is Andy Halfords pension after the application of an early retirement factor and after cash has been taken.
There is therefore a negative change in accrued benefit over the year.
The accrued pension benefits earned by the directors are those which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year, at the normal retirement age.
The increase in accrued pension excludes any increase for inflation.
2 The transfer values 31 March 2010 have been calculated on the basis and methodology set by the Trustees after taking actuarial advice.
No director elected to pay additional voluntary contributions.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
In respect of senior management, the Group has made aggregate contributions of 851,000 into defined contribution pension schemes and had a total service cost of 360,000 for defined pension liabilities.
