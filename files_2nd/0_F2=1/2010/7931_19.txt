We aim to report data for the new set of indicators in our 2011 report.
2 Due to the increased scale and scope of our organisation following the Altadis acquisition in January 2008, care should be taken when comparing data with previous years.
3 Cigarette ingredients information for New Zealand and Moldova has been temporarily removed from our website, pending update of product descriptors.
4 Environmental data is reported 12 months in arrears to allow for data collection and verification.
Efficiency measures relative to tobacco production are expressed as per million cigarette equivalents MCE.
FY 2009 data covers all our manufacturing sites except non-EU cigar factories reporting for FY 2010, and excludes our logistics business aim to report for FY 2011.
5 ISO 14001 data for 2008 excludes the Altadis factories.
6 Waste data for 2007 and 2008 have been restated as a result of slight variations detected during audit and verification.
Increase in waste in 2009 was largely due to integration activities, for example factory clean-ups, construction projects and differences in reporting by Altadis.
7 We use the GHG Protocol and UK DEFRA guidelines to inform our reporting.
The reported increase in CO2 emissions in recent years reflects changes in these guidelines.
8 Community investment donations do not include value of employee time, in-kind contribution or management costs.
9 Employment indicators are under review therefore data is unavailable for FY 2010, except sickness absence data.
10 2010 sickness absence data covers the majority of employees, excluding Logistics.
11 OHS data is reported 12 months in arrears to allow for data collection and verification.
2009 data covers the majority of employees, excluding Logistics.
12 Lost time accidents are work-related accidents resulting in absence from one or more scheduled workdays or shifts.
