" The Groups theoretical weighted average tax rate, which assumes that book profits losses  "" are taxed at the statutory tax rates in the countries in which they arise, is 32% 2009: 31%."
"The book tax rate is significantly lower, largely because of the recognition of substantial deferred tax assets mainly in the US due to increased confidence in the Groups ability to "" make future taxable profit to absorb brought forward tax deductions and the fact that certain !"

Within operating cash flow there was an outflow of working capital and provisions of 59 million 2009: 133 million inflow, principally as a result of higher inventory across the Group as volumes increased.
Average working capital as a percentage of sales continued to improve from 9.2% in 2009, to 6.8% in 2010.

The impact of benefit changes gave rise to a 68 million curtailment credit which has been reported as a separate component of operating profit.
The agreement of an asset-backed cash payment arrangement resulted in the recognition of a 331 million plan asset.
Further details are provided below.
UK pensions The UK defined benefit scheme is a funded plan with all future benefits accrued on a career average basis.
A hybrid pension plan providing benefits from an element of both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements is open to new members.
Members currently in employment with the Company represent approximately 16% of total liabilities of 2,435 million 2009: 2,429 million.
The charge relating to the UK defined benefit scheme reflected in trading profit included a settlement credit of 2 million, net of expenses, relating to an enhanced transfer value exercise for deferred members of the UK scheme.
A curtailment gain of 68 million resulted from benefit changes introduced in the UK in April 2010 whereby accrued final salary benefits for active members were crystallised, whilst future revaluation will be linked to RPI compared to the previous salary increase assumption of RPI 1%.
In addition, a number of benefits were harmonised across the different sections of the UK scheme.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 30 UK PENSION ACCOUNTING DEFICIT The accounting deficit at 31 December 2010 of 71 million was significantly lower than the m 499 million at the end of 2009.
The reduction was mainly due to the 331 million special contribution provided as part of the pension partnership arrangement.
Under the partnership arrangement, the special contribution allows the UK pension scheme a distribution of !
# 30 million per annum for 20 years, subject to a funding condition and discretion exercisable by the Group.
The partnership receives rental income from various UK freehold properties and !
global trade mark royalty income see note 26 d to the financial statements for further details.
"Other changes to the accounting deficit included 147 million of gains that reflect actual ""  experience of assets and liabilities during 2010 compared to the 2009 end year assumptions, the 68 million curtailment, a 13 million reduction following changes in the statutory  !"
"minimum increase from RPI to CPI partly offset by a 100 million impact from the 30 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5.4% and 48 million from the change in mortality assumptions to a 1% underpin. """
Overseas pensions      Overseas pension obligations arose mainly in the US, Germany and Japan.
Trading profit benefited from the one-time curtailment past service credit in Japan of 6 million.
Similar actions in 2009 in the US gave rise to a 7 million credit.
GROUP POST-EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS ACCOUNTING BASIS The deficit increased by 25 million to 468 million largely as a result of discount rate m reductions in the US and Europe by 50 and 40 basis points, respectively.
"!, Retiree medical and life insurance ""# GKN operates retiree medical and life insurance arrangements in North America and has a scheme, closed to new members, in the UK."
The obligation in respect of all schemes at the end of the year was 61 million compared with !
54 million at the end of 2009 largely due to the impact of lower discount rates and changes that reflect actual experience in place of previous assumptions.
"Summary "" At 31 December 2010, the total deficit on post-employment obligations of the Group totalled  600 million 2009: 996 million, comprising the deficit on funded obligations of 193 !"
million 2009: 610 million and unfunded obligations of 407 million 2009: 386 million.
Net assets      Net assets of 1,687 million were 715 million higher than the December 2009 year end figure of 972 million.
The increase includes the 331 million impact of the pension partnership, retained profit of 325 million and currency movements of 50 million.
Financing The following section describes the way in which the Group manages and controls its treasury function and ensures it is financed in an appropriate and cost-effective manner.
Treasury management All treasury activities are co-ordinated through a central function Group Treasury, the purpose of which is to manage the financial risks of the Group and to secure short and long term funding at the minimum cost to the Group.
It operates within a framework of clearly defined Board-approved policies and procedures, including permissible funding and hedging instruments, exposure limits and a system of authorities for the approval and execution of transactions.
It operates on a cost centre basis and is not permitted to make use of financial instruments or other derivatives other than to hedge identified exposures of the Group.
Speculative use of such instruments or derivatives is not permitted.
Group Treasury prepares reports at least annually to the Board, and on a monthly basis to the Finance Director and other senior executives of the Group.
In addition, liquidity, interest rate, currency and other financial risk exposures are monitored weekly.
The overall indebtedness of the Group is reported on a weekly basis to the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
The Group Treasury function is subject to an annual internal and external review of controls.
31 Funding and liquidity The Group funds its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and borrowing facilities, including bank and capital markets borrowings and leasing.
The relative proportions of equity and borrowings are governed by specific Board-approved parameters.
These are designed to preserve prudent financial ratios, including interest, dividend and cash flow cover, whilst also minimising the overall weighted average cost of capital to the Group.
The Groups borrowing facilities are arranged by Group Treasury and the funds raised are then lent to operating subsidiaries on commercial arms length terms.
In some cases, operating subsidiaries have external borrowings, but these are supervised and controlled centrally.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through borrowing at a range of maturities.
Wherever practicable, pooling, netting or concentration techniques are employed to minimise gross debt of the Group.
At 31 December 2010, there were 10 million of drawings related to the issuance of letters of credit against the 358 million of the Groups UK committed credit facilities.
Following a 25 million bond buy-back in May 2010, capital market borrowings reduced to 526 million and include unsecured issues of 176 million 7% bonds maturing in May 2012 and 350 million 6.75% bonds maturing in October 2019.
In total, the Groups bank committed credit facilities have maturities ranging from 2011 to 2019.
The weighted average maturity profile of the Groups committed borrowing facilities was 5.3 years.
This leaves the Group well placed in the short term to withstand sudden changes in liquidity in the financial markets.
All of the Groups committed credit facilities have a single financial covenant requiring EBITDA of subsidiaries to be at least 3.5 times net financing costs.
EBITDA of subsidiaries is operating profit before restructuring charges, impairment of goodwill, amortisation of non-operating intangible assets, revaluation of financial instruments, profit and losses on sale or closures of businesses, other items reported as separate components of operating profit and depreciation, impairment and amortisation charged into trading profit.
Net financing costs exclude other financing charges and capitalised borrowing costs.
For the 12 months to 31 December 2010 this ratio stood at 13 times.
Financial resources and going concern At 31 December 2010, the Group had gross borrowings of 593 million 2009: 636 million and cash and deposits of 442 million 2009: 336 million resulting in net borrowings of 151 million.
In addition, it had available, but undrawn, committed UK borrowing facilities totalling 348 million.
Of the Groups total committed borrowing facilities, 50 million is due to expire in October 2011.
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and the Company and compared them to the level of committed available borrowing facilities.
The assessment included a review of both divisional and Group financial forecasts, financial instruments and hedging arrangements for the 15 months from the balance sheet date.
Major assumptions have been compared to external reference points such as global light vehicle volumes, build schedules from aircraft assemblers and market forecasts from major manufacturers of agricultural and construction machinery.
The forecasts show that the Group will have ample headroom in the foreseeable future and an assessment of the likelihood of breaching banking covenants in this period is considered to be remote.
Having undertaken this work, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate committed resources to fund its operations for the foreseeable future and so determine that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.
