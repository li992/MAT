Unite 08 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 drivers of student behaviour and choice.
UNITEs track record of investing only Business review incentral locations inthe strongest university cities and developing long-term continued relationships with those universities underpins the resilience of its long-term business model.
Development and investment market Land prices have been relatively stable during 2010 as the market continues to emerge from the effects of the recession, and this has allowed UNITE to make good progress building its development pipeline at an attractive return on cost.
The Group is also continuing to see opportunities to acquire additional sites in line with return hurdles.
Furthermore, given the continuing shortage of development finance, UNITE is comfortable that these opportunities will remain available for thenext six to nine months in London, during which time it expects to secure the remainder of its target pipeline, and for a longer period outside London where theCompany believes that land prices will take more time to recover.
Build cost Strong demand for USAF units inflation remains relatively benign although we expect some upward pressure inthe secondary market.
towards the end of the year.
In the investment market, activity has picked up in 2010 with investor appetite for student accommodation being strongest for prime assets throughout the year, most notably assets in London and or those subject to university agreements.
The 30m Group has also seen good demand for USAF units in the secondary market, which offer diversified direct let exposure.
Approximately 30 million of units were traded USAF units traded in the last 12 months at a small premium to NAV.
UNITE expects this demand for inlast12months prime assets and diversified direct let exposure to continue to be a feature in 2011 whilst also anticipating increased activity driven by lenders with highly leveraged exposure to the sector.
We are confident that the Groups strategy positions it to benefit from the combined impact of these market factors.
Our strategy aims to capitalise on theGroups market-leading position, national presence and stable operating platform as a basis to grow sustainable profits whilst also focusing its new capital investment on selective developments in London and other high growth markets that will further boost future earnings.
Our business Proactive asset management Operating portfolio The Group is operating 39,739 beds across 131 properties for the 2010 11 academic year and has delivered rental growth of 3.1% on a like-for-like basis and occupancy of 97%, compared with 9.7% and 96.5% respectively in 2009 10.
At the end of February 2011, reservations had been received for 62% of the portfolio, up from 59% at the same time a year earlier, reflecting a successful re-booking campaign and further improvements to the customer service platform.
From this encouraging start and the record level of applications to study in September 2011, the Group remains confident that rental growth for 2011 12 will be similar to last year.
Following the release of the Browne Review and the Higher Education Bill, the need to provide high levels of customer service and value for money will become increasingly important.
During 2010 the Group fully embedded its new operating model following the implementation of major changes in 2009.
A change programme of this scale and nature inevitably required a small period of adjustment to ensure the operating model worked as designed and these challenges have been successfully addressed.
The Group has entered the 2010 11 academic year with its operating platform delivering good quality customer service on a consistent basis.
Great Suffolk Street London Unite 09 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 The Groups maintenance operation has been brought back in house and integrated within its property management operations.
Disruption to the supply chain and service levels were successfully contained and following a systems upgrade the maintenance operation is well placed to improve its service further whilst maintaining costs in line with previous levels.
UNITE has also recently signed a contract with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games LOCOG to provide around 3,600 rooms in support of the 2012 Olympics for a period of eight weeks over the summer next year.
UNITE will be offering its customers leases of 42 weeks on the rooms being taken by LOCOG for the 2011 12 academic year.
The positive profit impact of the LOCOG contract will become clearer as operational plans are finalised and the Group will provide more clarity on this later in 2011.
Property portfolio The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio as at 31 December 2010, including its share of gross assets held in USAF and joint ventures was 884 million 31December 2009: 929 million following the sale of 146 million assets to USAF, the completion of the development assets in the joint venture with Oasis Capital Bank UNITEs share being 45 million and increases in the value of the portfolio amounting to 32 million.
The Groups development assets have been independently valued at 138 million, which includes 25 million of valuation gain that is included in adjusted net assets but not recognised in the IFRS reported net asset value.
In recent years, the Group has pursued a clear strategy to increase the proportion of its capital invested in London and other strong markets which offer the best combination of resilience and growth potential.
As a direct result of this strategy, at 31 December 2010, 38% of UNITEs investment portfolio was in London compared with 19% at December 2007.
Following the completion of its secured pipeline, set out below the proportion of the Groups assets in London will increase to approximately 50%, assuming that the new assets are retained.
The Group has also made progress stabilising its 2008 and 2009 openings, reducing its brought forward stabilising assets from 191 million at 31 December Phoenix Court Bristol Other Financial Governance Business Introduction statements information review Unite 10 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Case study new CarnegieCourt Committed to improving student experiences integrating new Carnegie Court into the University campus by engaging with students and the community members Unite 11 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Case study new Carnegie Court Students Universities employees Investors Communities In 2008, UNITE added New Carnegie Court, a520 bed building, to Aberdeen Universitys UoA Hillhead campus.
We operate thebuilding, which sits within UoAs accommodation portfolio, and the university manages tenancy agreements directly with students.
Our challenge was toseamlessly integrate our new property into UoAs existing campus infrastructure so that all students have the same experience, no matter where they live on the site.
Our local team have approached this by building a true partnership with UoA and thelocal community.
They hold weekly andmonthly meetings with the Universitys operations teams, and there is daily contact between UNITEs security operatives and theuniversitys 24-hour porters desk to foster a safe environment for students.
Welfare support for New Carnegie Court residents isprovided by the UoA team and the universitys Student Association assist the UNITE team with checking students in andout.
As a responsible landlord, we ensure that allour students are fully supported by the local emergency services and work with Grampian Fire and Rescue and the local police force, to run operational exercises with them in our properties.
We liaise with several community groups including the nearby St Gerrard Street Church, making residents aware of its non-denominational student group.

Stabilising assets typically generate two-thirds of the stabilised level of net operating income.
Rental growth was the main driver in the growth of the investment portfolio valuation.
After the expansion of yields in 2009 from 6.2% to 6.7%, property yields on student accommodation were broadly stable during 2010 and averaged 6.6%across UNITEs portfolio at the year end 31 December 2009: 6.7% following amovement of 13 basis points, the majority of which was seen in the first half of the year.
The Group completed the refurbishment of six assets in 2010 with UNITEs share of capital expenditure amounting to 3 million, and will extend this programme into 2011 and beyond to enhance the quality of the portfolio and contribute to further uplifts of value in the future.

Assets located in London and or with university agreements have traded at yields 5075 basis points lower than for provincial direct let assets, typically being sold to institutional funds or private family trusts.
Whilst a number of smaller funds have acquired direct let assets, USAF appears toremain the favoured route for institutions to gain access to direct let stock.

This may present opportunities for USAF orUNITE to acquire further stock at attractive prices.
targeted development activity Development The Group has a total secured pipeline of 4,070 beds as shown below.
Importantly, all of the 2012 schemes now have planning consents and funding in place, which provides greater certainty over the delivery of future uplifts in net asset value andprofitability.
The Group is on track to deliver 1,277 beds in 2011 on time and to budget.
The four sites, located in London, Reading, Glasgow and Manchester will be open for occupation in September 2011.

Beyond that, we intend to invest an additional 100 million to 150 million into further development opportunities over the next two to three years, to be funded from the proceeds of disposals to a similar value over the same timeframe.
The three 2010 schemes developed through the joint venture with OCB, comprising 1,129 beds, have been successfully delivered within budget and on time for the start of the 2010 11 academic year.
The schemes are 90% let for the current academic year and occupancy and rental levels are expected to stabilise over the next 12 to 24 months.
Affordability of accommodation is likely to be an increasingly important factor in our market in the coming years.
As a result, UNITE has and will continue to target its development activity towards locations and products that meet this demand.
Approximately 1,500 beds of the 201214 pipeline are focused on a lower rent offering and have been appraised at rents of less than 150 per week based on 2010 11 prices which is around 20% below the current market average.
Development funding The Group has continued to make good progress with its lenders to secure funding for its 2011 and 2012 pipeline, through a combination of existing and new facilities.
The Group also has sufficient capacity in its existing facilities to build out the secured pipeline of 2013 14 developments.
Further funding will be required to acquire and build additional schemes, but given the progress made with banks over the last two years the Group remains satisfied that it can secure new debt on terms in line with plan.
Unite Modular Solutions UMS, which manufactures and installs lightweight steel frame modular bedrooms into many of the Groups developments, has been an important part of the Groups development success given its ability to provide greater certainty over delivery time and quality, which was critical during the Groups period of rapid growth.
However, with the Groups decision to scale back development in recent years, together with the wider slowdown in construction activity, production volumes were low in 2010 and the facility has been operating well below capacity.
As a result, it made a loss of 4.8 million in 2010 2009: 1.1 million which is included in the Development Segment loss.
Production volumes did however recover in the latter part of 2010 and losses for the second half were substantially below those for the first half at 0.2 million.
