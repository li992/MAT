Group structure Group operating structure Investec is a focused, specialist bank and asset manager striving to be distinctive in all that it does.
Our strategic goals and objectives are motivated by the desire to develop an efficient and integrated business on an international scale through the active pursuit of clearly established core competencies in our principal business areas.
Our core philosophy has been to build well-defined, value-added businesses focused on serving the needs of select market niches where we can compete effectively.
We seek to maintain an appropriate balance between revenue earned from operational risk businesses and revenue earned from financial risk businesses.
This ensures that we are not over reliant on any one part of our business to sustain our activities and that we have a large recurring 22 revenue base that enables us to navigate through varying cycles and to support our long-term growth objectives.
Our current strategic objectives include increasing the proportion of our non-lending revenue base which we largely intend to achieve through the continued strengthening and development of our wealth and asset management businesses.
Against this background, we have modified our segmental reporting and divisional disclosure for the period, effectively separating out our asset and wealth management activities from our specialist banking activities.
This has not resulted in a restatement of any segmental reporting numbers but has merely altered the format of the disclosure.
