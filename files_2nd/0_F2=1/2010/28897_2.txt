REINSURANCE We maintain a conservative reinsurance programme to minimise volatility in earnings from large losses and catastrophe events.
For example, as the largest general insurer in Chile, the recent earthquake resulted in a gross loss of around 1.4bn, which was reduced to a 30m net loss through our extensive reinsurance programme.
