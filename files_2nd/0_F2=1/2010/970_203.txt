3 Mtpa groUp strategy aCtions Investing in world class assets in the most attractive commodities Our Metallurgical Coal business, with top class assets and resources of well over 3 billion tonnes, is in a strong position to capitalise on the demand for coking coals in the burgeoning Asia-Pacific markets.
Organising efficiently and effectively Longwall productivity programmes and other asset optimisation initiatives have helped increase operational effectiveness, reducing longwall move times by 50% and boosting headcount productivity by around 32% over the past two years.
Operating safely, sustainably and responsibly Metallurgical Coal is constantly exploring ways to attain zero harm in its operations: similarly, it is seeking new ways to benefit the community and the environment, such as supplying methanerich seam gas to utilities rather than flaring it, and making the Dartbrook mine a vital component of the Hunter River Restoration Project.
Employing the best people Activities such as the award winning apprentice programme at the Moranbah mine, the Operating Crews proficiency programmes assisting to deliver record productivity across Metallurgical Coal, or our flexible working arrangements are examples of our commitment to creating a business where people do make a difference.
