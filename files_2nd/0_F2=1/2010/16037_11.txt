This is centred around basic vehicle loading and unloading techniques, designed to minimise or remove the need for the driver to access the vehicle bed.
The simple principles, behind keep your feet on the ground, like many of the best ideas, were suggestions from our own drivers.
Continuing this theme, following suggestions from our own drivers, detailed testing of the lorry mounted crane grab and the bulk bags used for all our loose aggregates, has resulted in a new approach to unloading bulk bags at the customer site in 2011.
As part of the keep your feet on the ground initiative, we are investing in modifications to every crane grab so that it can be safely used to actually grab the bulk bag, and therefore remove the need to climb onto the vehicle bed to attach the bag to it.
To support this Stay Safe programme of modifying over 1,000 crane grabs, we have produced a short DVD and online quiz to supplement the safe working procedures for our drivers.
