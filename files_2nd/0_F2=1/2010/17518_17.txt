The average LME price for Outlook 2010 was $2,159 per tonne, compared with an average price of Demand for lead is expected to continue exhibiting strong growth $1,659 per tonne in 2009. predominantly due to growing demand for lead batteries, which Outlook account for 80% of global lead consumption.
Lead battery demand Global zinc demand is expected to grow in 2011, fuelled by strong is set to rise as increasingly prosperous consumers in China, India and demand in developing countries and the gradual recovery of mature other industrialising Asian countries switch from electric bicycles to economies.
Continued growth from China will drive increased zinc motorcycles and automobiles.
Battery demand is also expected to consumption from the galvanised sector and is underpinned by continue to rise from industrial vehicles and mobile equipment and vehicle production, infrastructure projects and consumer goods.

Primary and secondary lead supplies are expected to exceed consumption growth in 2011 at a modest rate, followed by a deficit thereafter as existing mines are depleted at a faster rate than new projects are commissioned.

The positive impact of higher prices, real cost savings, increased volumes, higher by-product revenues and recovery increases were partially offset by a weaker US dollar against the Australian and Canadian dollars.
The actions taken by Xstrata Zinc to improve operational productivity contributed $208 million, which included $163 million of sustainable cost savings achieved across the business.
Despite the decrease in zinc in concentrate production at Brunswick mine as a consequence of the change in its mining plan to extend its life into early 2013 and planned reduction in zinc volumes at Antamina as a result of lower grades, total zinc in concentrate production remained at a similar rate to the previous year due to the ongoing transformation of the business through expansions and productivity improvements at the Mount Isa and McArthur River operations, where zinc metal production has increased by 10%.
Lead in concentrate production increased by 3% due to increased volumes at the Mount Isa operations as production improvements that more than offset the decrease in volumes at the Brunswick mine.
Total zinc metal production decreased by 7% as a result of the closure of Kidd Creek zinc smelter in May 2010 and lead metal production was similar to the previous year.

Increased mine production enabled the Mount Isa concentrator to achieve record throughput of 8.6 million tonnes, 15% higher than Zinc Lead Australia 2009.
This increase in throughput, partially offset by lower head Operating profit from the Australian operations rose from grades, led to a 10% increase in zinc in concentrate production to $192 million in 2009 to $270 million in 2010.
