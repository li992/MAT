The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: The increase in net interest income is largely attributable to growth in the loan book and higher average lending margin in the South African business.
Net interest income continues to be negatively impacted by a decrease in arrangement fees, exit fees and deferred income as a result of lower lending activity levels, particularly in the UK Net fees and commissions continue to be negatively impacted by low activity levels Principal transactions include the revaluations and realisations of equity and warrant positions held.
The increase in principal transactions reflects the increased value of equity stakes held in the South African business Impairment losses on loans and advances have increased, largely in Ireland and South Africa, in line with expectations The increase in expenses was driven by one-off costs in the UK Trust and Fiduciary business, increased investment in deposit raising and wealth management activities and increased personnel expenses in Australia.

The management of underperforming loans remained a focus 2 The Wealth Management business continued to benefit from investment in this specialisation, resulting in increased distribution capability, a broader product platform and improved investment performance The Trust and Fiduciary business was subject to a rigorous strategic review.
This resulted in the announcement, in April 2010, of the phased closing of the Guernsey based business.
Southern Africa The second half of the financial year saw an improvement in performance as deposit margins restored to normalised levels following a significant squeeze in the first half Deposit raising became more difficult due to the sideways movement of interest rates coupled with intense competition within the market.
Growth achieved in the first half was not sustained Loan book growth remained suppressed due to lower activity levels and reduced settlements The rate at which loans moved into default slowed significantly towards the end of the period.
Australia The Professional Finance business unit experienced record lending volumes and strong lending book growth off greater penetration of core target markets of medical and accounting professionals The Growth and Acquisition Finance business unit saw muted activity levels during the year.
A strategic re-alignment of the business to a provider of integrated funding solutions to high net worth individuals and their businesses resulted in a significant improvement in pipelines towards the end of the year The withdrawal of a number of competitors from the market, the general re-pricing of risk and focused client orientation provided a unique opportunity for the Structured Property Finance business.
As a result we considered record volumes of high quality transactions to strong counterparties and have funded select transactions Limited client loss within the Wealth Management business unit through the bottom of the cycle affirmed the quality of our offering in a competitive environment.
Outlook, risks and uncertainties The business has come through the banking crisis intact.
The objectives set last year and delivered on in the current period provided a solid foundation for the Private Bank on which to build.
This will enable us to be front footed and client focused, taking advantage of identified opportunities in a much changed competitive environment We expect impairments to decrease from the high experienced during this period Critical objectives for the coming period are to: Grow and consolidate our position as a dominant player in the retail saving and deposit markets with continued investment in our product and distribution platform Grow our loan portfolio in a recovering market Realise the full benefit of the proposed Rensburg Sheppards plc acquisition as discussed on page 60 and so build our global Private Wealth Management business Manage non-performing loans and impairments as we come through the cycle Continually align our cost base and level of investment to expected future revenue Above all, to build our brand and market positioning around the entrepreneurial class delivering a specialised offering to this client base The risk of a worsening of the current economic environment remains.
This will impact activity levels, impairments and the cost of money.
