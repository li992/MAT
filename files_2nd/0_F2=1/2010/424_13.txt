exploration phase on the block.
The main reservoir objectives are the fluvial and lacustrine sands of the AJ Graben of Lower Cretaceous age, which occur in three sequences.
The A-J1 exploration well, drilled in 1989, successfully encountered oil in these sequences and tested good quality 36 API oil.
Reprocessing of 2D seismic data has since defined several other Lower Cretaceous rift graben prospects, genetically analogous to the prolific Lake Albert play in Uganda.
Further prospectivity has also been identified within a fractured basement play analogous to Yemen, which could form a secondary exploration play on the acreage.
2011 outlook The partners near term work programme 2 involves the acquisition of 350 km of new 3D seismic data, with reprocessing ofexisting 2D seismic and ongoing seismic inversion and regional biostratigraphy studies ahead of expected exploration drilling in 2012.
