co. uk Los Pelambres 60% owned Los Pelambres completed its plant expansion during Q1 2010, increasing throughput by approximately 30% from the previous 130,000 tonnes perday level up to a 175,000 tonnes per day level.
Los Pelambres is a sulphide deposit located in Chiles Coquimbo Region, 2010 240kmnorth-east of Santiago.
It produces copper concentrate containing goldand silver and molybdenum concentrate, through a milling and 384,600 8,800 79.3 otationprocess.
Payable copper tonnes Payable molybdenum Cash costs tonnes US cents per pound The plant expansion initiated in mid-2008 was successfully completed, on 124.4 excluding schedule and on budget, during the first quarter of 2010.
The additional plant by-products infrastructure, including a third SAG mill and a sixth ball mill, has increased throughput capacity to a 175,000 tonnes per day level, being the maximum annual average allowed under current environmental permits.
This results inanapproximate 30% increase in plant capacity, which on average will increaseannual production in a full year by around 90,000 tonnes of coppercompared with 2009 levels.
In 2010 Los Pelambres produced 384,600 tonnes of payable copper, 23.4%above 2009 production of 311,600 tonnes, with the increase due to the higher throughput as a result of the plant expansion.
Ore throughput averaged 159,400 tonnes per day during the year 2009 129,200 tonnes per day.
Inthe first quarter of 2010, while the plant expansion was being commissioned, throughput averaged 137,900 tonnes per day.
Following the completion of the commissioning throughput increased to an average of 172,100 tonnes per day during Q2 and Q3.
In the final quarter of the year throughput temporarily reduced to an average of 155,400 tonnes per day, mainly due to major maintenance work performed in December 2010.
Strategic Review Operational Review Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 27 Labour negotiations were concluded during November 2010 with the main union for a new 46-month labour agreement.
This maintenance work, which had originally been scheduled for 2011, included the partial replacement of the conveyor belt that transports the orefrom the mine site to the plant.
The average ore grade during 2010 wasmarginally higher than the prior year at 0.76% copper 2009 0.74%, although this was partly offset by slightly lower metallurgical recovery of90.0% 2009 92.1%.
Molybdenum production was 8,800 tonnes, a 12.8% increase on 2009.
Theincrease reected the increased plant throughput following the expansion, partly offset by a slight decrease in the molybdenum grade to0.019% 2009 0.020%.
Gold production was 35,100 ounces 2009 23,500 ounces.
Labour negotiations were satisfactorily concluded at Los Pelambres during November 2010 with the main union, which covers more than 70% of the mines employees, for a new 46-month labour agreement.
This was concluded in advance of the expiry of the existing agreement, which ran untilFebruary 2011.
Revenue at Los Pelambres in 2010 was US$3,348.3 million, 60.9% ahead of the US$2,081.5 million in 2009.
The increase reected the increase in copper and molybdenum volumes as a result of the plant expansion, and increases in both copper and molybdenum market prices.
Realised copper prices at Los Pelambres were 371.7 cents per pound, 29.6% higher than the 2009 realised price of 286.8 cents.
This largely reected the increase in the average LME price, which was 342.0 cents perpound in 2010, compared with 234.2 cents on average during 2009.
The realised copper pricesduring both 2010 and 2009 exceeded the average LME price, due tosignicant provisional pricing adjustments in bothyears, with positive adjustments of US$280.1 million in 2010, and US$380.3 million in 2009.

theincreased production volumes and realised commodity prices, partly offset Cash costs for 2010, which are stated net of by-product credits and include bythe higher on-site and shipping cash costs, as well asa US$31.0 million tolling charges, were 79.3 cents per pound, marginally below the 80.4 cents increase in depreciation as the plant expansion is now operational and a one-off for2009.
This reected an increase in on-site and shipping costs, offset by US$65.2 million charge relating to an increase inthe provision for future mine improved by-product credits due to the higher molybdenum market prices and closure costs.
The closure provision was increased following an updated production volumes.
On-site and shipping costs increased from 95.3 cents per assessment during 2010 by external consultants, with the provision increasing pound in 2009 to 106.8 cents, reecting higher energy prices, increased labour due to factors including increases in the scale of the operation, updated cost and maintenance and fuel costs as well as the impact of thestronger Chilean assumptions, and an acceleration of the timing of certain closure activities peso.
Labour costs increased largely as a result of a one-off signing bonus relating to the Quillayes tailings dam.
following the early conclusion of the labour agreement in November 2010.
Total capital expenditure during 2010 was US$215.9 million, of which Theincreased maintenance included the major work performed in December US$134.3million related to the final expenditure on the completion of the plant 2010 described above.
Tolling charges decreased slightly to 17.6 cents per expansion during the first quarter of the year.
Total expenditure on the plant pound 2009 19.2 cents, resulting in total cashcosts before by-product expansion was in line with budget at just below US$1 billion.
credits of 124.4 cents per pound 2009 114.5 cents.
28 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Operational Review Mining continued On-site and shipping costs for 2011 are forecast to be approximately 107cents per pound, similar to the 106.8 cents achieved in 2010.
Inationary pressures and other general cost increases of approximately 10cents are expected to be fully offset by a number of specic factors, including unit cost decreases resulting from the higher production levels, lower labour costs in 2011 following the recognition of the one-off labour agreement signing bonus in November 2010, and reduced energy prices as Los Pelambres enters into a two-year period under its existing energy supply agreement with a lower pricing level.
Tolling charges are also expected to remain largely stable at approximately 17 cents compared with 17.6 cents in 2010.
While the benchmark terms for 2011 have increased slightly from the 2010 level, the impact of this is mitigated by the effect of the brick system in many contracts whereby the benchmark is often averaged over two years.
Some of Los Pelambres agreements have also been settled with a slightly lower treatment charge compared with the 2011 benchmark, reecting the relatively high copper content of its concentrate.
Cash costs before by-product credits are expected, therefore, to remain largely steady at approximately 124 cents per pound compared with 124.4 cents per pound in2010.
Based on a molybdenum price of approximately US$18 per pound, by-product credits are expected to be around 45 cents per pound, compared with 45.1 cents in 2010, which would give net cash costs of approximately 79cents in 2011, compared with 79.3 cents in 2010.
As previously announced, the initial forecast for 2011 production is for approximately 419,000 tonnes of payable copper, a 9% increase compared Los Pelambres is continuing to review opportunities for further expansion.
This is based on an average plant throughput of 175,000 tonnes per Theprocessing capacity of the plant is currently limited by the existing day, given a full year of operation of the plant at the expanded capacity, and an environmental permits to an annual average of 175,000 tonnes per day.

co. uk El Tesoro 70% owned Pre-stripping of the Mirador deposit commenced in December 2010, with production from this satellite deposit expected to commence in the final quarter of 2011.
This is expected to result in reduced costs at El Tesoro while the deposit is mined in the three-year period to 2014, as well as extending ElTesoros mine life to 2022.
El Tesoro is a deposit located in Chiles Antofagasta Region, 1,350 km north of 2010 Santiago, which produces copper cathodes using a solvent-extraction electrowinning process.
It currently comprises two open pits Central and North-East 95,300 169.2 which, along with oxide ore from Esperanza, feed a heap-leach operation and Copper cathode tonnes Cash costs US cents per pound aRun-of-Mine ROM leaching operation.
The new Mirador open pit is currently undergoing pre-stripping.
Revenue at El Tesoro was US$739.7 million in 2010, a 51.7% increase on the 2009 revenues of US$487.6 million, reecting an increased realised copper price and improved volumes.
Copper cathode production was 95,300 tonnes in 2010, a 5.7% increase compared with the 90,200 tonnes produced in 2009, partly reecting the impact of the inclusion of a whole year of production from the ROM which contributed 19,200 tonnes of cathode production in 2010.
Operations at theTesoro North-East open pit were temporarily suspended in August 2010, to allow geotechnical studies to be undertaken to ensure the safety of certainwalls of that pit.
During this suspension ofoperations the Tesoro plantprocessed ore from lower grade stockpiles in place ofmaterial from theNorth-East pit.
After the completion of geotechnical studies mining resumed in some areas of the Tesoro North-East pit in November 2010.
The plant throughput relating to the heap-leach operation averaged 26,400 tonnes per day during 2010, largely in line with the 2009 throughput of 26,200 tonnes per day.
The average ore grade decreased to 1.10% in 2010, compared with 1.25% in 2009, reecting the processing of material from the lower grade stockpiles in place of the ore from the North-East pit during the temporary suspension of that operation.
30 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Operational Review Mining continued The average metallurgical recovery was also slightly lower at 71.7% 2009 For 2011, the initial forecast for cathode production is approximately 73.0%, due to the impact of lower grade feed to the plant.

Operating profit at El Tesoro was US$386.6 million, compared with El Tesoro is continuing to work to identify further oxide deposits in the district US$177.9million in 2009.
The current year results include a credit of surrounding the mine.
As explained above, the Mirador deposit will allow the US$109.4million from the reversal of the impairment originally recognised ElTesoro plant to run at close to capacity for the three-year period from atElTesoro in 2008, following a review undertaken in light of the current 2012to2014, with production of around 98,000 tonnes per year in that period.

This increase in underlying inthe Sierra Gorda District section below, El Tesoro is conducting exploration operating profit was due to the higher revenue as a result of the increased andevaluation work to identify additional resource which could help to maintain realised copper price, and improved volumes, partly offset by the increase in production at closer to capacity levels.
cash costs and higher depreciation.
Depreciation in 2010 was US$75.1 million, compared with US$52.3 million in 2009, with the increase mainly reecting increased depreciation relating to the Tesoro North-East pit.
Capital expenditure in the year was US$27.7 million, including US$2.9 million relating to the first pre-stripping costs at the Mirador deposit.
Capital expenditure is expected to increase during 2011, mainly due to remaining capital expenditure on the Mirador deposit see page 31 of approximately US$42 million, and US$14 million relating to the construction of a solar thermal plant, to provide heatfor the SX-EW plant, in addition to normal sustaining capital expenditure.
Strategic Review Operational Review Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 31 The Mirador deposit will allow the El Tesoro plant to run at close to capacity for the three-year period from 2012 to 2014, and is also expected to result in decreased costs.
Case study Mirador at El Tesoro Mirador, which also has sulphide potential, was identied by the Group in During 2010, El Tesoro approved the inclusion 2008through its ongoing exploration programme.
During 2010 El Tesoro, ofadditional material into its mine plan from the which is 70% owned by the Group, paid US$350 million to the wholly-owned Miradoroxide deposit.
The deposit, which is located Antofagasta Minerals S. A. for the right to extract the oxide ores from the Mirador deposit.
This intragroup transaction, which is eliminated in the approximately six kilometres east of Tesoro Northconsolidated Group results, was based on an independent valuation based East, contains reserves of 25.1 million tonnes of onthe estimated incremental net present value to El Tesoro of incorporating oxideore at an average grade of 1.22%, compared theoxide ores from Mirador into its mine plan.
During the year El Tesoro putinplace borrowing facilities of US$300 million to provide nancing for with the average reserve grade of the Tesoro Central thispayment.
Pre-stripping of the Mirador deposit commenced in December 2010.
There is alimited amount of overburden above the deposit, and so only a comparatively low level of pre-stripping is required, which is expected to be completed during the first nine months of 2011, with a total capital expenditure of approximately US$42 million.
Production from Mirador is expected to commence in the final quarter of 2011, with approximately 14,000 tonnes expected to be contributed to El Tesoros production in 2011.
During the following three years from 2012 to 2014, El Tesoros production is expected to come primarily from the Mirador pit.
The relatively higher grade ore which will therefore be mined during this period should allow the El Tesoro plant to operate close to full capacity with production of around 98,000 tonnes per year during this period.
The higher grade material is also expected to result in decreased costs during this three-year period.
The incorporation of the Mirador reserves into the El Tesoro mine plan has resulted in an increase of the mine life from 2019 to 2022.

co. uk Michilla 74.2% owned Michilla is continuing with work on the evaluation and recategorisation ofits resources, to allow the extension of its current mine plan, as well as additional exploration which could further extend the mine life.
Michilla has also agreed afour-year labour agreement with its main labour union, which runs until January 2015.
Michilla is a leachable sulphide and oxide deposit located in Chiles Antofagasta 2010 Region, 1,500 km north of Santiago.
It produces copper cathodes using a heap-leach and solvent-extraction electro-winning process.
The ore which 41,200 183.8 isprocessed by the Michilla plant comes from a variety of sources from Copper cathode tonnes Cash costs US cents per pound underground and open pit mines which are operated by Michilla itself, from other underground operations which are owned by Michilla and leased to third-party operators, and also material which is purchased from ENAMI, the Chilean state organisation which represents small and medium-sized mining companies.
Theprice paid for material purchased from the third-party operators or from ENAMI is in some cases linked to the market copper price.
Revenue at Michilla in 2010 was US$242.0 million, a 41.9% increase compared with 2009 revenue of US$170.5 million, as a result of a higher realised copper price, and a slight increase in volumes.
Total annual production in 2010 was 41,200 tonnes of copper cathodes, an increase on the prior year production of 40,600 tonnes.
The increase reected higher average ore grades, which offset a reduction in the plant throughput.
Average ore grades were 1.03%, compared with average grades of 0.96% in2009.
Average plant throughput decreased slightly to 14,100 tonnes per day, compared with 15,100 tonnes per day in the prior year.
In December 2010 negotiations with the main labour union, representing 90% ofMichillas workforce, were satisfactorily concluded early for a new 48-month labour agreement, commencing in January 2011.

The average realised copper price in 2010 was 263.8 cents per pound, 34.8%higher than the 2009 realised price of 195.7 cents.
This reected the increase in average LME market prices over this period, with the average LME price in 2010 of 342.0 cents per pound being 46.0% higher than the 2009 market average of 234.2 cents.
The realised copper price was lower than the average LME price in both 2010 and 2009, mainly due to realised losses on copper hedging instruments.
During 2010 realised losses ofUS$81.5 million were recognised in respect of instruments maturing during the year 2009 loss of US$45.8 million.
As a high cost operation Michilla hasover recent years often hedged a significant proportion of its production, inorder to ensure a reasonable level of return even if market prices were to weaken considerably.
Inthe year ended 31 December 2010, 32,000 tonnes oftotal production were hedged, which represented slightly under 80% of the total production of 41,200 tonnes.
Michilla has in place hedging instruments inrespect of 2011 and 2012 production, again covering approximately 80% ofexpected production.

Over its first 10 years of operations Esperanza is expected to produce on average Forecast average annual production levels approximately 190,000 tonnes of payable copper in concentrate and 230,000 over first 10 years of operation ounces of payable gold annually, signicantly increasing total Group production by approximately 25%.
The operation utilises innovative technology tominimise 190,000 230,000 its environmental impact and to optimise efficiency.
Payable copper tonnes Payable gold ounces Esperanza is a copper-gold sulphide deposit located in Chiles Antofagasta Region approximately five kilometres south of the Groups El Tesoro mine.
Itproduces copper concentrate containing gold and silver by-product credits through a conventional milling and otation process, with plant capacity ofapproximately 97,000 tonnes per day of ore throughput.
The Esperanza deposit includes an oxide resource that is part of the overburden removed through pre-stripping and which, as explained in the El Tesoro section below, isprocessed by El Tesoro through both their main heap-leach operation and alsoa specic Run-of-Mine ROM leaching operation.
Construction was substantially completed by the final quarter of 2010.
Commissioning of the plant commenced in late November 2010, and the rstshipment of copper concentrate took place on 27 January 2011 from the port of Antofagasta.
The major earthquake which occurred in Chile in February 2010 had a number of indirect impacts on the Esperanza construction during the following months, impacting both the construction workforce and also a number of key supplies.
Partly as a consequence of this, commissioning of the plant was marginally delayed compared with earlier forecasts which had envisaged the process commencing earlier in Q42010.
Ramp-up of the plant will continue through the first half of 2011, initially with one of the two ball mills in operation.
Strategic Review Operational Review Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 35 The operation utilises innovative technology tominimise its environmental impact and to optimise efficiency.
The dedicated Esperanza port facility is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2011.
As previously announced, the initial forecast for 2011 production is for approximately 159,000 tonnes of payable copper, reecting an average ore grade of 0.59%, and 286,000 ounces of gold, based on an average grade of0.37 grammes per tonne.
The forecast is based on the assumption that full design capacity is reached at the start of the second quarter and final production levels for the full year will depend on the precise timing of the completion of the ramp-up.
The current expectation is that processing at thefull design capacity of97,000 tonnes per day should be achieved during the second quarter of 2011.
Also as previously announced, the current forecast is for cash costs before by-product credits to average approximately 146 cents per pound over the course of 2011.
This average cost level reects the high costs expected during the ramp-up process, when higher than normal costs are expected tobe incurred.
Unit cost gures, stated on the basis of cents per pound of payable copper production, will also depend on the actual copper and gold production Copper production is expected to increase from 2012 with a full year of operation volumes.
The current forecast is for cash costs after by-product credits to at the maximum plant capacity, and on average over the first 10 years of the average approximately 41 cents per pound during 2011 based on agold price of mines life, Esperanza is expected to produce approximately 190,000 tonnes approximately US$1,150 per ounce, with this estimated level of by-product credit ofpayable copper annually.
The gold grade expected for 2011 is relatively high reecting the current forecast gold production volumes for 2011 detailed above.

Commitment to training and employment for local communities Esperanza has been committed from the outset of its development to providing training and employment opportunities for local communities.
Almost 1,400 local people received training supported by Esperanza as part ofthis commitment.
This included nearly 500 people who participated in foundation courses for mine operators and mine and plant maintenance.
Morethan 270 apprenticeships were created by Esperanza, of which approximately 90% were lled by local people.
In total, approximately 60% of the mines total workforce is drawn from local communities.
The mine has also focused on developing the employment of female workers, with women comprising 14% of the mines workforce, which ishigh by local industry standards.
Esperanzas achievement in this area was recognised by a special Presidential award for the development of good labour practices in respect of gender equality.

Water Esperanza is situated in the Atacama desert, one of the driest areas in the world, and water availability is one of the key constraints for the mining industry in the region.
Esperanza was designed to use two innovative technologies to address this issue the use of sea water, and the use of thickened tailings.
Esperanza will not consume any fresh water.
All of its water requirements will bemet through sea water, piped 145 kilometres from the coast, to an altitude of2,250 metres.
A small element of the mines water will be desalinated at two desalination units, located by the mines dedicated port facility and at the mine site, to provide the desalinated water required to wash the final concentrate, andalso to provide potable water for the mines workforce.
However, 90% of the mines water usage will comprise non-desalinated sea water.
The relevant mine infrastructure, such as the pipelines and plant equipment, has been specially engineered from the outset to be optimised for use with sea water.
This is the largest copper project in the world to be designed for exclusive use of sea water.
Esperanza will achieve efficient waste management through a high-density thickened tailings deposit.
This will be a global first for a large-scale copper project.
The main benefit is that it will recover more water than a comparable conventional tailings system.
Once deposited, the thickened tailings are more stable because they contain less water, and the desert conditions also allow them to solidify more quickly.
The saline quality of the water in the tailings facilitates the formation of a stable crust that substantially reduces dust, furtherreducing the environmental impact.
In recognition of this, Esperanza was awarded both the Avonni prize as one of the most innovative mining companies in Chile, and also received the Benjamn Teplizky prize in Chile, again for its innovative technology.
Automation of the mining process The operations complete process, from the mine site, through the plant, to the dedicated port facility, can be monitored and controlled from one control room.
The primary crusher is fully automated, controlled entirely from the central control room.
Similarly, it is possible to operate the loading at the dedicated portfacility remotely from the control room at the mine site.
During the testing phase a parallel control room in Santiago was available to control and monitor the operations remotely.
This automated process allows both more efficient management and control of the operation, as well as allowing detailed analysis of the efficiency of all key processes, facilitating continual improvement in the efficiency of the operation.
