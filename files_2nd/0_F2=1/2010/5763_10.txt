Benefit fraud is estimated to cost taxpayers an annual 1.1bn.
Over the past year, Experian has been working closely with the Department for Work and Pensions DWP to establish whether the Groups fraud detection products could help identify certain types of housing benefit and council tax fraud.
A pilot project was established with nine of the UKs 380 local authorities to look at 20,000 cases.
The pilot was successful in identifying hard to find fraud, such as an undeclared person living at a claimants address, and is now being extended to all local authorities.
It is estimated to achieve savings for the DWP of between 11m and 17m per year.
Experian has been working with the public sector for over 20 years, delivering significant cost benefits and efficiencies across a broad range of public services.

Until recently, the main focus has been on preventing fraud at the time of application, but with detection measures becoming more effective, fraudsters are turning their attention to existing accounts.
This can range from taking over the accounts of legitimate customers to introducing sleeping fraudsters to build up significant credit prior to defaulting.
Genuine customers, too, are increasingly resorting to fraud as a result of financial stress.
Experians Fraud Open Account Monitoring has been developed to tackle this growing threat to organisations.
The service monitors the accounts of existing customers, screening them against an array of specialist data sources, to identify potentially fraudulent activity.
Recent results have shown that as many as 2% of accounts in a typical customer portfolio reveal suspicious activity.
HSBC Insurance UK Limited, part of the HSBC Group, is one of the major organisations to use the new service.
Peter Mouratsing, IT Manager said: Open Account Monitoring is a valuable new tool for detecting increasingly sophisticated fraudsters.
It helps us to identify and investigate suspicious activity and to protect our business from the threat of identity theft.

Transnet is South Africas state-owned freight transport and logistics company, moving thousands of tons of goods each day through its rail network, pipelines and ports.
In recent years, Transnet has been engaged in a major programme of investment and has developed a growing alliance with Experian, its business information partner.
At the heart of the relationship is the Platinum Report, a report specially designed for Transnet that provides the detailed information and analysis the company needs to assess and monitor the risk profiles of its many corporate clients.
The value of this information was powerfully demonstrated at the start of the global economic crisis when Transnet asked Experian to assess the potential impact of declining turnover on the cash flow of certain key suppliers and clients.
It was a major eye opener, said Moosa Suliman, Transnet Group Credit Manager.
As a result, Experians services are now written into our credit and procurement policies.
We dont grant credit or award supplier contracts without first checking with Experian.
