Licensing IP, rather than developing it in-house, reduces both cost and risk for the semiconductor company, so ARM is developing new technology that supports a licensing plus royalty business model.

In these next few pages the ARM executive team discuss the journey the company has been on for the last two decades and how ARM may benefit as current trends unfold between now and 2020.
ARM is still a young company and, with only about 28% of processor development out-sourced, the opportunity ahead of us is far greater than what we have achieved so far.
The first ARM processor was developed by Acorn in 1985 for a low-cost PC.
Although a technical breakthrough, commercial success was limited until ARM was founded in 1990 to take the technology forward.
Twelve engineers, with some technology from Acorn and seed funding from Apple, started to look for applications that needed a low-cost, low-power embedded processor.
No one could have guessed that a new consumer product was about to take the world by storm, and that it needed a chip with a smart processor which was both low-power and cheap to build... the mobile phone.
