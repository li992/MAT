GOuNKOTO REGION The southern half of the loulo mining permit is developing into a new, significantly mineralised district.

Mineralisation is hosted in a tourmalinised greywacke with weak chlorite alteration.
Two kilometres southeast of Gounkoto is Faraba where an inferred resource of 567 000 ounces at 2.60g t has been previously delineated.

An 11 647 line kilometre airborne electromagnetic geophysical survey was flown over the senoufo Greenstone Belt in northern Cte dIvoire, covering the nielle permit and portions of the Diaouala and Fapoha permits.
The survey provided the foundation to an improved geological and structural interpretation of the belt: the resultant prospectivity analysis identified 79 new targets, of which 18 ranked high to medium and locate within a 15 kilometre radius of the Tongon plant.
The prioritisation of targets resulted in exploration programmes being performed at: seydou, Jubula, Tongon West, sekala, Belokolo and nafoun.

There is additional upside within the current SessengeKCD deposit both near surface and at depth.
The deposit comprises a series of stacked lodes, which have been labelled by their elevation: 3 000 series, 5 000 series and 9 000 series plunging moderately to the northeast.
The outlines of these lodes, rather than being limited by the extent of mineralisation, are in fact limited by drilling.

Three-dimensional modelling of the data has identified a number of northeast plunging shoots of highly conductive material that are interpreted to represent mainly graphitic carbonaceous shale.
several of these shoots are associated with areas of known mineralisation, for example at KCD and Pakaka.
The shoots are thought to represent intersections of important mineralising northeast trending s2 structures and northwest trending s1 thrusts that have exploited carbonaceous shale horizons.
Although the eM anomalies do not map actual gold mineralisation it is thought the conductive shoots highlight structurally important traps especially as they daylight coincident with gold in soil anomalies.
