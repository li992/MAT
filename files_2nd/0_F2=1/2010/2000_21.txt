24 | TRADING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW | BUSINESS REVIEW PROFIT BEFORE TAX The Groups profit before tax has reduced by 10.1 million to 110.3 million from 120.4 million last year, a decrease of 8.4%.
Three principal factors have contributed to this 10.1 million net reduction.
Operating profit has reduced by 18.6 million, net finance income of 4.4 million has been achieved against a net cost in the prior year of 3.5 million representing a net movement of 7.9 million, and there has been a reduction of 0.6 million in the Groups share of losses in joint ventures.
millon Profit before tax: 2008 09 120.4 Operating activities 18.6 Interest 7.9 Joint ventures 0.6 Profit before tax: 2009 10 110.3 Operating profit for the year of 106.2 million is down 18.6 million from 124.8 million.
This is a 14.9% reduction which is largely driven by the decrease in Group revenue.
A key feature of the results this year is that the operating margin is 17.3% which compares to 17.8% last year.
Maintaining margins at this level is a result of the decisive action during 2008 09 to reduce net operating costs, which were 60.1 million this year 2009: 75.0 million, to the right size for the underlying market.
The other important factor which will always influence margins is sales mix.
This year has seen a higher proportion of homes with lower capital values completed and a reduced contribution from our prime Central London developments, due to the timing of delivery on these schemes.
Net finance income of 4.4 million, compares against net finance costs for the year ended 30 April 2009 of 3.5 million, a net movement of 7.9 million.
The two principal reasons for the change are more finance income earned on higher average cash balances during the current financial year compared to the prior year and reduced imputed finance costs on deferred land creditors due to a lower balance and interest rates.
There has been a reduction of 0.6 million in the Groups share of losses in joint ventures which are 0.3 million this year compared to 0.9 million last year.
St Edward Homes Limited has one scheme in production Stanmore Place, where the first sales were recorded during the year and led to a small profit in the second half of the financial year.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are 60.0 pence compared to 71.3 pence last year, a reduction of 15.8%.
Of this reduction, 7.7% is due to the fall in earnings profit after tax with the remaining 8.1% reduction due to an increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue to 132,824,000 2009: 120,752,000.
