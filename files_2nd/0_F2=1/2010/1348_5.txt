7 our building blocks for growth our people our infrastructure our fleet our balance sheet strength Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 1our p eople We are a service business and we differentiate ourselves by the strength of our service offering.
Central to our service offering are our people.
We have a highly experienced team which numbered 7,200 at 30 April 2010.
The nature of our business is such that we require skilled individuals working within a highly devolved structure, in small focused teams.
Local delivery of a consistent service offering is central to our business model.
We take pride in the fact that we have a high proportion of long-serving staff and that many of our senior staff have been able to work their way up the organisation from shop floor to senior management.
We work hard, whatever the economic climate, to preserve these cultural strengths and maintain what we consider to be a key competitive advantage.
9 Our network of rental stores is one of the largest in the industry and enables us to provide nationwide coverage in the UK and now across most of the US.
While we have taken steps to rightsize the business during the recession, we believe we have maintained the local infrastructure and network required to retain and enhance our leading position in both our markets.
2 We have retained our ability to access a wide range of geographies at speed with the required equipment and accompanying operational expertise.
We expect to use this network to once again deliver good growth in our profits and strong returns when the recovery begins.
