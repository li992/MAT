The directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, refuse to register any transfer of shares not being fully paid shares provided that, where any such shares are admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis.

If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they shall send within two months after the date on which the letter of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company, to the allottee or transferee, notice of the refusal.
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, for a transfer of shares to take place.
The Articles provide that directors must give reasons for any refusal to register a transfer of shares in accordance with the Companies Act.

Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the CREST Regulations and every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or order for the time being in force concerning companies and affecting the Company, the directors may determine that any class of shares held on the branch register of members of the Company resident in South Africa or any other overseas branch register of the members of the Company may be held in uncertificated form in accordance with any system outside the UK which enables title to such shares to be evidenced and transferred without a written instrument and which is a relevant system.
The provisions of the Articles shall not apply to shares of any class which are in uncertificated form to the extent that the Articles are inconsistent with the holding of shares of that class in uncertificated form, the transfer of title to shares of that class by means of a relevant system or any provision of the CREST Regulations.

The Articles require that, following appointment to the Board, directors submit themselves for election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment.
Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold were appointed to the Board after the last AGM and, therefore, both will retire and offer themselves for election by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 13 April 2011.
The UK Corporate Governance Code provides for the annual re-election of all directors and whilst the relevant provision of the Code is intended to apply to financial years commencing on or after 29 June 2010, the Board has determined that it will adopt this provision with immediate effect and therefore each of Tim Barker, Charles Berry, Peter Emery, David Lindsell, Tony Quinlan and Dorothy Thompson will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The evaluation of the Board described on page 50 concluded that the directors offering themselves for re-election continue to demonstrate commitment to their particular role and perform effectively.
The re-election of each director is recommended by the Board.
Details of the relevant terms of appointment and service agreements appear on page 69.
Mike Grasby has stated that he intends to step down from the Board having joined Drax in December 2003 and therefore will not be seeking re-election.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 46 DIRECTORS REPORT Employees A commentary on employee involvement and the Groups commitment to its employees is set out within the Corporate and social responsibility review on pages 30 to 39 and details of employee involvement through share participation are contained in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 59 to 72.
Shares awarded under the Groups Share Incentive Plan are registered in the name of the Trustee.

Drax uses a wide variety of communication methods in order to create a common awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the Group.
For example, team briefings are held once a month where wide-ranging information is communicated throughout the organisation.
In addition, Open Forums are held three times a year and cover, inter alia, the financial and market factors affecting the performance of the Group.
Details of the communication methods used are provided in the Employees section of the report on Corporate and social responsibility on pages 36 to 37.
It is the Groups policy to give full and fair consideration to suitable applications for employment from people with disabilities having regards to their particular aptitudes and abilities.
In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training and rehabilitation is provided.
It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical with that of other employees.
The Group is committed to a policy of equal opportunities and ensures that country of origin, colour, gender, religious belief, sexual orientation, age or disability, are not barriers to working at Drax.
The Group provides a wide range of development opportunities to help employees develop the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to realise their performance potential.
Corporate and social responsibility Details of the Groups Corporate and social responsibility policies and operations are set out on pages 30 to 39.
There are Group policies in place for environment, health and safety and human resources as well as a Code of Business Ethics.
This includes processes designed to comply with the Bribery Act 2010 when it comes into force.
The internal control processes described on page 52, take account of social, environmental and ethical risks.
Charitable donations The Group has continued to support community initiatives and charitable causes.
The total charitable donations made by the Group in the year were 87,384 2009: 88,041.
More information on the charitable donations made is contained within the Corporate and social responsibility review on pages 30 to 39.
Political donations No political donations were made in the UK or elsewhere during the year 2009: nil.
It is the Boards policy not to make donations to political organisations or for political causes.
The Groups activities in the political sphere are aimed only at the promotion of its business interests.
However, the definitions of EU political expenditure are broad and there is widespread doubt about the extent to which normal business activities, which might not be thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, could be considered to be political expenditure within the meaning of the legislation.
The Board wishes to avoid any inadvertent infringement of the legislation and is, therefore, seeking the authority of shareholders to incur expenditure for the Company and its subsidiaries for such purposes of 100,000 during the next 12 months.
A resolution to that effect is contained within the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
The Board does not believe that the Group has incurred any political expenditure in the past year.
Creditor payment policy and practice Terms of payment are agreed with suppliers when negotiating each transaction and the policy is to abide by those terms and pay creditors when sums owing fall due for payment, provided that the suppliers also comply with all relevant terms and conditions.
Drax Group plc, the holding company of the Group, has no trade creditors.
In respect of Group activities, the amounts due to trade creditors at 31 December 2010 represented approximately 21 days of average daily purchases through the year 2009: 23 days.
The figure is essentially based upon the ratio of amounts owed to trade creditors against the amounts Drax was invoiced by suppliers during the financial year.
