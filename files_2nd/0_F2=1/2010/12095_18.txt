Petropavlovsk Annual Report 2010 Our Assets Pokrovskiy occurred during the late Mesozoic period.
The ore bodies consist of gold disseminations that appear to be associated with intense block Pokrovskiy Rudnik: in production since 1999 faulting which characterises the geology of this region.
There is high potential for significant mineralisation yet to be found below the dacite sill, which thus currently forms a floor to the deposit.
Some of the fractures that intersect the dacite sill are mineralised within the sill and may represent the channels through which the hydrothermal mineralising fluids travelled.
Several satellite deposits, termed the Pokrovskiy Flanks, have been identified as a result of extensive exploration work carried out by the Amur region Group.
Of these satellite deposits, Pokrovka-2 is currently in production.
Pokrovskiy Reserves and Resources The Proven and Probable Ore Reserves estimated by WAI at Pokrovskiy under the guidelines of the JORC Code 2004 and using Blagoveschensk a US$1,000 oz long-term gold price as of 1 January 2011, are 26.5Mt CHINA of ore at an average grade of 0.92g t Au economic COG of 0.3g t Au containing 0.8Moz of gold.
This includes 4.4Mt of reserves at stockpiles at an average grade of 0.63g t Au and the remaining open pit reserves Pokrovskiy is an open-pit gold mine located in the western part at both Pokrovka-1 and Pokrovka-2 areas.
Ore extraction will require of the Amur region, approximately 10km from the nearest station 87.6Mt of waste to be removed to access the ore body at a stripping on the Trans-Siberian railway and 35km from Pioneer.
Producing ratio of 3.95t t. A significant further Inferred Mineral Resource exists 144,900oz in 2010, it is one of the largest producing gold mines within the deposit.

The Group acquired the licence to explore, develop and mine the Mining and processing Pokrovskiy deposit in 1994, when it was still at a very early stage of development.
The mine became operational five years later in The current mine capacity is 1.7Mtpa for the RIP plant and 0.7Mtpa for the 1999 when heap-leach facilities were added.
The RIP processing heap-leach facilities.
The heap-leach facilities are used to treat the lower plant was commissioned in 2002 and subsequently expanded grades and operate during the warmer season, typically from April to to its current capacity of 1.7Mtpa in 2004.
To date, the Pokrovskiy November.
Production from Pokrovskiys heap-leach operations accounts mine has produced over 1.6Moz of gold.
for approximately 10% of the total annual production of the mine.
In late 2009, some production commenced from Pokrovka-2, one of the satellite deposits that lie close to the mine.
2010 Production Pokrovskiy Rudnik has excellent infrastructure and facilities, During 2010, Pokrovskiy produced 144,900oz of gold, reaching the including an electricity supply, roads, heating plant, laboratory, upper end of the Groups production forecast for Pokrovskiy for the year accommodation, canteen and offices.
This can be attributed to the mining and comprehensive mining fleet, including trucks, bulldozers, shovels processing of reserve grades that were higher than predicted.
the first half of the year, the majority of production at Pokrovskiy came from lower grade ore bodies at the Pokrovka-1 and Pokrovka-2 deposits.
This allowed the Group to focus on extensive stripping works Geology in the main Pokrovskiy pit in order to access higher grade material of Pokrovskiy Rudnik is located on the south side of the Mongolo- 3.0-3.5g t Au, which was processed during the second half of the year Okhotskiy regional belt, the boundary between two tectonic plates in accordance with the Groups mine plan.
These stripping works also which collided during the early Cretaceous period, approximately allowed the stabilisation of the southern wall of the main Pokrovskiy pit, 150 million years ago.
The Pokrovskiy deposit consists of a set of five which experienced movement in the end of 2009. large, irregular, but mostly flat-lying ore bodies.
Mineralisation at Pokrovskiy is associated with hydrothermal volcanic activity that 36 37 Overview Performance Petropavlovsk Annual Report 2010 Pokrovskiy: key facts Mine type: Hard-rock gold mine with silver Commercial start-up: First acquired in 1994 by-product, mining exclusively by open pit methods and commissioned in 1999, more than 1.6Moz accumulated production Location: Western part of the Amur region, approximately 10km from the Trans-Siberian Milling Capacity: 1.7Mtpa RIP processing railway and 30km from Pioneer plant plus 0.7Mtpa heap-leach operations Ownership: Licence owned by 98.61% Group 2010 Production: 144,900oz subsidiary OJSC Pokrovskiy Rudnik, production 2010 Cash costs: US$564 oz is 100% attributable 2 Total project area: 367.1km Pokrovskiy mining operations Year ended Year ended Units 31 Dec 2010 31 Dec 2009 Total material moved m 000 6,209 5,445 Ore mined t 000 1,706 Average grade g t 2.4 2.7 Gold mined oz 000 131.3 161 Pokrovskiy processing operations Year ended Year ended Units 31 Dec 2010 31 Dec 2009 RIP Plant Total milled t 000 1,760 1,782 Average grade g t 2.7 3.8 Gold content oz 000 152.5 218 Recovery rate % 84.8 84.6 Contained gold oz 000 129.3 184.6 Heap Leach Ore stacked t 000 742 770 Average grade g t 0.9 0.9 Gold content oz 000 22.2 22 Recovery rate % 70.2 67.3 Contained gold oz 000 15.6 15.0 Total Gold production oz 000 144.9 199.6 including Pokrovskiy oz 000 144.9 190.1 Pioneer oz 000 9.5 During 2009, some of the ore from the Pioneer deposit was processed through the Pokrovskiy mill, yielding 9,500oz of gold.

This increase compared to the 2009 figures was in line with the Groups By 2013, the Group is planning to install a pressure oxidation POX expectations and was attributable to the processing of lower grade ore facility at the Pokrovskiy site to process flotation concentrate from combined with the fluctuation of the Rouble Dollar exchange rates, Malomir and Pioneer.
A full feasibility study has been commissioned with increased prices for diesel, electricity and for other consumables.
detailed results of the study expected to be announced in the second quarter of 2011.
Outlook The focus of exploration works in 2011 within the Pokrovskiy licence area Total production from Pokrovskiy for 2011 is expected to be is to define ore reserves of previously identified resources of refractory ore c. 96,200oz.
The life of the main open pit, previously expected to be which will be suitable for treatment at the future POX plant.
exhausted by the end of 2012, has now been prolonged as the result of identification of the additional ore reserves.
Nevertheless, production will gradually shift to the Pokrovskiy Flanks, from where it is currently estimated to continue for many years.
