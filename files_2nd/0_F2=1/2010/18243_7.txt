In the UK the supply of medium and long term finance was restricted and in the circumstances we felt it prudent to husband our resources in order to fund our forthcoming development projects which over the next two years are anticipated to absorb some 70 million.
Recently there has been some slight easing in the availability of term finance although the fees and margins sought for new facilities remain at historically high levels.
In the USA, however, the market is more liquid and we were able to secure and finance a 256 apartment complex in Tampa, Florida for $14.95 million.
Improvement works to the complex are planned with a view to enhancing occupancy and rental income.
