Our extensive knowledge of advanced materials has enabled us to develop solutions for complex applications which provide increased performance, efficiency and sustainability.
Energy harvesting We worked with Glyndwr University, Wales to design and build a successful prototype of an energy harvesting system.
The system used piezoelectric devices connected to a mat to collect and store energy from footfall for reuse a technology which has considerable potential for generating renewable energy at major events and in public and private buildings.
5W h 2 Can be generated from 1m of floor area with busy footfall.
12 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2010 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Chip production The challenge in semiconductor production is to fit more transistors into a smaller area.
To achieve this, manufacturers use a pad to flatten wafers between layers, which then has to be cleaned using diamond grit to remove unwanted material.
Our Phoenix pad diamond conditioners improve waste material removal while minimising pad damage.
This significantly improves productivity, resulting in more wafers produced per day, while reducing consumable expenses for chip manufacturers.
30% In laboratory tests, our conditioners achieved a 30% higher waste material removal rate.
