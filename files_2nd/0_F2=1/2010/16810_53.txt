Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2010 59 Directors remuneration continued Details of the GLTI performance shares The number of shares vesting depends on the performance of two measures: free cash flow and relative TSR.
This section sets out how the performance of each of the two measures is calculated.
Underlying operational performance adjusted free cash flow The free cash flow performance is based on a three year cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure.
The definition of adjusted free cash flow is reported free cash flow excluding: Verizon Wireless additional distributions: Foreign exchange movements over the performance period: and Material one-off tax settlements.
The cumulative adjusted free cash flow target and range for awards in the 2011, 2010 and 2009 financial years are set out in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Vesting Vesting Vesting Performance bn percentage bn percentage bn percentage Threshold 17.50 50% 15.50 50% 15.50 50% Target 20.50 100% 18.00 100% 17.50 100% Superior 21.75 150% 19.25 150% 18.50 150% Maximum 23.00 200% 20.50 200% 19.50 200% The target free cash flow level is set by reference to the Companys three year plan and market expectations.
The Remuneration Committee consider the 2011, 2010 and 2009 targets to be stretching ones.
TSR out-performance of a peer group median We have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile.
As such, the out-performance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure.
The peer group for the performance condition for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 financial years is: BT Group: Deutsche Telekom: France Telecom: Telecom Italia: Telefonica: and Emerging market composite consists of the average TSR performance of Bharti, MTN and Turkcell.
The relative TSR position will determine the performance multiplier.
This will be applied to the free cash flow vesting percentage.
There will be no multiplier until TSR performance exceeds median.
Above median the following table will apply to the 2011, 2010 and 2009 financial years with linear interpolation between points : Outperformance of peer group median Multiplier Median 0.0% p. a.
1.5 times 80th percentile upper quintile 9.0% p. a.
2.0 times The performance measure has been calibrated using statistical techniques.
Combined vesting matrix The combination of the two performance measures gives a combined vesting matrix as follows: TSR performance Free cash flow measure Up to median 65th 80th Threshold 50% 75% 100% Target 100% 150% 200% Superior 150% 225% 300% Maximum 200% 300% 400% The combined vesting percentages are applied to the target number of shares granted.
The free cash flow performance is externally verified and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance assessment in respect of the TSR out-performance of a peer group median is undertaken by  LLP.
