12 OUR STRATEGY IN ACTION Powder Metallurgy GKN Powder Metallurgy comprises GKN Sinter Metals, the worlds largest manufacturer of sintered components, and Hoeganaes, which produces metal powder used in the manufacture of these components.
Powder metallurgy is an enabling technology that is delivering smaller, lighter, and higher performing products Challenging Concepts Case Study Sinter-forged differential gears continue to expand the potential of powder metal technology Differential gears are used to distribute torque between two wheels or axles running at different speeds.
The differential is a critical system which operates in an increasingly high stress, space-constrained environment.
Sinter-forged differential gears deliver weight savings and consistently higher performance than established gear technologies.
The result is a product that reduces driveline rotating mass and system size both essential elements for future vehicle designs.
These benefits directly translate into lower fuel consumption and CO emissions as well as 2 improved vehicle dynamic response.
