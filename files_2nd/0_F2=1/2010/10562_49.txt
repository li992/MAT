Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report continued Base salary The base salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and having regard to practice in companies of comparable size and complexity in the FTSE 350.
Salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis.
In line with the approach being taken across the organisation, executive Directors salaries will be increased in 2011.
In considering the level of increase, the Committee has been mindful of the general level of increase across the Group as well as the positioning of roles against the market.
The table below shows the salaries in 2010 and with effect from 1 January 2011.
During the year, Andrew Hosty was promoted to the Board as CEO Morgan Ceramics.
His base salary from appointment to the Board was 300,000 and will be increased to 305,000 from 1 January 2011.

Base salary is the only element of the remuneration package that is pensionable.
Annual bonus The targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the shortand long-term requirements of the Company.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets.
The bonus scheme provides the opportunity for executive Directors to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary if stretching performance targets are achieved.
For 2010, the bonus for the CEO and CFO was based on Group profit before taxation and amortisation.
The targets were set to incentivise the executive Directors to manage much more of the income statement to improve the earnings per share of the Group.
For 2011, the annual bonus will again be based 100% on the achievement of Group profit before tax and amortisation targets.
For 2010, the bonus for the CEO Morgan Ceramics was balanced between the performance of the Technical Ceramics Division and the Group as a whole, comprising Group profit before tax and amortisation 20%, Technical Ceramics EBITA 40% and Technical Ceramics cash conversion 40%.
For 2011, his bonus will be based on Group profit before taxation and amortisation 30%, Morgan Ceramics EBITA 50% and Morgan Ceramics third party working capital to sales % 20%.
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made the Committee also takes into account the quality of the overall performance of the Company.
The bonuses awarded to executive Directors in respect of 2010 were as follows: Mark Robertshaw 100% of salary 2009: 20%.
The awards for the CEO and CFO were made on the basis that in 2010 the maximum Group profit before tax and amortisation target was achieved resulting in a bonus payment of 100% of salary.
The award for the CEO Morgan Ceramics also reflected performance against the Group profit before tax and amortisation target together with a Technical Ceramics EBITA target achieved at the maximum performance level and a Technical Ceramics cash target achieved at the maximum level, resulting in a bonus payment of 100% of salary.
Long-term incentive arrangements The Committee believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives helps align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Accordingly the Company operates a number of share schemes for the executive Directors and other senior employees, details of which are set out below.
