74 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW: Iron Ore and Manganese continued Projects The development of the 9 Mtpa Kolomela Mine is well advanced and overall project progress reached 81% as at 31 December 2010.
The project remains on budget and on schedule to deliver initial production at the end of the first half of 2012, ramping up to full capacity in 2013.
To date, 22.6 Mt of waste material has been moved, 18.6 Mt of it during 2010.
Capital expenditure of $679 million excluding capitalised costs for pre-strip waste removal has been incurred to date, with $307million incurred during 2010.
Significant progress has been made at the Minas-Rio project in Brazil, expected to produce 26.5 Mtpa in its first phase.
The award of the second part of the mine, beneficiation plant and tailings dam installation licence LI part 2 in December 2010, being the final primary installation licence, supports the start of the civil works for the beneficiation plant and tailings dam construction in March 2011, after the rainy season.
This licence followed the award of the mining permit in August 2010.
As previously stated, it should take between 27and 30 months from commencement of these works to construct and commission the mine and plant, complete the project and deliver the first ore on ship: however, there are still a number of other licences and permits to be obtained during this period.
Anglo American also reached agreement on a fixed 25-year iron ore port tariff with its port partner, LLX SA, in relation to the LLX Minas-Rio LLX MR iron ore port facility at Au.
The iron ore volumes associated with the first phase of the project will be subject to a net port tariff of approximately $5.15 per tonne in 2013 terms after taking into account AngloAmericans shareholding in LLX MR $7.10 per tonne gross.
As part of the agreement to secure the long term tariff arrangements, Anglo American has agreed to fund a greater share of the development cost of the first phase of the port.
This agreement is expected to result in additional capital expenditure attributable to AngloAmerican of approximately $525 million in relation to the port.
