The company intends to fulfil a long term contract with its sole remaining customer, a power generator located in northwest Colorado.
This contract expires at the end of 2017.
In the absence of divestment or the development of additional customers, the expiration of the contract will be followed by closure and completion of reclamation of the mine site.
Development projects The Energy groups main coal development project in Australia is the extension of the Kestrel mine with first production expected in early 2013.
A feasibility study commenced in November 2010 for the Mount Pleasant project, an already consented, open cut thermal coal mine proposal in the Upper Hunter Valley.
Consent modifications are being sought to provide options that may reduce capital costs and allow more efficient operations.
In New South Wales, the start of a long term commercial framework relating to port capacity to facilitate industry growth is showing results.
To date the framework has seen coal producer nominations and the allocation process trigger the requirement for PWCS to take its terminal capacity to 145 million tonnes a year mtpa, expected by 2013.
The process has also triggered the requirement for PWCS to develop a fourth terminal.
Meanwhile, the externally owned and operated Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group commissioned its stage one 30mtpa terminal in April 2010 and has announced financial close on an expansion to take its port capacity to 53mtpa.
Negotiations on below-rail arrangements in the Hunter Valley region are continuing.
