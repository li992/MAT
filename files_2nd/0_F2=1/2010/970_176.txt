FinanCial overview Nickels main use is as an alloying metal, along with chromium and other metals, in the Nickel generated an operating profit of production of stainless and heat resistant $96million, following a year of much improved steel.
Approximately 66% of nickel is used to nickel prices.
Nickels operating profit was manufacture stainless steel and around 25% net of $11 million of costs relating to in other steel and non-ferrous alloys.
