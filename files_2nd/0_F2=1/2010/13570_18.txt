Flight testing of the BR725 for the new Gulfstream G650 progressed well and has now achieved 1,000 hours.
The Trent 1000 flight test programme for the Boeing 787 continued, although Boeing announced in early 2011 that the entry into service for the aircraft would be further delayed until later in 2011.
The Groups engineering and technology activities are undertaken by close to 10,000 product, engineering and technology specialists 2010 also brought a number of challenges to the civil aerospace covering more than 40 major programmes.
The activity is global with business.
The eruption of a volcano in iceland in April 2010 resulted in main engineering centres located in the UK, Us, Germany, the Nordic significant disruption to the aviation industry.
Our engineering team countries, singapore and india.
took a leading role and worked in a systematic way to assist the airlines and industry regulators on this issue.
Towards the end of 2010, a research Trent 900 suffered a high-profile failure on a Qantas Airbus A380, which Our advanced research is supported through our worldwide network of initiated a significant and urgent response from the engineering team in 28 Rolls-Royce University Technology Centres, working across a range of order to return to normal operations.
specialist subject areas such as materials, noise, vibration and combustion.
Two new centres for nuclear technology at imperial College Marine london and at the University of Manchester were added during the year.
in 2010, the marine business acquired ODiM and we have successfully integrated the engineers of this business into the Rolls-Royce engineering During 2010, we strengthened our new Advanced Technology Centre community.
ODiMs people have a wealth of skills and technological ATC in singapore which is developing manufacturing and electrical knowledge.
We anticipate the acquisition will enhance our offshore systems and high-power computing capabilities.
Work began on the capability significantly.
Marine sold the first offshore vessel with a new, dedicated home for the ATC as part of the seletar development.
wave-piercing design UT 754 WP for delivery in 2012 and the Dynamic We opened our new Mechanical Test Operations Centre in Dahlewitz, Positioning Release 3 DP3 successfully passed concept design review.
This centre provides mechanical testing capability for all areas of the Group.
Building on the success of our Defence aerospace membership of the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre AMRC, in defence aerospace, the sTOVl variant of the lockheed Martin F-35 we continue to increase our focus on advanced manufacturing.
in the lightning ii, equipped with the Rolls-Royce liftsystem, successfully UK, we opened the Advanced Fabrication Research Centre at completed a flawless first hover and vertical landing in March 2010.
The strathclyde, scotland, and the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing pace of the F136 engine development programme accelerated Research Centre project was launched.
We are also establishing the significantly during 2010 with six new test engines delivered during the Commonwealth Centre for Advanced Manufacturing CCAM at the year.
Approximately 900 test hours were completed according to plan Crosspointe complex in the Commonwealth of Virginia, UsA.
The programme also continued its successful history of meeting contractual milestones with the first sTOVl in 2010, we established the Manufacturing Technology Centre MTC in propulsion system delivered to test, on time.
MTC will be the largest in the network of AMRCs when it opens in 2011.
Technology programmes in the areas of high integrity libertyWorks in indianapolis continues to perform well on the ADVENT joining, intelligent automation, advanced fixturing and net shape demonstrator programme: rig testing demonstrated fan performance powder manufacture have already been launched through MTC as expected and with a favourable stability margin.
Work continues partnerships with founder members Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Aero in preparation for the core and engine demonstrator phases of Engine Controls.
environmental performance in 2010, Robinson Helicopter obtained FAA certification for the Further improving the environmental performance of our products and RR300-powered R66 helicopter and commenced customer deliveries.
operations is a key driver for research and development in Rolls-Royce.
We completed the first build of the Environmentally Friendly Engine, and energy the second build of our mid-size technology demonstrator engine, E3E, We continue to develop our business activities in the civil nuclear market was tested successfully in Germany.
The E3E, two-shaft core and also continued with further investment in nuclear engineers and demonstrated, amongst other successes, critical operability throughout in infrastructure.
the flight envelope up to 38,000ft, for the novel lean-burn combustor.
Our first tidal stream generator was deployed offshore of the Orkney The European sTREAMliNE programme led by Rolls-Royce was launched islands.
A major milestone was reached on November 10, 2010 when the in 2010.
The project includes 22 partners in eight countries and focuses turbine generated 500kW at full power for the first time at the test site.
on demonstrating radical new marine propulsion concepts, aimed at The turbine is now being operated unrestricted with several periods of delivering increases in efficiency of at least 15 per cent.
We achieved fully automatic 24-hour operation and has achieved all requirements to notable engineering successes in each of our key business sectors gain a renewable obligation certificate.
