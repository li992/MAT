THE GROUP COMPANY Chairmans Statement Peter Salsbury BSc Chairman 10 June 2010 Introduction In my interim report I noted that, between March and September 2009, UK and European property share prices had risen with record speed.
Since September, prices have broadly moved sideways waiting for gradually improving fundamentals of the direct market to catch up with share ratings.
Over the year both share classes underperformed the benchmark in terms of NAV total return performance chiefly due to investing their cash holdings with greater circumspection than was subsequently justified.
At the share price total return level the Ordinary share class performance was in line with benchmark and the Sigma performance well ahead of its benchmark, thanks to a decline in the discount to NAV at which the shares have traded.
Each managers report goes into greater detail regarding relative performance last year.
Since September both share classes have been fully invested and utilising a modest level of borrowed money.
While noting the underperformance, I think it fair to draw shareholders attention to the table on page 5 which shows the record of the managers over an extended period continues to be excellent.
Chris Turner has decided to retire in July 2011 following the Annual General Meeting.
He has been Senior Fund Manager since 1995.
He will continue in his current role as Senior Fund Manager with day to day responsibility for the Ordinary Share Class until 31 March 2011.
Chris has recommended that Marcus Phayre-Mudge takes over as Fund Manager for the Ordinary Share Class from 1 April 2011 and be appointed as Senior Fund Manager when he retires in July 2011.
He has also proposed that James Wilkinson becomes Fund Manager for the Sigma Share Class from 1 April 2011.
