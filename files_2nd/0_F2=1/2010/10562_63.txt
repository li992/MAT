Investment shares represent those shares acquired with a portion of the bonus set out in the emoluments table on page 83 voluntarily deferred into the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan.
This is the maximum number of shares based on the pre-tax value of the deferred shares that could be earned at the end of the performance period if the performance condition set out on page 79 is met in full.
In 2008 the Executive Directors deferred their bonus payment on a gross basis and in 2009 and 2010 deferral was on a net basis.
In 2011 deferral will be on a gross basis.
The flexibility to defer on either basis is within the Plan rules.
M atching awards granted to Executive Directors in 2008 and 2010 are subject to three-year EPS growth.
The EPS target requires three-year EPS growth of RPI 4% pa for a 0.25x match, RPI 5% pa for a 0.5x match, RPI 7.5% pa for a 1x match, RPI 10% pa for a 1.75x match and RPI 15% pa or higher for a 3x match.
There is straight-line vesting between these points.
Matching awards granted to Executive Directors in 2009 are subject to 3-year EPS growth.
The EPS target requires three-year EPS growth of 4% pa for a 0.25x match, 5% pa for a 0.5x match, 7.5% pa for a 1x match, 10% pa for a 1.75x match and 15% pa or higher for a 3x match.
The performance targets for awards made in 2009 did not reference growth above RPI.
Given the difficult economic climate at that time the Committee considered the targets to be stretching.
Note: Prior to 6 April 2010, the Committee amended the terms of the 2008 Investment shares, in line with the plan rules, to allow individuals to crystallise the tax due on their earned deferred bonus awards.
This decision has not resulted in any additional costs to the Company.
The net value of these awards will continue to be held until the normal vesting date.
No amendment has been made to the terms of the matching shares.
