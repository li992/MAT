Business Review Our Marketplace BBA Aviation provides aviation support and aftermarket services across three key markets business and general aviation, commercial and military.
Business and General Aviation The Business and General Aviation B&GA market accounts for approximately two thirds of our revenue.
InSignature, we principally focus on business jets but in our Aftermarket Services and Systems business as well as jets we also support turbo prop powered fi xed-wing aircraft and civil helicopters.
Worldwide there are more than 16,000 jets, 12,000 turbo props and some 17,000 civil helicopters in operation.
Following a period of unprecedented growth in deliveries of turbine powered B&GA aircraft and in the utilisation of the B&GA fl fleet up to 2008, in 2009 and 2010 there was a sharp reduction in business jet and turboprop deliveries, and in B&GA fl ying hours.
Original equipment manufacturers OEMs saw substantial cancellations of orders for new jets and, at the same time, the inventories of used business jets increased to historically high levels while prices for these jets tumbled.
Since our business model is based on supporting the in-service fl fleet of aircraft, for the most part we have not been directly aff ected by the reduction in new aircraft deliveries as even at the current low level of new jet deliveries, the overall fl fleet continues to grow.
Whilst we are not aff ected by the reduction in delivery of new aircraft, we were aff ected by the reduction in fl ying hours.
Having reached a peak in 2007, over the course of 2008 and 2009 US fl ight activity fell by more than 30%, reaching a low point in the second quarter of 2009 before showing sequential improvement and eventually returning to growth for the fi first time in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Cyclical recovery continued into 2010 with every month showing growth over the same month in the previous year.
For 2010 as a whole the North American B&GA market grew by 10%.
At the end of 2010 the market remained 21% below the 2007 peak.
Industry forecasters now expect recovery in new aircraft sales to begin in 2012 with a return to pre-recession levels by 2016, with approximately 10,000 new business jets expected to be delivered during 2011-19.
This is one of the indicators that supports our confi dence in the growth of this market over the longterm.

Makers of long range jets, notably Gulfstream and Bombardier, are preparing to answer the needs of the emerging markets with the arrival of the new Gulfstream 650 during 2012 and the Bombardier Global 7000 and 8000 which are due in 2016 17.
However, North America and Europe will continue to be the predominant users of B&GA aircraft for the foreseeable future, accounting today for some 80% of all aircraft in operation and a greater proportion of fl ying hours.
B&GA is a key effi ciency and productivity tool.
Travel via commercial airlines continue to be subject to long delay and ineffi ciency from security protocols, crowded airport terminals and limited routing options.
The security, privacy and fl exibility of B&GA travel continues to be attractive to both individuals and corporations where time is a valued commodity.
Business models for the usage and ownership of B&GA aircraft continue to be developed, making B&GA ever more aff ordable and accessible.
The prevalence of these fundamental growth drivers further supports the continued structural growth of the industry, coupled with the ongoing cyclical recovery of B&GA fl yinghours.
Excludes airline and regional jets used for business Commercial Aviation Our commercial aviation business is focused on providing ground support services including refuelling, baggage handling and technical services to commercial airlines around the globe.
Our primary growth driver in this market is commercial aviation movements.
2010 proved to be a year of rapid recovery for the worlds airlines after suff ering a decline in passenger volumes in 2009 and consequent decline in revenues and continued operating losses.
Passenger numbers increased throughout 2010 but commercial aircraft movements in the USA for the year as a whole remained fl at as careful management by airlines caused yields to improve dramatically.
For 2011 we expect to see modest growth in movements in both the USA and Europe, and somewhat stronger growth in the Asia Pacifi c region.
Market forecasters predict a global growth rate of 2.8% p. a. in commercial aviation movements for the 2010-29 period with the highest growth rates in the Asia Pacifi c region.
We continue to see favourable outsourcing trends as commercial airlines, particularly in the more mature markets, increasingly regard services such as ground handling and into plane refuelling as non-core.
Military Aviation In the military market our business is focused primarily on the aftermarket support of legacy military platforms.
While delivering fl at to slight increases in spending for 2010, US and European defence budgets are under considerable downward pressure as governments look to reduce defi cits.
The US Secretary of Defense has proposed major cuts over a fi five year period and similar proposals are expected in the UK and elsewhere inthe EU.
We expect to see the majority of these cuts focused on the procurement of new platforms and an improved platform effi ciency.
This is likely to lead to the extension of service lives of selected legacy platforms and to the outsourcing of support and supply chain services.
This is likely to be positive for our business as we continue to support the extended lives of the in-service fl fleet and as the OEM warranty support for the ageing fl fleet expires.
