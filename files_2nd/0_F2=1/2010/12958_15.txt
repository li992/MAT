testwork completed has shown pressure oxidation to be very effective in releasing the gold from the sulphides.
The Randgold owns 83.25% of the project with a local company, process requires flotation of the sulphides to a concentrate Compagnie senegalaise fide Transports Transatlantiques and processing of the concentrate through a high pressure Afrique fide lOuest CssTAO, holding 6.75% and the state and temperature chamber which oxidises the sulphides of senegal currently having a non-contributory 10% share following which the oxidised ore is then processed through of any mine developed on the property.

Prefeasibility study A prefeasibility study was completed MASSAWA SATELLITE DEPOSITS on the open pit mineral reserve and reported on last year.
This highlighted the refractory nature of the ore at Massawa and thus a full geochemical and metallurgical characterisation of the ore, including quantitative gold deportment analysis, was undertaken.
Together with additional geological logging information this confirmed the existence of two distinct metallurgical domains that correlate well with the mineralisation styles identified.
The late high grade domain sample contained 66% free gold, with the remainder being contained within sulphide.
The broader disseminated sulphide domain has minimal free gold with the majority of gold found within the sulphides.
The gold associated with the sulphides in both domains is predominantly in solid solution and is found within arsenopyrite Randgold Resources 44 Annual report 2010 MASSAWA RESOuRCES AND RESERvES Attributable gold Tonnes Grade Gold Moz Moz Mt Mt g t g t Moz Moz 83% 83% at 31 December Category 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Mineral resources Open pit Indicated 34.87 17.43 2.77 4.16 3.11 2.33 2.59 1.94 Inferred 1.09 - 3.37 0.12 0.10 - Underground Inferred 2.33 6.24 4.18 3.39 0.31 0.68 0.26 0.57 TOTAl MIneRAl ResOURCes Indicated 34.87 17.43 2.77 4.16 3.11 2.33 2.59 1.94 Inferred 3.42 6.24 3.92 3.39 0.43 0.68 0.36 0.57 Mineral reserves Open pit Probable 17.42 10.51 3.36 4.62 1.88 1.56 1.56 1.30 TOTAl MIneRAl ReseRves Proven and probable 17.42 10.51 3.36 4.62 1.88 1.56 1.57 1.30 Open pit mineral resources are the insitu mineral resources falling within the US$1 200 oz pit shell reported at a 0.5g t cut-off.
