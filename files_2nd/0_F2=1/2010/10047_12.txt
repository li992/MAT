Further challenges lie ahead in 2011 but with global GDP growth likely to bounce back to around 4% and the recovery in our civil aerospace and energy markets strengthening, subject to any further economic shocks Meggitt is well-placed to deliver annual organic growth of around 6 to 7% over the next five years.
