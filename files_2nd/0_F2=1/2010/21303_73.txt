Exposure relating to derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, stock borrowing and loan transactions is calculated using internal FSA approved models.
These are used as the basis to assess both regulatory capital and capital appetite and are managed on a daily basis.
The methodology encompasses all relevant factors to enable the current value to be calculated and the future value to be estimated, for example: current market rates, market volatility and legal documentation including collateral rights.
