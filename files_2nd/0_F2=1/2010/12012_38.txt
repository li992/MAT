2 These awards relate to the Companys Performance and Co-investment Plan PCP which succeeded the RSP in 2007.
Details of the PCP and the performance conditions applicable to these Awards are set out in section iii Long-Term Incentive Plan on page 42 of this report.
None of the 2006 RSP Award vested in September 2009 because the performance criterion had not been met.
The Award therefore lapsed in its entirety.
The performance criterion applicable to this Award was: the total shareholder return TSR achieved by the Company in the performance period must be greater than that of the company at or nearest to but not above the 50th percentile position of the comparator group.
If the TSR performance condition had been met then 50% of an award would have vested with 100% vesting if the Company had achieved the position equal or closest to, but not above, the 75th percentile position of the comparator group.
The achievement of a position between the 50th and the 75th percentile positions would have resulted in vesting in steps reflecting the number of companies within that third quartile of the comparator group.
The comparator group consisted of nine of the water only, water and sewerage, electricity and gas companies in the FTSE Utilities Index and quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
The TSR of each company in the comparator group was measured by Hewitt Associates Limited assuming that all dividends were reinvested and was calculated by taking the average market value of each companys shares for the whole of March before the beginning of the relevant three-year performance period and comparing this to the average market value of the same shares for the whole of March at the end of the three-year period.
Based upon independent remuneration consultants advice this method of measurement was considered to be fair and transparent to participants in the Plan and also an accurate measure of actual performance.
the above performance criterion was chosen by the Remuneration Committee because it was considered to be an appropriate measure of the Groups performance which also aligned itself to the interests of shareholders.
During the year the Directors received dividends on the above shares in accordance with the conditions of the RSP as follows: Colin Drummond 8,686: David Dupont 8,686: Chris Loughlin 7,580.
As the 2006 rsP Award was the final award made pursuant to that Plan having been replaced in 2007 with the Performance and co-investment Plan no further dividends pursuant to the RSP will be payable to the Directors.
