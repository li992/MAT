Mining Exploration Technological Project Development, Support Engineering & Processing & Construction Focus on Mining & Processing Petropavlovsk has enjoyed an unprecedented rate of growth since the Group was founded in 1994 and I have been lucky to have been with the Group since the very beginning.
In 1994 Pokrovskiy Rudnik had a workforce of just over 17 people.
Now the Group employs over 11,000 people!
Over the years we have learnt a lot and this knowledge has enabled us to significantly speed up the process of bringing our deposits into production.
We have research and development centres in place to ensure that we are able to select the most optimal technology to extract gold from different types of ore.
Through the research work performed by our design institutes, we are now able to process refractory ores.
We believe that due to the continuous process of active exploration our Group has a bright future.
