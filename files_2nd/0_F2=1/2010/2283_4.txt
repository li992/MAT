on solid Foundations - a CoMponent journey transmission shafts transmission shafts form part of the drivetrain of all vehicles.
in this example, we will look at how these hard working components are given a longer lifetime as part of powerful construction vehicles, such as excavators, through heat treatment and metal joining processes.
transmission shafts are an excellent example of thermal processings the forged steel part contribution to value engineering.
is then machined into the electron beam welding ebw its near net shaft process, in particular, allows the shape and sent for fabrication of a high performance heat treatment component from two pieces, thereby the shafts begin life avoiding machining from solid which as high grade steel is both wasteful and expensive.
alloy forgings the parts undergo automatic shaft straightening to correct any distortion caused by high processing temperatures shafts requiring an ebw operation after heat treatment are first selectively chemically the shafts require coated to prevent carbon carburising to increase their penetration: this will ensure wear resistance and impart a clean electron beam weld high hardness properties.
at a later stage they are then quenched and tempered to remove internal stresses the shafts need assembly with their gear or drum using ebw.
the parts are ultrasonically cleaned and measured to ensure no contamination of the parts during the ebw vacuum process which fuses the parent metal of the parts together the shafts are machined again to achieve final engineering dimensions BoDyCote Component Journeys this is just one example of how bodycote brings together the huge wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the Group to provide the vital engineering services our customers need...
