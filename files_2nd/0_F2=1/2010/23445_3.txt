Together with the ZDP liability of 50 million as at 30 September 2010, this resulted in net long term gearing of 2 million.
The investment portfolio consists primarily of direct investments in unlisted and listed companies together with investments in funds where investments are held in limited partnerships managed by other private equity managers.

Listed investments may also be held where they arise from previously unlisted investments and continue to generate the returns required under Electras investment objectives.
Investments in funds are made principally to gain exposure to geographic areas outside the UK and which, because of the relationship with the fund manager, are likely to generate co-investment opportunities for Electra.
