Governance Remuneration Report Remuneration Policy The principal objectives of the Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by Mr E van Amerongen and comprises the Non-executive Directors, are to attract, retain and motivate high quality senior management with a competitive package of incentives and awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders.
The Committee seeks to ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded taking into account all elements of their remuneration package in the light of the Groups performance.
The Committee has appointed Deloitte LLP to provide independent market information and advice relating to executive remuneration and benefits.
Deloitte LLP are considered to be independent as they provide only very limited other services to the Group.
As described below, a significant proportion of potential total remuneration is performance related and is built around annual and longer term incentives.
For Directors achieving median performance, performance related pay would represent approximately 40% of total remuneration.
if performance were such that the maximum award available under each incentive scheme was paid, performance related pay would represent approximately 70% of total remuneration.
Basic Salary The basic salary element is determined primarily by reference to external data which takes into account the Executive Directors duties and responsibilities.
Basic salary is generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
in recognition of their performance, the importance of retention and market comparison of Executive Director remuneration, the Committee awarded pay increases with effect from 1 April 2010.
Mr T Drurys basic salary was increased from 390,000 to 420,000 per annum and that of Mr C. Surch from 250,000 to 275,000 per annum.
Annual Cash Bonuses Annual cash bonuses for Executive Directors are paid at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee as a percentage of base salary dependent upon corporate financial performance compared to target and achievement of personal objectives.
For the year to 31 March 2010 having considered previously the advice of remuneration consultants and consulted with shareholders, a minimum 10% of salary was payable for threshold corporate financial performance, representing 90% of budget.
A total of 25% and 20% of salary was payable to the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director respectively for achievement of 2009 10 budget whilst a maximum 75% and 50% respectively would be payable for outperformance of budget.
Together with the retained 25% component for achievement of personal objectives, which included a cash target element based on underlying free cash flow as a percentage of trading profit, the maximum aggregate bonus potential for the positions of Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director were 100% and 75% respectively, having been reduced from 125% and 100% in the previous year.
Minimum threshold performance of the corporate financial component was exceeded for 2009 10 equating to a pro-rated entitlement of 19.4% and 16.3% of base salary for Mr T Drury and Mr C Surch respectively.
Together with achievement of personal objectives relating to 18.8% of base salary for both Directors, the Remuneration Committee determined that total bonuses of 38.2% and 35.1% be awarded to Mr T Drury and Mr C Surch respectively.
A proportion of these payments equivalent to 35.2% and 30.3% of salary based on forecast financial performance and an assessment of personal objectives was paid to Mr T Drury and Mr C Surch respectively at the end of March 2010, subject to a strict clawback mechanism in the event of potential overpayment.
The outstanding proportion of bonus now due will be paid in June 2010.
Given the ongoing difficulty in predicting financial performance and forecasting earnings in the current economic climate the Remuneration Committee have determined to operate a similar but more stretching bonus plan for 2010 11 based on the achievement of Full Potential Plan targets.
The Full Potential Plan represents a stretch of approximately 13% on profit before tax.
For the corporate financial performance element 25% of base salary will be paid as a bonus for achievement of budget, with up to 75% payable for achievement of the Full Potential Plan.
Together with a 25% component for achievement of personal objectives, including an underlying free cash flow target element, the maximum aggregate bonus potential for both Executive Directors is 100%.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review these arrangements for future years.
Long Term Incentive Plan Under the Long Term incentive Plan LTiP Executive Directors and senior employees may be granted an award annually, the vesting of which is subject to the attainment of performance conditions measured over a three year period.
Awards are in the form of Shanks Group plc shares.
The maximum value in any financial year is limited to 100% of basic salary as at the date of grant and is calculated on the Companys share price at that time.
