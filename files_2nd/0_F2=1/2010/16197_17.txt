The Groups Rest of the World assets form an important part of Tullows business.
Gas production in the UK and South Asia contribute important revenues while low-risk exploration prospects and development opportunities in Europe combine with high-impact potential in South America and South Asia to provide an exciting exploration portfolio.
Europe Tullows well established producing assets lie in the Southern Gas Basin offshore UK and are centred around two gas producing hubs, associated fields and infrastructure.
Tullow also has a portfolio of mostly operated exploration blocks offshore the Netherlands where it is looking to capitalise on the exploration success it has experienced in adjacent UK blocks in recent years.
UK 1 Production in 2010 from the UK assets exceeded expectations averaging 13,300 boepd 2009: 14,450 boepd.
In the Thames Area, production was in line with expectations supported by a full year of combined flow from the Tullow-operated Horne, Wren and Wissey fields.
In the CMS Area, higher rates were achieved as a result of the successful implementation of a detailed well performance improvement programme on the Ketch field, the earlier than forecast tie-in of the Ketch-8z well, the successful in-fill drilling on the Boulton field and various well interventions across the portfolio.
2010 marked a busy year of operational activity in the CMS Area.
The Boulton B5 infill well was drilled and brought on stream: successful well interventions took place on the Kelvin field: and a development concept and export route was agreed for the Harrison development in block 44 19b with gas production anticipated to commence in the second half of 2012.
In addition, the Ketch-8z well was brought on production ahead of schedule in August 2010 and the Ketch-10 well is now planned for 2 2011.

These blocks are considered to have material gas prospectivity.
Tullow intends to drill a well in the first half of 2011 and in the event of a success, the well will be tied back to Thames, deferring field abandonment and generating additional revenues.
Netherlands Building on the successful exploitation of the Carboniferous play in the UK CMS Area, Tullow has been building an extensive operated position in the adjacent underexplored Carboniferous province of the Dutch offshore sector and now has interests in10 blocks.
In early 2010, Tullow and its partners participated in two major 3D seismic reprocessing programmes and the results led to the acquisition of a significant 1,600 sq km high specification 3D seismic survey during the summer.
The data will be used in 2011 to mature the prospect inventory for apotential drilling campaign in 2012 and 2013.
Tullow participated with a 4.3% working interest in the drilling of the non-operated Muscovite prospect, 1 which extends into Block E13b and sits immediately south of the Tullow operated acreage in the E blocks.
The purpose of participating was to calibrate geological risk factors in the area at a low cost to Tullow.
The well found only residual gas and was plugged and abandoned.
Valuable insights from this well will now be applied to Tullows Carboniferous exploration acreage in the Netherlands.
Portugal Following the completion of work programme commitments in the frontier, deep-water Alentejo Basin and a detailed evaluation of the full subsurface dataset, Tullow took the decision not to pursue this opportunity any further and its operated interest in the acreage was transferred to other parties within the Joint Venture.
South Asia The demand for energy in Asian economies remainsstrong.
This region offers Tullow excellent growth potential through exploration, particularly inPakistan, where the Group has a significant non-operated position.

I transferred to the London office in 2009 and there are numerous opportunities for Tullow employees to travel and grow professionally.
There is a wide range of career development options for both experienced and new employees.
Tullow also really values its people in terms of benefits and compensation and I am delighted to be here and look forward to many more years with the Company.
