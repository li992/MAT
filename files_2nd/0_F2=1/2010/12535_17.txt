Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 13 Since 2009, reserves and resources amounting to 56 mmboe have been added towards the 200 mmboe target.
With further evaluation and appraisal, we estimate that this could rise to over 100 mmboe of additions.
Asia Indonesia On the Premier-operated Tuna Block, final plans were completed for the drilling of two exploration wells, Gajah Laut Utara and Belut Laut, in the first half of 2011.
- ` follow on from the nearby C Ro ng Do CRD appraisal well in the neighbouring Vietnamese block as part of a three well programme using the same drilling rig.
On Natuna Sea Block A, plans were completed for the drilling of two near-field exploration wells, Anoa Deep and Biawak Besar, scheduled for drilling in the third and fourth quarters of 2011.
A review is in progress to refine the remaining prospective resource potential of the entire block.
This study is set for completion in the first half of 2011, for incorporation into a five-year exploration plan on the block.
On Block A Aceh, plans were completed for the drilling of one exploration well, Matang, scheduled for drilling in the third quarter of 2011.
Elsewhere, on the Buton Block in Sulawesi, plans were finalised for an exploration well, Benteng, now expected to be drilled in the second half of 2011.
Vietnam Following the 2009 exploration success at CRD in Block 07 03, Premier integrated the well results into the new 3D seismic data and then sought and obtained Government of Vietnam approval for an appraisal plan for CRD.
The first appraisal well on CRD was spudded in February 2011.
Continued activity elsewhere on Block 07 03 included the acquisition of 2 900km of new 3D seismic data over the southern part of the block.
Interpretation of these data and of the previously acquired data in the east of the block will allow selection of prospects for exploration drilling in 2012.
2 In Block 104-109 05, offshore northern Vietnam, 445km of new 3D seismic data and reconnaissance 2D lines were acquired and interpreted to aid the final selection of the location for an exploration well, planned for the third quarter of 2011.
North Sea and West Africa UK In April, the Bugle North well was drilled as a joint appraisal well on the boundary of Blocks 15 23c and 15 23d.
Premier effectively paid 37 per cent of the joint well cost to earn a 50 per cent equity in 15 23d.
The well was targeting the northern extension of the Bugle oil discovery and encountered minor quantities of hydrocarbon, but these are considered insufficient to support a Bugle development at this time.
In May, the Catcher exploration discovery well 28 9-1 Premier 35 per cent encountered 80 feet of high-quality oil in the Cromarty reservoir.
Catcher East was drilled as a side-track to the main well, approximately 0.5km to the east.
This well found hydrocarbons in younger Tay sands which are in communication with the initial discovery in the Cromarty sand.
A core recovered 44 feet of net oil-bearing Tay sand with an average porosity of 34 per cent.
A second side-track, Catcher South West, encountered 68 feet of net hydrocarbon pay and a common oil water contact with the Catcher main well.
