In contrast year of approximately 1:1.12 and 1:US$1.50.
Actual exchange rates were 1:1.13 and revenue growth in emerging economies, in particular India and Africa, is expected to 1:US$1.60.
2 The Groups guidance did not include the impact of reorganisation costs arising from the Alltel continue as the Group drives penetration and data in these markets.
EBITDA margins are expected to decline but at a significantly lower rate than that experienced in the previous year.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of 11.2 billion to 12.0 billion.
Total depreciation and amortisation charges are expected to be slightly higher than the prior year, before the impact of licence and spectrum purchases, if any, during the 2011 financial year.
Free cash flow is expected to be in excess of 6.5 billion reflecting a continued but lower level of benefit from the working capital improvement programme launched in the 2010 financial year.
We intend to maintain capital expenditure at a similar level to last year, adjusted for foreign exchange, ensuring that we continue to invest in high speed data networks, enhancing our customer experience and increasing the attractiveness of the Groups data services.
The adjusted tax rate percentage is expected to be in the mid 20s for the 2011 financial year with the Group targeting a similar level in the medium-term.
The Group continues to seek resolution of the UK Controlled Foreign Company and India tax cases.
Three year free cash flow and dividend per share growth target We expect that annual free cash flow will be between 6.0 billion and 7.0 billion, in each of the financial years in the period ending 31 March 2013, underpinning a dividend per share growth target of at least 7% per annum for each of these financial years.
We therefore expect that total dividends per share will be no less than 10.18p for the 2013 financial year.
Assumptions Guidance is based on our current assessment of the global economic outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates of 1:1.15 and 1:US$1.50 throughout this three year period.
It excludes the impact of licence and spectrum purchases, if any, material one-off tax settlements and restructuring costs and assumes no material change to the current structure of the Group.
With respect to the dividend growth target, as the Groups free cash flow is predominantly generated by companies operating within the euro currency zone, we have assumed that the euro to sterling rate remains within 10% of the above guidance exchange rate.
A 1% change in the euro to sterling exchange rate would impact adjusted operating profit by approximately 70 million and free cash flow by approximately 60 million.
