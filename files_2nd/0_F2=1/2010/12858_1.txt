Our markets are likely to remain uncertain for some time, but we now have a decisive programme of self-help to restore value.
We are acting to make our costs more competitive, our productivity better and our debt lower.
We are changing our structure to benefit from QinetiQs overall strengths.
Most of all, we are working to transform our culture into one based on leadership, accountability and empowerment of what is an outstanding group of people.
