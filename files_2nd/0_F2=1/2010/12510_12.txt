Despite this severe downturn in profitability, we believe the Brookes Avana business continues to produce excellent quality products and that it has innovation credentials.
We are in constructive dialogue with the main customer, Marks and Spencer, with regard to revised product ranges, pricing and supply arrangements which we believe will return the business to profitability in 2011.
Tim Kelly Chief Operating Officer Since the acquisition of RHM the business has operated through a divisional structure.
We are now returning to a more centralised structure with clear brand focus and functional alignment.
The first step in the process was the appointment of Tim Kelly as Chief Operating Officer, in January 2011, with responsibility for managing all brands across Premier.
To ensure greater functional alignment we have created two new roles: Group Marketing Director and Group Technical Director, both of whom now sit on the Group Executive.
This in turn will lead to greater focus on brand growth within our Drive and Core brands.
