3 GEMCO Tonnes are stated as in situ, manganese grades are given as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective tonnage yields.
4 Wessels and Mamatwan Hotazel As stated in the 2009 Annual Report, our interest has been reduced as a result of a sequence of Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment agreements with Ntsimbintle Mining Pty Ltd, Iziko, NCAB and the HMM Educational Trust, BHP Billitons share in Hotazel Manganese Mines Pty Ltd is now 44.4%.
A Section 102 application has been lodged with the Dept of Mineral Resources to amend the Wessels Mining Rights area to include the Ntsimbintle Prospecting Right.
The Section 102 Application for Mamatwan is pending.
The Wessels and Ntsimbintle as well as the Mamatwan and Ntsimbintle Mineral Resources, which are at present declared separately, will be declared as one upon finalisation of the applications.
5 Mamatwan Mamatwan is now reported on a dry tonnes basis.
6 Beniomi and Bordeaux These resources are reported here for the first time.
These resources have been previously drilled and pitted.
More recently, a program of resource evaluation large diameter bucket auger and mini sonic drilling commenced on the Beniomi and later the Bordeaux Plateaux.
This was focused upon providing feed for a pilot plant that has informed the decisions as to eventual economic viability of the Mineral Resource reported.
Tonnes stated are for in situ resource, Mn grades are for 0.15mm screen size fraction and should be read together with their respective tonnage yields.
