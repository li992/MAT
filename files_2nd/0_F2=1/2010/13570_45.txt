72 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2010 Financial statements governance Business review governance Andrew Shilston is a member of the Groups UK pension scheme.
He is also a member of the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme Scheme.
The purpose of the Scheme is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension schemes by the 1989 Finance Act.
Membership of the Scheme is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.
Employer contributions to the Scheme during 2010 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2010 for the registered defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the final two columns of the first table below.
Sir John Rose opted out of future pension accrual with effect from February 1, 2008 and started to receive his pension immediately.
Mike Terrett opted out of future pension accrual with effect from April 1, 2006 and started to receive his pension from November 1, 2009.
The transfer value for Mike Terrett as at December 31, 2009 was calculated using market gilt yields on that date and included cash taken on retirement whereas the transfer value as at December 31, 2010 is the value of benefits in payment calculated using gilt yields applicable on that date.
Since starting to receive their pensions, neither Sir John Rose nor Mike Terrett accrue any further pension benefit or allowance in lieu of pension benefit from their ongoing employment with the Group.
Colin Smith opted out of future pension accrual with effect from April 1, 2006.
He receives a cash allowance in lieu of future pension accrual.
Had he elected to continue to accrue pension the estimated cost of that accrual would be higher than the cash allowance to be paid in lieu.
