Mans eld Site Tredegar Site An energy monitoring system was installed at our Cumbernauld Cumbernauld Site Forfar Site Logistics site, which has our largest electricity consumption.
This has enabled investigation of energy usage in far greater detail and contributed to a 3% reduction in energy usage per litre of product produced.

to reduce the quantity of waste we send to land ll through the introduction of waste recycling programmes.
The use of recycled materials within our packaging materials has made progress in two key areas across 2009 as described below.
Mans eld became the first site within the business to send zero waste to land ll: this was achieved in November 2009.
Trials have been successfully completed using 25% recycled The Mans eld site had regularly been achieving recycling rates PET rPET in our Strathmore PET range, our Tizer and Rubicon of between 85% and 95% but continued to push on to the zero 500ml bottles and 2010 will see the continued use of rPET in these waste target.
To achieve this they send the remaining waste bottles whilst exploring the opportunities of further extending the to a local Material Recycling Facility MRF who sort the waste use of rPET across our other bottles.

Switching to the use of recycled layer pads across all our Sustainable Packaging sites has saved 235 tonnes annum of virgin corrugate board.
Our strategy to improve sustainable packaging is two fold, i packaging material reduction and ii increased use of To support us in improving the sustainability of our packaging recycled materials.

The aim is to reduce the carbon impact of grocery packaging by 10% by the end of 2012, against a 2009 baseline: Extensive internal and consumer trials have been completed with reducing U. K. household food and drink wastes by 4% by the end our 2 litre PET and 330ml bottles and a roll-out plan to lightweight of 2012, based on a 2009 baseline: these bottles was implemented in December.

This includes both solid and liquid wastes.
The investment plans in place at Cumbernauld for 2010 allow us to continue our PET lightweighting programme.
Our 2 litre, 500ml and 250ml PET bottles produced from the site will all see design changes during 2010, which will deliver a further 8% reduction in PET usage across these speci c bottles.
