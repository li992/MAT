Until recently though, television has lagged behind other media as a means for reaching only the most appropriate consumers.
Experian has been involved in a ground-breaking trial with US cable company, Comcast, to make television advertising more relevant for viewers and more accountable for advertisers.
Working with Comcast and major marketers, such as General Motors and Procter & Gamble, Experian segmented viewers into anonymous groups of households, matching relevant advertising messages to each group.
Comcast was then able to deliver a range of advertisements within the same commercial break, targeted according to the characteristics of particular households.
The latest trial results have shown that television advertising targeted at defined groups is up to 65% more cost effective, with viewers 32% less likely to switch channels during the commercial break.
Andrew Ward, Vice-President of Strategic Initiatives for Comcast Spotlight, commented: Our trials have delivered terrific results, and represent an important part of the shift in television advertising from one-tomany marketing towards a one-to-few model.
