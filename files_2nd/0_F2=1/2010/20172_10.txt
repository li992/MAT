3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2010 15 Underlying asset performance The fully operational assets in which the Company holds an equity stake continued to perform strongly, despite the difficult macroeconomic conditions experienced for most of the year.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA for these assets increased by 11.2% on a like-for-like basis compared to last year, underpinning continued robust income generation from the portfolio.
This increase is evidence of the continued improvements in the operational performance of 3i Infrastructures portfolio companies, as well as of the robustness of the infrastructure asset class as a whole.
An improving global macroeconomic environment should support continued stability in the underlying performance of the Companys assets.
Assets excluded from this analysis are those substantially still in construction, such as T2C, those within the 3i India Infrastructure Fund, as well as Elgin, which was purchased only at the end of the financial year.
