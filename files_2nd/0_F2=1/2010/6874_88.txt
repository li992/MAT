AnnualBonus The Committee seeks to structure annual bonus arrangements so as to encourage sustainable growth in the Companys profits: and is satisfied that the structure will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently encouraging irresponsible behaviour.
Each executive director has a personal objective to ensure they monitor and take appropriate action to minimise key business risks.
The Committees policy is that all bonus payments to executive directors should be non-pensionable.
