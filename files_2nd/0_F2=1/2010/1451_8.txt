Approximately 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma.
It is one of the most common chronic diseases and its prevalence is increasing every year, especially among children.
It is estimated that by 2025 there will be an additional 100 million sufferers.
Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be treated effectively.
Research shows that with the right treatment nearly all asthma patients can achieve and maintain good asthma control, enabling them to live full and active lives.
Our Symbicort medicine provides important improvement in the health of many patients with asthma.
Symbicort pMDI pressurised metered-dose inhaler is approved in the US for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.
Outside the US, our Symbicort Turbuhaler maintenance and reliever therapy SMART combines both regular maintenance and as-needed reliever therapies.
It is the only asthma treatment regime to do so and allows patients to control daily symptoms and reduce the severity and number of asthma attacks using a single inhaler.
It gives asthma patients what they want in daily symptom control and also gives them what they need in the longer term improved asthma management.
Because health connects us all For more information go to the Therapy Area Review from page 50.
