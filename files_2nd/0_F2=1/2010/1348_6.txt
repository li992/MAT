For example, we are currently experiencing greatest demand from government and infrastructure projects where stimulus spending is sustaining activity levels.
Traditionally, our strength is in smaller local commercial and residential projects and we are focused on retaining this exposure as we believe this segment of the market will recover first.
Despite the recession, we have deliberately maintained the overall quality of our fleet and have not aged it as much as in previous downward cycles.
The fleet is therefore still in good shape and we expect to be able quickly to reduce fleet age and expand it as economies recover.
This recession, we have also been able to take advantage of the opportunity created by distressed asset sales to acquire a small amount of nearly new equipment at advantageous prices.
our fleet 11 our 4 balance sheet strength We maintain a conservative balance sheet structure throughout the economic cycle, pacing our investment in the good years to ensure we hold leverage within our two to three times net debt to EBITDA target leverage range.
During the most recent cycle, our balance sheet has been reinforced by the manner in which we lowered investment levels rapidly from 2008 to ensure we generated significant free cash flow and lowered net debt throughout the recession.
In November 2009 we took advantage of our strong operational performance and relatively low leverage to extend the maturity of $1.3bn of our senior debt until November 2013.
We decided last summer to undertake this refinancing nearly a year before it was required in order to gain certainty over the committed term, size and cost of our senior debt facility both so that we were well positioned to invest and take advantage when markets recovered and also to provide protection in the event that recovery was delayed.
Our capital structure therefore has, by design, the flexibility and strength required to enable our businesses to succeed and prosper in the years ahead.
