14 Premier Farnell Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Strategic Overview: Key Performance Indicators Key Performance Indicators In the three years since we began to transform our business we have made strong progress in many areas.
2010 saw us accelerate our business transformation and our operations have continued to recognise the significant benefits that the execution of our strategy brings.
However, like many companies this year, we have not been immune to the impact of the economic downturn, making the progress we have delivered in this last year even more of an achievement.
As we look forward to 2011, we will continue on our transformational journey, working towards targets that are aligned to the business future.
These targets are shared in full on pages 37 and 38 of this report.
