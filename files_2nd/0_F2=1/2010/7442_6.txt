main operations and on expanding its project pipeline which now includes three advanced projects and eight Company Makers projects with the potential to achieve 2030 million silver equivalent ounces per year.
The significant investment in 2011 will support the delivery of an extensive and targeted drill programme covering 335,000 metres across the four target countries mentioned above.
The budget will be split between exploration work at the Companys existing operations and on identifying and developing high-quality, early stage projects which have the potential to move through the pipeline to production.

Questions to the CEO: You refer to Company Makers, whatarethese?
Company Makers are projects which have the potential to achieve production of 2030 million silver equivalent ounces per year.
These projects are likely to be high sulphidation disseminated type deposits, typically mined as open pit.
To increase the potential for growth, we are increasing the number of projects inthis category and now have eight Company Makers inthe pipeline.
