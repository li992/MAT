20 21 Overview Performance Exploration Technological Project Development, Mining Support Engineering & Processing & Construction Focus on Exploration The work of our geological team plays a very important role in developing the Groups business.
We have explored dozens of deposits and discovered new areas of mineralisation, which ensure that the Group will have a supply of mineral resources for many years to come.
The main asset of the Amur region is its mineral resources.
You can find any metal imaginable here gold, iron, nickel, copper, tin, tungsten, molybdenum.
If you cannot find some metals I guess no one has started looking for them yet!
