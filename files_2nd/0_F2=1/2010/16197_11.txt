With its partners, Tullow achieved this milestone only 40 months after the first discovery in 2007, a new benchmark for the industry.

The field itself, in Tullows view, has a P50 resource base of 700 million barrels which will be targeted through subsequent phases of development in the coming years.
The Jubilee discovery identified a new geological 86% play in Ghana, and utilising this data and expertise, Tullow identified further prospectivity.
Since 2008 Tullow has discovered the Odum, Enyenra, Ghanaian workforce Tweneboa and Teak fields containing a combination of oil, gas and condensate.
While more complex than Jubilee, these fields represent significant resource potential for future development.

We are continuing to capitalise on our success in exploiting the Jubileeplay with a high-impact but high risk drilling campaign in West Africa and South America planned for 2011.
Robin Sutherland, Exploration Manager, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cte dIvoire Beyond Jubilee Global and industry best practice Carrying out well operations in a safe and efficient manner is of paramount importance to Tullow.
On page 26, Paul McDade, our COO, outlines our commitment to making safety a top priority and how we support this by adopting the best global and industry standards wherever we work.
In 2010, we reviewed all of our well engineering practices and procedures and these reviews have indicated that we are following best practice.
For example, in Ghana, we have a safety case regime for the Jubilee FPSO based on the North Sea standard and analysis post-Macondo in the Gulf of Mexico has shown this regime is one of the most robust processes for managing risk on such large projects.
