Corporate Governance continued Directors Indemnities and conflicts As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force under which the Company has agreed to indemnify the directors, to the extent permitted by law, in respect of losses arising out of or in connection with the execution of their duties, powers or responsibilities as directors of the Company.
The indemnities do not apply in situations where the relevant director has been guilty of fraud or wilful misconduct.
Under the authority granted to them in the Companys Articles of Association, the Board has considered carefully any situation declared by any director pursuant to which he she has or might have a conflict of interest and, where it considers it appropriate to do so, has authorised the continuation of that situation.
In exercising its authority, the directors have had regard to their statutory and other duties to the Company.
