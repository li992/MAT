down to eartH - a CoMponent journey muD rotors Corrosion and wear can lead to expensive downtime in oil & gas exploration, where equipment is in continual use.
Mud rotors operate at the bottom of drilling wells, and as a result, the removal and replacement of worn rotors is particularly time consuming and costly.
Following processing by bodycote, the life of mud rotors is improved significantly.
the rotors begin life as pieces of steel bar a thermochemically formed ceramic surface treatment is applied resulting in a super-hard, corrosion resistant layer which protects the steel and gives superior wear resistance the steel is then machined into the rotor shape required for down-hole drilling photo courtesy of weingartner www.
