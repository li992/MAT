Intensive research into the retail market has given us new acquisitions and development insights into the way consumer needs, habits and aspirations are changing, and the effect of online shopping and other technologies on physical retailing.
The insights gained are now guiding our strategy.

expenditure and irrecoverable costs associated Over time, the potential casualties of the structural changes are likely to be with shopping centres shops in medium size towns where there is a low quality offer and poor facilities, especially those located near bigger centres.
Rental recovery is likely to reflect this, becoming polarised across UK towns and cities according to the level of vacancies and the attraction of individual assets.
We saw signs of this polarisation in the second half of the year and expect the trend to continue into 2011 and beyond.
Shoppers continue to value convenience, hence the continued rise of supermarkets, which has taken place in tandem with the growth of online retailing.
This is one reason why we are working closely with supermarkets such as J Sainsbury, in our Harvest partnership, and other major retailers, such as John Lewis, on continuing to grow and develop our out-of-town offer.
The consumer preference for the choice provided by big centres means we expect the long-term trend of retail sales moving to the biggest locations to continue.
This is evidenced by the level of retailer interest in our proposed Leeds Trinity scheme in Leeds and reflects our increased focus on long-term dominant assets.
