Overall we believe the improvements we are making and health plans dominate the private market.
Physicians are to our cost structure and how we operate are enabling us to consolidating their practices into medical centers, group practices compete more effectively in the evolving marketplace.

increasingly linking reimbursement with improved health outcomes.
Implementation of landmark healthcare reform legislation in the USA also began during the year.
As a result, in January 2010, Medicaid drug rebates increased from 15% to 23% and were extended to include Medicaid managed care plans and new formulations of existing products.
Also in January, eligibility for certain government drug pricing programs was expanded to include additional hospitals and health centers.
In response to these evolving market conditions, we are making fundamental changes to our US operations to ensure that we deliver the value our customers patients, healthcare providers and payers demand.
These changes are enabling us to more effectively meet customer needs and expectations, better deploy our resources and support an evolving, more specialised product portfolio.
For example, the majority of our US pharmaceuticals sales representatives now have either customer-centred or portfoliofocused responsibilities, rather than product specic responsibilities.
These changes have enabled us to increase the productivity of our sales force while reducing its size by approximately 25% since 2008.
Most importantly, our new customer-centric model aligns with our customers desire to work with us as a business-tobusiness partner.

Much of our work is targeted on building evidence on the cost effectiveness of our Although reported sales were down 6% to 6.5 billion, underlying medicines when compared to current treatments.
For example, performance excluding pandemic related products, Avandia and in the UK we have agreed an innovative pricing agreement with Valtrex was at.
This was a creditable performance as it includes the National Institute for Clinical Excellence NICE for our approximately 150 million sales impact from government price advanced kidney cancer medicine, Votrient.
It was driven by the introduction of new products and growth from other products in our portfolio.
Despite likely continued as effective as sunitinib, the current standard of care, in the government pricing pressure in 2011, this strong product portfolio comparative trials which are currently underway, we have gives us confidence in future performance of this business.
We introduced five new products in 2010.
A particular highlight was Duodart, our treatment combination of Avodart and tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Other recently introduced brands such as Avamys, Requip Modutab, Tyverb, Volibris and Wellbutrin all achieved double digit growth.
Our major product, Seretide for asthma and COPD, while impacted by the price cuts, achieved sales of 1.6 billion, up 2% whilst maintaining its leadership position in the respiratory market.
We continue to bring the benets of this product to more patients across Europe.
Our portfolio of vaccines also contributed to growth with Synorix, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, winning several national tenders and increasing sales by 38% to 43 million.
To manage our operating costs, the business has also delivered improvements in efficiency.
Close control of our operating expenses delivered savings in excess of 10% and our programme to reduce the diversity of cartons, labels and leaets used across our range of medicines delivered further savings.
As part of this initiative we will reduce 35 different formats of tablet blister packs to just 3 by 2013.
An 11% reduction in SG&A costs, reecting savings from the restructuring programme, helped to limit the decline in operating profit to 4%.
Our commitment to work with communities across Europe to support greater access and to build trust with stakeholders continues.
An example is a project in Bulgaria to promote awareness for vaccines among vulnerable ethnic minority groups through collaboration between the health mediators, general practitioners and the representatives of the regional health inspectorates.
The initiative facilitates the access of these groups to the national healthcare system, focusing on prevention and health awareness.
A particular benefit from this work in 2010 was an improved rate of immunisation in this group which in turn reduced the impact from an outbreak of measles.

A number of vaccine production alliances were also concluded during the year including an alliance with JSC Binnopharm, a Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer, to enable the local secondary manufacture of a number of key GSK vaccines in Russia.

The companys unique structure and wide portfolio of 10 available medicines, provides financial stability and the investment capital required to take a sustainable, long-term view of the HIV market.
Overall, sales of HIV products by ViiV Healthcare were down 3% to 1.6 billion in 2010.
Sales of former Pzer products Celsentri Selzentry and Viracept combined sales of 118 million and growth from Epzicom Kivexa up 1% to 555 million partially offset reductions in the sales from other established HIV products including Trizivir down 28% to 144 million, Combivir down 16% to 363 million, Lexiva Telzir down 12% to 155 million and Epivir down 12% to 115 million which continue to be impacted by uptake of newer alternative products.
Strong growth for Celsentri Selzentry compared with 2009 was supported by the wide acceptance of genotypic testing across Europe, increasing first-line use in the USA and country launches In 2010, as part of its commitment to address major unmet needs in Poland, Romania, Australia, Japan and Mexico.

As a result, revenue in the International the end of the year expanded the Funds reach and scope.
ViiV Healthcare operating profits decreased 21% primarily as a result of US healthcare reform and higher SG&A and R&D costs partially offset by a one-time royalty settlement.
The higher SG&A costs were primarily due to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
2010 also saw great progress in building a late-stage pipeline.
In October, Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare announced the start of their Phase III development programme for the novel integrase inhibitor S GSK1349572 572, with a further Phase III trial for xed dose combination 572-Tri 572 Epzicom Kivexa initiated in February 2011.
ViiV Healthcare is committed to supporting the communities most affected by the HIV epidemic.
One way the company does this is by developing innovative approaches to improve access to medicines.
For example, in July 2010, ViiV Healthcare was the first company to make its entire current and future anti-retroviral portfolio available to generic manufacturers through royalty-free voluntary licences.
These cover all of the least developed, low income countries and sub-Saharan Africa, the 69 countries where 80% of people with HIV live.
Similarly, the not-for-profit pricing policy has been expanded to these 69 countries.
During the year, ViiV Healthcare also launched the Positive Action Southern Initiative in the USA to reduce healthcare disparities among communities with the greatest needs.
