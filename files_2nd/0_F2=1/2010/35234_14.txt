However, the property is located on-site or starting in 2011 adjacent to Euston station, which may be extended to form the London terminus of the proposed high speed rail link, HS2.
The exact location, timing and funding of this major project is subject to public consultation which is currently underway.
If HS2 progresses as currently proposed, our Hampstead Road property could be impacted and, consequently, we are seeking clarification before finalising the extent and scale of our redevelopment plans.
The existing leases expire by September 2011 and we are looking to firm up our plans towards the end of the year.
Further office projects at 40 Chancery Lane WC2 and Turnmill EC1 are earmarked to start in 2012 and total 170,000 sq ft 15,800m.
These are in various stages of evaluation and planning.
A considerable amount of the planning work undertaken in 2010 involved a number of major projects for 2013 and beyond.
These are well advanced and 2011 will be an important year with planning decisions anticipated at City Road Estate EC1, 80 Charlotte Street W1 and 1 Oxford Street W1.
Elsewhere, we continue to progress appraisal studies at 1-5 Grosvenor Place SW1 and 55-65 North Wharf Road W2.
Finally, although our projects are generally office-led, we look at alternative uses if greater value can be gained.
We are investigating two such opportunities at 60 Commercial Road E1 and Riverwalk House, 157-166 Millbank SW1.
