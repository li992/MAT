The nature of our involvement in property partnerships is set out in the second and Investment strategy third paragraphs of the Investment vehicles section of Financial Our investment portfolio supports a range of businesses operating Statements IFRS Accounting policies C Consolidation in a number of geographical locations.
Our aim is to match the principles.
Property partnerships are accounted for as subsidiaries, investments held to support a line of business to the nature of joint ventures or financial investments depending on our the underlying liabilities, while at the same time considering participation and the terms of each partnership agreement.
For local regulatory requirements, the level of risk inherent within each property partnership accounted for as a subsidiary, joint different investments, and the desire to generate superior venture or financial investment, we are exposed to falls in the investment returns, where compatible with this stated value of the underlying properties which are reflected as strategy and risk appetite.

business vary in their cash flows and in the expectations placed upon them by policyholders, we need to hold different types of investment to meet these different cash flows and expectations.
The UK with-profits business is comprised largely of long-term contracts with some guaranteed payments.
We are therefore able to invest a significant proportion of the funds supporting this business in equities and real estate.
This is because the long-term nature of these contracts allows us to take advantage of the longterm growth potential within these classes of assets, while the level of guaranteed payments is managed to mitigate the level of risk that we bear in relation to the volatility of these classes of assets.
Annuities and non-participating contracts, on the other hand, have a high level of guaranteed future payments.
We endeavour to match the investments held against these types of business to future cash flows.
We therefore have a policy of generally holding fixed income securities and mortgage loans with appropriate maturity dates.
With unit-linked business, the primary objective is to maximise investment returns, subject to following an investment policy consistent with the representations that we have made to our unit-linked product policyholders.
58 Aviva plc Analysis of investments continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Analysis of investments We distinguish between policyholder, participating fund and shareholder investments, which are terms used to reflect the differing exposure to investment gains and losses.
Policyholder assets are connected to our unit-linked business, where the policyholder bears the investment risk on the assets in the unit-linked funds.
Our exposure to loss on policyholder assets is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the funds.
Participating fund assets related to some of our insurance and investment contracts which contain a discretionary participating feature, which is a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
Our exposure to investment losses on participating funds is generally limited to our participation in the fund.
Shareholder assets are other assets held within our long-term businesses that are not backing unit-linked liabilities or participating funds.
The apportionment of our shareholder assets is predominantly weighted towards debt securities and loans.
In comparison, policyholder and participating funds contain a greater proportion of equities and other investments e. g. unit trusts, reflecting the underlying investment mandates.
Financial investment balances included in the remainder of this disclosure include financial investments of operations classified as held for sale.
During 2010, the Group undertook a review of investment classifications, the allocation of assets between shareholder, participating and policyholder funds, and credit rating classifications, with the following effect on 2009 previously reported amounts: In our Spanish business debt securities of 2,362 million and equity securities of 10 million previously recognised as participating fund assets have been reclassified as shareholder assets.
In our UK Life business investments and other assets backing indexed linked policies previously recognised as policyholder assets have been reclassified as shareholder assets.
Reclassified assets total 1,890 million, split 1,214 million debt securities, 551 million loans, 97 million other investments and 28 million reinsurance assets.
In our business in France, equity and debt securities held indirectly through majority owned consolidated mutual funds previously presented as unit trusts and other investment vehicles within other investments, are now presented as equity and debt securities.
The effect is to increase equity and debt securities by 2,085 million and 1,247 million and decrease unit trusts and other investment vehicles within other investments by 3,332 million.
In our businesses in the UK the credit ratings of certain non-rated private placements and other bonds totalling 1,917 million have previously been classified according to their internal credit ratings.
These are now classified as non-rated.
The net effect of the adjustments above is to increase shareholder investment at 31 December 2009 by 4,262 million and decrease policyholder and participating fund investments by 1,890 million and 2,372 million respectively.
Where relevant, 2009 comparative amounts in the table above and those that follow in this section have been adjusted accordingly.
None of the adjustments above affects balances reported in the IFRS primary statements.

Debt securities We grade debt securities according to current external credit ratings issued at the balance sheet date.
The credit rating used for each individual security is the second highest of the available ratings from Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
If a credit rating is available from only one of these three rating agencies then this rating is used.
If an individual security has not been given a credit rating by any of these three rating agencies, the security is classified as non-rated.
For the tables below we have used the standard Standard & Poors rating classifications.
Investment grade debt securities are classified within the range of AAA extremely strong to BBB good ratings, with AAA being the highest possible rating.
Debt securities which fall outside this range are classified as speculative grade.
Where we use a rating provided by Moodys or Fitch, we have expressed it as the Standard & Poors equivalent rating.
For example, we consider Standard & Poors rating of AA very strong to be equivalent to Moodys rating of AA excellent and Fitchs rating of AA very strong.
Despite the market downgrade activity during 2009 and 2010, debt securities with a credit rating of A or above at 31 December 2010 still represented 77% of total holdings 2009: 80%.
Approximately 41% of total debt security holdings are in government bonds and 33% of total debt security holdings were in corporate bonds with a credit rating of A or above, as of 31 December 2010.
Wrapped credit is credit exposure that has been insured with monoline insurers to achieve a better credit rating.
The monoline insurers suffered further downgrades during 2009 and 2010 and this is reflected in the analysis that follows.
The exposure is diversified across several monolines and the underlying bonds are diversified across many different counterparties.
In general, we are a long-term holder of this debt, although we continue to review our holdings with reference to the underlying quality and prospects.
The majority of the residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS are US investments and over 85% of this exposure is backed by the US government-sponsored entities GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Under the conservatorship arrangements with the US government implemented in September 2008, these securities have an implicit guarantee, although they are not expressly backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.
The majority of the remaining US RMBS are backed by fixed-rate loans that originated in 2005 or before.
At 31 December 2010, we had no exposure to sub-prime debt securities 2009: 2 million, and our exposure to collaterised debt obligations CDO and collaterised loan obligations CLO was limited to 332 million 2009: 241 million.
Investments in structured assets excluding agency RMBS that are backed by GSEs were 6.0 billion, representing less than 4% of total debt securities.
During 2010, the proportion of our shareholder debt securities that are investment grade declined slightly to 88% 2009: 90%.
This movement was primarily due to the increase in private placements to back UK annuity liabilities.
The remaining 12.0% of shareholder debt securities that do not have an external rating of BBB or higher can be split as follows: 3.4% are debt securities that are rated as below investment grade 3.0% are US private placements which are not rated by the major ratings agencies, but are rated an average equivalent of Aby the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC, a US national regulatory agency 5.6% are not rated by the major rating agencies or the NAIC.
Of the securities not rated by an external agency or NAIC most are allocated an internal rating using a methodology largely consistent with that adopted by an external ratings agency, and are considered to be of investment grade credit quality: these include 1.8 billion 2.7% of total shareholder debt securities of private placements and other corporate bonds held in our UK Life business which have been internally rated as investment grade.
