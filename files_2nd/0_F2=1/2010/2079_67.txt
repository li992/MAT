2 Information on the Company continued Metallurgical Coal Customer Sector Group Coal Resources The table below details the total inclusive Coal Resources for the Metallurgical Coal Customer Sector Group estimated as at 30 June 2010 in 100 per cent terms unless otherwise stated.
The coal quality for Illawarra Coal, Haju, Luon, Bumbun and Juloi Northwest deposits is for in situ quality and is on an air-dried basis.
Tonnages are at an in situ moisture basis.
3 OC open-cut, UG underground, Met metallurgical coal, Th thermal coal, Anth anthracite, %VM per cent volatile matter, %S per cent sulphur.
4 Goonyella Riverside was previously referred to as Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow Some resources have been moved from OC to UG category.
This has resulted in them being reclassified from Measured to Indicated status.
5 Norwich Park Increase is largely due to the addition of resources in ML70350.
6 Blackwater Reported coal qualities are a weighted average of metallurgical coal and by-product thermal coal.
7 South Walker Creek Increases in the underground resource are based on additional drilling particularly in downdip areas.
8 Luon, Bumbun, Juloi Northwest Coal Resource is reported for the first time.

MME SME regd member 2 Only geophysically logged, fully analysed cored holes with greater than 95% recovery are used to classify the Reserves.
Drill hole spacings vary between seams and geological domains and are determined in conjunction with geostatistical analyses where applicable.
4 Total Coal Reserve tonnes is the sum of Proved and Probable Coal Reserve estimates, which includes allowances for diluting materials, and for losses that occur when the coal is mined, and are at the moisture content when mined.
Marketable Coal Reserve tonnes is the tonnage of coal available, at specified moisture and air-dried quality, for sale after the beneficiation of the Total Coal Reserve.
Note that where the coal is not beneficiated, the Total Coal Reserve tonnes are the Marketable Coal Reserve tonnes, with moisture adjustment where applicable.
5 Goonyella Riverside was previously referred to as Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow.
6 Norwich Park The increase in Marketable Coal Reserve is due to an increase in the mine plan footprint.
7 Blackwater The Total Marketable Coal Reserve includes 86Mt of thermal coal at an average 6,900 kilo-calories per kilogram kcal kg calorific value.
8 South Walker Creek The Total Marketable Coal Reserve consists of 86.1Mt of Pulverised Coal Injection PCI product and 11.4Mt thermal coal with an average calorific value of 7,700kcal kg.
9 Appin The increase in Marketable Coal Reserve is a result of exploration and expansion of the planned mining area into Appin Area 9.
10 West Cliff 10Mt of Probable Coal Reserve has been reclassified to Proved as a result of mining approvals being granted for the next three panels.
11 Dendrobium The increase in Marketable Coal Reserve is a result of revisions to the mine plan and additional drilling.
The nominal mine production rate has increased.
