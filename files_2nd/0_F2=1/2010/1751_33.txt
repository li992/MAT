Business review Babcock International Group PLC 33 Operational r Operational review continued eview continued Our framework contracts in track, signalling and telecoms continue to provide a stable platform for the business.
In support of Network Rails cost reduction targets we are discussing a move to a single incentive-based contract for track renewals in North West England and Scotland replacing the separate contracts which existed previously.
We have also recently secured one of only three telecoms framework contracts for the next 1218 months positioning us strongly for the next long-term contract which we anticipate should be awarded before the end of this financial year.
Outlook The challenges that Network Rail faces in delivering significant cost savings are driving a move to more open, collaborative type contracts.
This is a way of working in which Babcock has traditionally excelled.
Although Network Rails spend will reduce we believe there are a number of significant opportunities available to us.
In addition we will continue to try to diversify our customer base to improve stability.
However, our key imperative will continue to be the ongoing transformation of the business to deliver reduced costs, improved operational performance and increased safety.
