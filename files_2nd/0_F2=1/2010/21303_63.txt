About Barclays Strategy Performance Risk management and governance Financial statements Shareholder information Barclays PLC Annual Report 2010 www.
com annualreport10 87 Impairment Charges audited Impairment charges on loans and advances fell 24% to 5,625m 2009: 7,358m, reecting improving credit conditions in the main sectors and geographies in which Barclays lends, which led to lower charges across the majority of businesses.
The largest reduction was in the wholesale portfolios, due to lower charges against credit market exposures and fewer large single name charges.
This reduction was partially offset by the impact of deteriorating credit conditions in the Spanish property and construction sectors, which resulted in an increase of 630m in impairment against the Barclays Corporate loan book in Spain, and 532m impairment relating to the Protium loan in Barclays Capital.
In the retail portfolios, impairment performance improved as delinquency rates fell across Barclays businesses, most notably the UK, US, Spanish, Indian, and African portfolios.
As a result of this fall in impairment and the 1% rise in loans and advances, the loan loss rate decreased to 118bps 2009: 156bps.
The impairment charges against available for sale assets and reverse repurchase agreements fell by 93% to 47m 2009: 713m, principally driven by lower impairment against credit market exposures.
