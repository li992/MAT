3 The resource grades listed, Fe iron, P phosphorous, SiO silica, Al O alumina, refer to in situ mass percentage on a dry weight basis.
2 2 3 LOI loss on ignition, refers to loss of mass dry basis during the assaying process.
Wet tonnes are reported for WAIO deposits using the following moisture contents: BKM 3%, MM 4%, CID 8%, NIM 3.5%.
Where information has been extrapolated to estimate Inferred Resources the maximum extrapolation distance was 300m from the nearest drill hole.
4 Mt Newman JV New drilling and resource estimation at Jinayri BKM.
5 Jimblebar New drilling and resource estimates for South Jimblebar MM and Hashimoto BKM deposits.
6 Mt Goldsworthy JV Area C New drilling and resource estimates for Alligator South MM, D and E deposits MM, Packsaddle 3 and 6 BKM.
New deposit reported for Rocklea BKM, MM.
7 Yandi JV Additional drilling and resource estimated at Marillana BKM.
8 BHP Billiton Iron Ore Exploration is comprised of deposits located on exploration tenements owned by BHP Billiton Minerals and BHP Coal, which have previously been reported separately.
These entities have been combined to simplify reporting.
9 BHP Billiton Iron Ore Exploration New drilling and resource estimation for Mindy Mindy BKM, which has not been reported previously.
New drilling and a new resource estimate for Prairie Downs MM has increased the resource, but also downgraded previous Indicated resource to Inferred.
10 Samarco JV Changes are due to the update and integration of the resource models of Alegria North and Alegria Center, and the update of Alegria South resource model with drilling information from 2009.
In addition Germano resource 365 million wet metric tonnes is also included for the first time, based on 29 drill holes of the 2008 drilling campaign.
This year the resource is declared in wet metric tonnes, moisture content 6.5%.

4 For Western Australia Iron Ore WAIO the reserves are divided into joint ventures and material types that reflect the various products.
5 The reserve grades listed, Fe iron, P phosphorous, SiO silica, Al O alumina, LOI loss on ignition, refer to in situ mass percentage on a 2 2 3 dry weight basis.
For Samarco %Pc is phosphorous in concentrate.
For Mt Newman, Jimblebar, Mt Goldsworthy and Yandi joint ventures, tonnages represent wet tonnes based on the following moisture contents: BKM 3%, MM 4%, CID 8%, NIM 3.5%.
For Samarco the reserve tonnages also represent wet tonnes for FY2010 based on a moisture content of 6.5% for ROM.
Iron ore is marketed as Lump direct blast furnace feed, Fines sinter plant feed and direct reduction and blast furnace pellets Samarco.
6 Cut-off grades used to estimate reserves: Mt Newman 5062%Fe for BKM, 59%Fe for MM: Jimblebar 59%Fe for BKM, 58%Fe for MM: Mt Goldsworthy 50%Fe for NIM, 57%Fe for MM, 59%Fe for BKM: Yandi 5555.5%Fe for CID: Samarco Fe 34%.
7 WAIO reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine, except Cattle Gorge and Callawa part of Mt Goldsworthy JV Northern, which reside on standard Western Australian mining leases.
We are required to obtain certain State Government approvals including environmental and heritage clearances before we commence mining operations in a particular area.
We have included in our reserves, areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding, but where, based on the technical investigations we carry out as part of our mine planning process and our knowledge and experience of the approvals process, we expect that such approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current mine schedule.
8 Mt Newman JV New drilling and estimates for Jinayri BKM.
9 Jimblebar New drilling and estimates for Hashimoto BKM deposits included some confidence downgrading.
Nominal production rate has increased in 2010.
10 Mt Goldsworthy JV Area C New drilling and estimates for D and E deposits MM, Packsaddle 3 and 6 BKM.
11 Samarco JV The increase in the Samarco reserve is due to a change to a wet tonnes reporting basis and revision in the mine plan, which has coalesced and deepened the open-pit reserve.
The June 2010 Reserve Life is based on the Samarco nominal production capacity, which is supplemented by the contracted ore supply from Vale Fazendao mine until 2027.
