Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 13 Since 2009, reserves and resources amounting to 56 mmboe have been added towards the 200 mmboe target.
With further evaluation and appraisal, we estimate that this could rise to over 100 mmboe of additions.
Asia Indonesia On the Premier-operated Tuna Block, final plans were completed for the drilling of two exploration wells, Gajah Laut Utara and Belut Laut, in the first half of 2011.
- ` follow on from the nearby C Ro ng Do CRD appraisal well in the neighbouring Vietnamese block as part of a three well programme using the same drilling rig.
On Natuna Sea Block A, plans were completed for the drilling of two near-field exploration wells, Anoa Deep and Biawak Besar, scheduled for drilling in the third and fourth quarters of 2011.
A review is in progress to refine the remaining prospective resource potential of the entire block.
This study is set for completion in the first half of 2011, for incorporation into a five-year exploration plan on the block.
On Block A Aceh, plans were completed for the drilling of one exploration well, Matang, scheduled for drilling in the third quarter of 2011.
Elsewhere, on the Buton Block in Sulawesi, plans were finalised for an exploration well, Benteng, now expected to be drilled in the second half of 2011.
Vietnam Following the 2009 exploration success at CRD in Block 07 03, Premier integrated the well results into the new 3D seismic data and then sought and obtained Government of Vietnam approval for an appraisal plan for CRD.
The first appraisal well on CRD was spudded in February 2011.
Continued activity elsewhere on Block 07 03 included the acquisition of 2 900km of new 3D seismic data over the southern part of the block.
Interpretation of these data and of the previously acquired data in the east of the block will allow selection of prospects for exploration drilling in 2012.
2 In Block 104-109 05, offshore northern Vietnam, 445km of new 3D seismic data and reconnaissance 2D lines were acquired and interpreted to aid the final selection of the location for an exploration well, planned for the third quarter of 2011.
North Sea and West Africa UK In April, the Bugle North well was drilled as a joint appraisal well on the boundary of Blocks 15 23c and 15 23d.
Premier effectively paid 37 per cent of the joint well cost to earn a 50 per cent equity in 15 23d.
The well was targeting the northern extension of the Bugle oil discovery and encountered minor quantities of hydrocarbon, but these are considered insufficient to support a Bugle development at this time.
In May, the Catcher exploration discovery well 28 9-1 Premier 35 per cent encountered 80 feet of high-quality oil in the Cromarty reservoir.
Catcher East was drilled as a side-track to the main well, approximately 0.5km to the east.
This well found hydrocarbons in younger Tay sands which are in communication with the initial discovery in the Cromarty sand.
A core recovered 44 feet of net oil-bearing Tay sand with an average porosity of 34 per cent.
A second side-track, Catcher South West, encountered 68 feet of net hydrocarbon pay and a common oil water contact with the Catcher main well.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 14 Chief Executives Review continued Phase 2 of the Catcher area exploration began with the drilling of the Varadero well.
The initial analysis indicated 84 feet of net hydrocarbon pay in the main Tay sandstones, plus a further 22 feet of net pay in thinner sands above the main Tay sands.
The oil is of similar good quality to the Catcher discovery well.
Further drilling of the block is planned for the first half of 2011.
Premier concluded drilling operations on the Oates farm-in well 22 19c-6 in August, but logging from the Forties target indicated that no hydrocarbons were present.
The well was plugged and abandoned.
Premier acquired a 50 per cent equity in 22 19c from the farm-in well.
Remaining prospectivity on the block is being evaluated in light of the well result.
In October, Nexen operated the drilling of the joint exploration boundary well between West Rochelle Block 15 26c 100 per cent Endeavour and 15 26b Premier 50 per cent.
Premier earned 25 per cent of 15 26c by promoting part of the joint well.
The well confirmed oil and gas pay in excellent quality Kopervik sandstone reservoir and was subsequently side-tracked up dip.
The side-track confirmed the presence of gas-bearing Kopervik sands.
The contacts and fluids seen in the West Rochelle primary well and side-track are the same as the Rochelle discovery, suggesting a single field.
The Rochelle fields will be tied back to the Scott production facility in which Premier has a 21.83 per cent interest.
The first phase of the Rochelle development received government approval in early 2011.
In October, Premier received five licence awards across nine blocks in the UK 26th Round including two as operator.

In December, Premier paid US$2.8 million, funding 50 per cent of the cost of a seismic acquisition on the Eagle prospect licence P1212, Block 15 13b to earn a 50 per cent interest in the block.
Norway The Greater Luno extension well 16 4-5 on licence PL359 Premier 30 per cent completed drilling operations in March.
The well objective was to test the hydrocarbon potential in Jurassic age sediments and fractured basement.
The well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.
The joint venture has been granted a two-year licence extension to investigate additional prospectivity on PL359.
The Blbaer PL374S exploration well 34 5-1S Premier 15 per cent was drilled in the first quarter of 2010 on an adjacent block to the third party Jordbaer discovery.
The well successfully discovered hydrocarbons in the Cook formation and was side-tracked across a bounding fault to test an adjacent fault compartment that was water wet.
The well results are being integrated into the regional understanding and a potential appraisal campaign, as part of a tie-back to the neighbouring Jordbaer development, is being evaluated.
