Tenders for the project are under consideration with a view to commencing work later this year.
The scheme will produce a prime office building with an estimated annual rental value of not less than 5.5 million in a landmark, listed property at a total cost of some 40 million.
We continue to seek opportunities to create value within our existing property portfolio and, with this objective in mind, planning consent has been obtained to develop 15 substantial houses on land in our ownership in St Johns Wood, London.
This is a significant project and the necessary preparatory work is underway.
