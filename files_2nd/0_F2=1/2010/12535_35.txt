Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 48 Remuneration Report continued Non-executive directors continued The companys Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
Fees for non-executives are reviewed at least every two years, having regard to the size of the company and the time commitments of the non-executives.
The Board reviewed the fees of the non-executives at the end of 2010 and decided to increase them for 2011.
This recognises the steadily increasing time commitment and expertise required of the roles and, after careful consideration of benchmark data, they have been set at a level which is broadly in line with comparable businesses as follows: Other non-executive directors Senior Committee independent Chairman Basic fee chairmanship director 2010 150,000 40,000 8,000 2,000 2011 160,000 50,000 10,000 10,000 Part B: The information in this part of the report has been audited Directors emoluments Total emoluments paid to directors for the year ended 31 December 2010 was 2,951,300 2009: 2,905,600.
A contribution of 55,212 was paid in 2010 to Mr S C Locketts personal money purchase pension scheme.
Messrs R A Allan, N Hawkings and A G Lodge sacrificed 18,000, 15,000 and 6,750 of their salary respectively into the money purchase pension scheme.
Mr R A Allan was paid a non-pensionable and non-bonusable overseas premium of 75,000 relating to his position in Singapore.
Mr A R C Durrant received a non-bonusable salary supplement of 56,736 as part of his pension arrangements.
Mr A G Lodge received a non-bonusable salary supplement of 36,756 as part of his pension arrangements.
Mr N Hawkings received a non-bonusable salary supplement of 2,606 as part of his pension arrangements.
Mr R A Allan received 194,239 of expatriate benefits during the year.
The company deducts a hypothetical tax equivalent to UK tax rates on Mr R A Allans salary, bonus and long-term incentive payments.
This is used to offset against local Singapore tax due the maximum tax rate in Singapore is a lower percentage than in the UK resulting in a tax credit back to the company.
The main benefits provided are medical insurance, car allowance and a subsidised gym membership.
Shares vested and realised is the sum of the value of various share awards as at the date of vesting in relation to the AEP, matching shares and deferred annual bonus, based on performance periods stretching back as far as 2004 in some cases.
Following a review of the 2010 performance, the Committee determined that the finance and organisation targets had been achieved 20 per cent of the total maximum award and agreed a 40 per cent award out of the maximum 80 per cent in relation to the health, safety, environment and security, the production and development and the exploration and new business targets, as these targets were only partially met.
This resulted in a total bonus award of 60 per cent of salary, 30 per cent of salary paid as cash as disclosed in the table above.
In addition to the cash awards above, an equal amount is to be awarded in shares deferred for three years 2009: 85 per cent of salary, paid as 42.5 per cent cash and 42.5 per cent Deferred Shares.
The number of Deferred Shares to be awarded will be determined by reference to the mid-market closing price of Premier Oil shares on the first open day for share dealing following the companys results announcement on 24 March 2011.

Ms I J Hinkleys total remuneration in 2010 is calculated from 1 September 2010, being the date of her appointment to the Board.
Relates to non-executive director fees for Sir David John, who retired from the Board in 2009.
Pension schemes The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK, together with a defined benefit pension scheme the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members in 1997.
Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Scheme, subject to the earnings cap.
The Scheme is a funded, registered final salary scheme, which provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has operated its own cap on pensionable earnings since April 2006, when the external cap was removed.
In the Scheme, the cap is determined at 1 January each year and, for the year to 31 December 2010, this was set at 123,600 and will stay the same for the year to 31 December 2011.
In the companys money purchase pension arrangement, the cap is determined at 6 April each year and, for 2009 10 this was set at 123,600 and will stay the same for April 2010 11.
During 2010, the UK Government issued further details about the longer-term basis on which tax relief will be afforded to the provision of pension rights: in particular, the proposed reduction in the Annual Allowance and Lifetime Allowance from April 2011 and April 2012 respectively.
As a result, the company is reviewing the pension arrangements of executive directors.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the earnings cap the pension promise.
The additional value of this target pension provision, relative to the standard terms applied to employees, is made available at the directors option in the form of either an enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
As at the year-end, Messrs S C Lockett and R A Allan had elected to receive pension contributions.
Mr A R C Durrant had elected to receive a salary supplement and Messrs A G Lodge and N Hawkings had elected for a combination of the two.
Messrs A R C Durrant, A G Lodge and N Hawkings received a salary supplement, during 2010, of 56,736, 36,756 and 2,606 respectively.
Messrs R A Allan, N Hawkings and A G Lodge are members of the companys group personal pension plan.
During 2010, the company contributed 24,720, 24,720 and 18,540 respectively to this plan on their behalf.
In addition, in respect of the pension promise, the company contributed 35,280 and 32,340 respectively to Messrs R A Allans and N Hawkings pension funds with the group personal pension plan.
Mr S C Lockett has established his own personal pension plan, to which, during 2010, the company contributed 55,212 in regard to the pension promise.
This is in addition to the company contributions paid into the Scheme on his behalf.
Details of the companys contributions to these arrangements are disclosed in the emoluments table.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 50 Remuneration Report continued Pension schemes continued The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members or deemed members of the Scheme during 2010 are as follows: b d e g a Transfer value c Transfer value Increase from f Increase Accrued in respect Accrued in respect d to b less Transfer value in accrued pension as at of a as at pension as at of c as at contributions of increase pension 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December by director in accrued excluding 2010 2010 2009 2009during 2010 benefit inflation 000 pa 000 000 pa 000 000 000 000 S C Lockett 78.1 1,041.1 66.6 839.3 175.9 153.2 11.5 R A Allan 38.9 626.2 32.1 491.1 118.3 109.5 6.8 A R C Durrant 32.2 534.7 24.9 392.3 124.4 121.2 7.3 N Hawkings 25.6 393.5 18.8 274.6 102.1 104.5 6.8 A G Lodge 9.0 162.4 3.4 59.0 86.6 101.0 5.6 Notes: The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and f have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008 SI 2008 1050.
The increases under e are principally due to the additional pension accrued over the year.
The amounts under f represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
Thus, in the case of Mr A R C Durrant, who has elected not to receive enhanced pension contributions, the companys pension obligation will be met entirely by the payment of salary supplements.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: none of the directors have elected to do so.
The mid-market closing price on date of vesting was 1076.0p.
b Modified converted to restricted shares on 29 March 2010 following the accelerated vesting of the Deferred Shares for tax planning purposes.
The mid-market closing price on 29 March 2010 was 1242.0p.
c Shares sold to pay income tax and National Insurance contributions arising upon the accelerated vesting of awards but subject to clawback.
d Shares withheld in respect of a notional tax payment equivalent to UK income tax.
Any overseas tax paid on behalf of the participant in respect of the vesting of the shares is subject to clawback.
On 29 March 2010, these awards were changed from conditional awards of shares to restricted shares.
Some of the shares were sold to pay income tax and National Insurance contributions payable by Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant and A G Lodge upon the accelerated vesting of the awards, but the amounts received from the sale remain subject to clawback in the event of the participant leaving Premier, other than as a good leaver.
In the case of Mr R A Allan, who as an expatriate is not subject to UK tax, a percentage of the shares were withheld equal to the percentage tax rate that would have applied had he been subject to UK income tax.
These shares reverted to the Trust and the company will pay any overseas duties payable by Mr R A Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to clawback if Mr R A Allan leaves Premier, other than as a good leaver.
The remaining shares are held in a nominee account within the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust until the end of the original deferral period.
The shares would be forfeited if the director leaves other than as a good leaver.
The number of deferred bonus shares awarded in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were adjusted following the rights issue which took place in May 2009.
On 13 January 2011, following completion of the original deferral period, 6,664 shares, 4,793 shares, 4,810 shares and 7,369 shares were released from the Employee Benefit Trust to Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings respectively.
The published 2009 figures included an incorrect market price for the 22 January 2009 award of 714.5p.
The correct number is 741.5p which is shown in the table above.
As at the date of this report, the number of Deferred Shares to be awarded to directors for the year ended 31 December 2010 is still to be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The number of shares will be calculated by reference to the amount of the award outlined on page 48 divided by the mid-market closing price of Premier Oil shares on the first open day for share dealing following the companys results announcement on 24 March 2011.
Outstanding long-term incentive awards Asset and Equity Plan AEP The AEP expired in 2009 and the award granted in 2008, which matured at the end of 2010, was the last award remaining under the plan.
Accordingly, there are no further awards outstanding under the plan.
The AEP has two elements: the Asset Pool and the Equity Pool.
The Asset Pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the Equity Pool is created by reference to the increase in equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
In both cases, no pool is created where the compound annual growth in the relevant measure asset value or share price is below 10 per cent per annum.
At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
At 20 per cent compound growth per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
The size of the pool increases on a straight-line basis between these two points.
In addition, the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
The pool is allocated to eligible employees based on their pro rata entitlement.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 52 Remuneration Report continued 2007 award based on performance over 2007, 2008 and 2009 In relation to the 2007 AEP award, an independent external valuation of the Asset Pool was undertaken and the Committee determined the 2007 vesting level as set out in the table below.
50 per cent of the awards made to directors were released in shares and 50 per cent in deferred shares which are eligible for a Matching Award on the same basis as awards under the LTIP.
The minimum vesting threshold for the Equity Pool was not achieved resulting in this part of the award lapsing.
The market price of shares on date of award was 1211.0p.
The Matching Awards granted during the year relate to the Deferred Shares and are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria.
The market price was 1214.0p on the date of grant of Matching Awards.
2008 award based on performance over 2008, 2009 and 2010 The executive directors have been allocated the following points under the 2008 award out of a total of 7,634.60 points currently outstanding: Number of participation points S C Lockett 310 R A Allan 205 A R C Durrant 205 N Hawkings 205 1 A G Lodge 113.9 Note: 1.
Mr A G Lodge received compensatory points under the 2008 award following his appointment to the Board on 20 April 2009.
The Equity Pool of the 2008 award was calculated by comparing the market capitalisation calculated by reference to the average share price for the three months prior to the date of award 1 January 2008, with the market capitalisation similarly calculated to 31 December 2010.
Growth over this period was equivalent to 24.3 per cent pa compound.
The Asset Pool of the 2008 award was calculated following the sign-off of the year-end results.
Growth over this period was equivalent to 12.48 per cent pa compound.
In line with the rules of the plan, which state that a 2x salary cap on payouts may be lifted on such proportionate basis as it determines where growth in either pool is in excess of 20 per cent pa compound, the Committee determined that the cap should be increased to 243 per cent of salary.
If it is determined that the minimum vesting threshold has been achieved, half of any executive directors vested award will be received in shares and the other half in the form of an award of Deferred Shares which are eligible for a Matching Award on the same basis as awards under the LTIP, which will vest three years later.
