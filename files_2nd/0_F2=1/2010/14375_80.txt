Directors Indemnity Arrangements Appropriate directors and officers liability insurance is in place and Deeds of Indemnity have been entered into between the Company and directors and certain directors of some subsidiary companies.
The Deeds of Indemnity allow for indemnification of directors in respect of proceedings brought by third parties and for the Company to provide funds for directors ongoing costs in defending a legal action as they are incurred rather than after judgement has been given.
Individual directors would still be liable to pay any damages awarded to the Company in an action against them and to repay their defence costs to the extent funded by the Company if their defence were unsuccessful.
