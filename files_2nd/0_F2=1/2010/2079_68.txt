Qualities and tonnages are reported on an in situ air-dried basis.
4 Leandra North The resource is now based on a select mining horizon instead of the full seam height.
5 Leandra South The increase in resources is mainly due to the re-evaluation of the No.
2 Seam, which was previously not included in the resources.
6 Theunissen The change in resource is the result of a review of the geological model following additional drilling.
7 T-Project Additional drilling resulted in a revised structural interpretation of the coal deposit.
8 Remainder Block IV The change in resource is the result of a review of the geological model following additional drilling.
9 Cerrejn Coal Company A review of the geological model and classification has been undertaken and incorporated into the June 2010 statement.

4 Total Coal Reserve tonnes is the sum of Proved and Probable Coal Reserve estimates, which includes allowances for diluting materials, and for losses that occur when the coal is mined, and are at the moisture content when mined.
Marketable Coal Reserve tonnes is the tonnage of coal available, at specified moisture and air-dried quality, for sale after the beneficiation of the Total Coal Reserves.
Note that where the coal is not beneficiated, the Total Coal Reserve tonnes are the Marketable Coal Reserve tonnes, with moisture adjustment where applicable.
5 %VM per cent volatile matter, %S per cent sulphur, kcal kg CV kilo-calories per kilogram calorific value.
6 Marketable coal moisture content is on an as received basis.
7 Khutala The increase in OC reserve of thermal coal is due to a re-evaluation of the mine plan.
Some blocks previously scheduled as underground are now going to be mined by open-cut methods.
8 Mt Arthur Coal Marketable Coal Reserve has increased due to changes in the product specification, an increase in the wash plant yield and partial plant bypass strategy.
9 Cerrejn Coal Company The reduction in the Marketable Coal Reserve is due to review and updating of the geological confidence, modifications to pit design, changes to wash plant yield and production depletion.
