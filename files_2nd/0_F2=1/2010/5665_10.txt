30 Unlocking Resources Our Divisions Overview Ferroalloys Iron Ore Alumina and Aluminium Revenue 2010 Revenue 2010 Revenue 2010 US$2,988m US$1,875m US$906m The Ferroalloys Division produces and sells The Iron Ore Division consists of the The Alumina and Aluminium Division ferrochrome, as well as other ferroalloys, for Sokolov-Sarbai Mining Production produces and sells the Groups own use as alloying products in the production of Association SSGPO in the Republic of aluminium and also sells alumina to other steel, whilst manganese and chrome ore are Kazakhstan, as well as Bahia Minerals BV aluminium producers.
ENRC believes, based sold to third-party producers of ferroalloys as BMBV, Minerao Minas Bahia SA MIBA on 2010 data, that the Alumina and Aluminium well as to the chemical industry.
ENRC is the and a 51% interest in Minerao Peixe Bravo Division is the worlds ninth largest supplier largest ferrochrome producer in the world by SA MPB in Brazil.
SSGPO produces and of traded alumina by volume and is at the chrome content and the lowest cost producer sells iron ore concentrate and pellet primarily lower end of the global industry cost curve of high-carbon ferrochrome.
The Ferroalloys to steel producers.
On the basis of 2010 data for alumina and aluminium.
The Alumina Division is vertically integrated, having its SSGPO is believed to be a material exporter and Aluminium Divisions vertically integrated own chrome ore and manganese ore mines of iron ore and in the lowest quartile of the operations include: bauxite mines: a limestone feeding its ferroalloy production in Kazakhstan, cost curve.
The Iron Ore Divisions operations mine: an alumina refinery: an aluminium Russia and China.
In addition to its own ore, in Kazakhstan include iron ore mines, crushing, smelter: and a power station.
The smelter the Division also benefits from competitively beneficiation and pelletising plants and a allows the Alumina and Aluminium Division priced electricity supplied by the Energy thermal power station.
BMBV is focused to process its own alumina into aluminium Division, as well as having a gas-fired power on the development of an iron ore deposit and Phase 2 of the smelter, with a total annual station at its Aktobe plant in Kazakhstan.
