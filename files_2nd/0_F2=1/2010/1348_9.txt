business and financial review continued k ey performance indicators We constantly review our strategy and our business performance to ensure we are delivering against our stated objectives.
At Group level, we measure the performance of the business using a number of key performance indicators as shown in the charts below.
Certain KPIs are more appropriately measured for each of our two operating businesses, whereas other KPIs are best measured for the Group as a whole.
Physical utilisation % Physical utilisation % Physical utilisation is measured as the daily average of the amount of itemised fleet at cost on 71 69 rent as a percentage of the total fleet at cost and for Sunbelt is measured only for equipment whose 68 67 cost is over $7,500 which comprised 90% of its serialised fleet at 30 April 2010.
66 64 It is important to sustain annual average physical utilisation at between 60% and 70% through the cycle.
If utilisation falls below 60% then yield will tend to suffer, whilst above 70% we may not have enough fleet in certain stores to meet our customers needs.
08 09 10 Aided by winter 2008 9s fleet downsizing around 10% in each business and subsequent Sunbelt A-Plant adjustments, average 2009 10 physical utilisation remained healthy all year despite difficult markets.
Fleet on rent m Fleet on rent $ m Fleet on rent is measured as the daily average of the original cost of our itemised equipment on 1,548 1,515 1,368 rent.
Original cost, rather than net book value, is used because it correlates more directly with rental income as rental rates vary only slightly with the age of the item being rented.
Fleet on rent measures the activity within our business and also provides an indication of market 245 245 221 share.
In 2009 10, fleet on rent declined 10% in both businesses which is a smaller reduction than the reported decline in US and UK construction volume.
Our decline in fleet on rent is also smaller 08 09 10 than that reported by our major US peers.
Accordingly, we believe we continued to gain market share in the past year.
Sunbelt A-Plant Change in yield % Change in yield % Yield is measured as the change in our rental revenues which is not explained by the change in 19 volume of fleet on rent.
Yield is therefore an all encompassing measure which captures changes in 11 rental rates, changes in delivery charges and other ancillary rental revenues, together with changes in both the customer mix larger customers generally pay lower rates and the mix of equipment.
-5 -8 Yield declined 16% at Sunbelt and by 12% at A-Plant in the past year reflecting cost pressures in the -12 recession and the actions of certain, financially distressed, competitors.
Recently these pressures eased -16 somewhat, particularly in the US where the yield decline was 5% in the fourth quarter.
08 09 10 Sunbelt A-Plant Underlying EBITDA margins % Underlying EBITDA margins % Underlying EBITDA margins are measured before exceptional costs.
Underlying EBITDA correlates 36.8 34.5 closely in our business with our top line cash flow and is therefore an important measure of our 32.5 30.8 30.2 financial health.
Given the cyclicality of our revenues, it is also important that we adjust our cost base as far as practicable to limit any reduction in our underlying EBITDA margin when revenues 25.9 are declining.
We view our margin performance in 2009 10 as very strong with the margin decline limited 08 09 10 to 2% in Sunbelt and 4% in A-Plant, despite the substantial revenue reductions we suffered.
The rightsizing programme we effected in winter 2008 9 meant that both businesses were Sunbelt A-Plant well prepared for the challenges of the recession.
19 Underlying Eps p Underlying EPS p Underlying EPS is a key measure of short-term financial performance for the Group as a whole.
14.8 11.9 It is measured before exceptional costs, amortisation of acquired intangibles and fair value remeasurements.
The decline from 2008 reflects the effects of the severe recession experienced over the last two years.
The cyclical nature of the markets we serve and our balance sheet structure, which involves us carrying a significant interest cost, mean that underlying EPS varies 0.2 substantially through the cycle.
08 09 10 Return on investment % Return on investment % In a capital intensive business, profitability is not the only measure of performance as it is possible 13.8 13.6 13.2 11.5 to generate good margins but poor value for shareholders if assets are not deployed efficiently.
10.7 9.7 Return on investment RoI measures both profitability and capital efficiency and is calculated as underlying operating profit divided by net tangible and intangible assets employed excluding 4.6 net debt, deferred tax and fair value remeasurements.
Averaged across the economic cycle we look to deliver RoI well ahead of our cost of capital.
However, in the past two years the recession has adversely impacted our returns.
Our returns in the strong markets 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 of 2006 and 2007 were also limited by our acquisition in August 2006 of NationsRent whose RoI, when acquired, was significantly below that of Sunbelt which necessarily took us some time to correct.
Net debt and leverage at constant exchange rates Net debt and leverage m We seek to maintain a conservative balance sheet structure with a target range for net debt to 1,230 1,199 1,193 Net debt m underlying EBITDA through the cycle of 23 times.
At 30 April 2010, at constant exchange rates, Leverage leverage at 3.1 times was just outside our target range as we had always anticipated could be the 3.1 1,003 3.3 case at the bottom of a deep recession.
Our debt leverage is substantially lower than that of all 2.9 our major US peers, affording us good flexibility for the future.
829 2.6 2.6 We also aim to sustain significant availability the difference between the amount we are able to borrow under our asset-based facility at any time and the amount drawn through the cycle.
Aug Apr Apr Apr Apr 06 07 08 09 10 Availability at 30 April 2010 was $537m which both ensures all our debt remains effectively covenant free and also provides us with substantial headroom for future investment.
Staff turnover % Staff turnover % We are a service business that differentiates itself by the strength of our service offering.
29 25 Central to this service offering are our people.
Staff retention is a reasonable indicator of how 21 18 our employees feel about our Company.
While it is not unexpected that employee turnover 16 14 declines in a recession, we are nonetheless pleased with the ongoing reduction given the pressure our people are under to deliver in difficult market conditions.
Staff turnover is calculated as the number of leavers in a year excluding redundancies divided 08 09 10 by the average headcount during the year.
Sunbelt A-Plant Safety % Safety Our business involves frequent movement and maintenance of large and heavy pieces of 3.4 3.2 3.0 equipment, often in confined spaces.
Rigorous safety processes are essential if we are to avoid accidents which could cause injury to our people and damage our reputation.
1.5 In the chart we have plotted the OSHA reportable incident rate for Sunbelt and the RIDDOR 1.0 0.6 reportable incident rate for A-Plant, in each of the past three years.
While increased pressure on our businesses during the recession resulted in an increase in A-Plant this year, we believe 08 09 10 our continued focus on health and safety will reduce incident rates in the future.
