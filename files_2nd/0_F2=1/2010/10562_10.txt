Industrial lasers 30 years We have been designing ceramic components and reflectors for lasers for the last 30 years.
Electronic components Consumer devices from HD-TVs manufacturing We work with the worlds leading Our high-volume ceramics are to PCs require higher capacity Semiconductor manufacturers industrial laser manufacturers used to produce wire-wound storage without increasing disk use our advanced materials to to develop robust ceramic RF inductors and shapes for size.
This requires extremely enable them to work at higher components which improve many electronic applications, accurate control of the read write temperatures and achieve system performance.
Our yellow including mobile phones, head.
Our piezoceramic actuator higher purity levels to increase reflector glaze provides increased laptops, HD-TVs, lighting plates enable the head to be production yields.
One recent efficiency and reliability and controls, circuit board overhead positioned with extraordinary development is our Sharkskin extends lifespan, while improving protection, thermo-controls, accuracy and vibration control.
surface treatment technology, output power by 9%.
Our gas sensors, wireless devices and which prevents process residues discharge igniter uses 99.5% energy harvesting.
We also on chamber components from purity alumina ceramic for produce glass for high-quality flaking off onto the wafer, carbon dioxide CO lasers, hermetically sealed components 2 thereby significantly improving creating a robust assembly for for the military and industrial yields and decreasing processhigh temperatures and harsh markets.
