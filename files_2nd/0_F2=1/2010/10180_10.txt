BUSINESS REVIEW SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Having maintained our business platform during the economic downturn and retained our experienced and talented people, the Group was well positioned to bene t from the economic recovery during 2010.
The diversi cation of the Group, both geographically and by discipline, has proved advantageous as the recovery has developed.
Through the utilisation of spare capacity, the Groups pro tability has improved signi cantly.
We have maintained a strong balance sheet and, while increasing the returns to shareholders, we have also continued to take a long-term approach by making signi cant investments in the future of the business, both during 2010 and at the start of 2011.
Following the launch of new businesses in Chile, Qatar, Malaysia and India, we now operate in 32 countries.
With the increase in headcount of 949 during 2010 and a further 258 in the first two months of 2011, achievable because of the strength and depth of our management, we are well positioned to continue our growth.
Since the start of 2011 we have seen strong growth in our EMEA region, Australia and North America and steady growth in our UK business where market conditions remain tough but stable.
We continue to achieve our highest rates of growth in our Asian and Latin American regions where we have market leading positions.
We will next update the market on our first quarter trading in an announcement on 11 April 2011.
