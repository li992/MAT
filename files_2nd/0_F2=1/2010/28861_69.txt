Outlook for 2011 Whilst there have been improvements in the state of the global economy over the course of 2010, the outlook for 2011 remains uncertain.
In line with meeting the objectives of the strategic plan, the Group is actively focusing on closing the customer funding gap, continuing to exit Non-Core businesses and reducing undrawn and contingent commitments.
These actions will result in a reduction in the need for short-term wholesale funding: the Group is targeting 150 billion by 2013 compared with 157 billion at the end of 2010.
The Group will continue to reduce reliance on government supported schemes and be governed by the state of the markets and economies in which it operates.
These strategies are aimed at insuring that the Group is more resilient to any further disruptions in the market and better placed to take advantage of favourable trading conditions as they return.
