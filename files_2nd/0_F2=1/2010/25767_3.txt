American pp01 19 American pp01 19 09 03 2011 15:41 Page 5 Investment Managers Report Market Review After a strong second half recovery, 2010 was a rewarding year for US equity investors with the S&P 500 Index returning 14.7% in US dollar total return terms and 18.3% in sterling terms.
By late December the equity market had fully recouped all the losses that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the recession that followed.
2010 marked another step in the recovery for US equities.
The performance of the index does not, however, fully reflect the further strong performance from the US corporate sector which, in the end, overcame macro-economic worries.
Operating earnings are likely to have risen by 38% and are well above the levels most were predicting at the start of the year.
Strong operating leverage combined with a recovery in revenues drove profit margins close to all time highs.
A slowly improving domestic economic backdrop and continued growth in the emerging world all helped, while the typical American company has managed costs aggressively through the downturn and is experiencing a very strong recovery in profits as demand now picks up.
The Companys net asset value total return rose by 17.8%, a 0.5 percentage point underperformance against our benchmark, the S&P 500 Index.
Overall Asset Allocation and Performance The investment management team is responsible for managing the allocation between the two investment portfolios, together with the levels of cash and gearing.
In recent years your investment team has worked closely with the Board of Directors to develop modelling tools to assist in both asset allocation and gearing decisions.
In 2010, the Companys gearing ranged between 104% and 111% of shareholders funds, with the level at the year end being 104%.
The level of gearing has been adjusted at regular intervals within the gearing guidelines laid down by the Board to reflect the outlook on risk and return for both equities and bonds.
We maintained a relatively high level throughout most of 2010 as our gearing asset allocation model favoured equities.
We reduced the level in late November as equities had gone through a period of outperformance, leading us to lower our risk appetite.
The weighting in the smaller companies portfolio ranged between 6.9% and 7.7% of the Companys total assets less current liabilities and ended the year at 7.3%.
We believe that our ability to move between the two segments enhances potential returns to shareholders.
Attribution data for 2010 in the table overleaf shows that there were positive contributions from the smaller companies portfolio and from our active management of gearing.
The larger companies portfolio underperformed by 2.1% primarily as a result of our overweight exposure to stocks with value characteristics which did not perform as well as we had expected.
Further details on the larger and smaller companies portfolios are shown below.
Large Companies Portfolio Our investment methodology continues to focus on investing in high quality, reasonably valued companies.
This style leads us to invest in companies that exhibit good growth characteristics with growing earnings, strong cash flows and reasonable valuations.

The Company announced that it will buy Qwest Communications for $10.6 billion in stock, making it the third largest provider of traditional local phone service in the United States.
CenturyLink generates significant cash flow, and we believe the transaction with Qwest will further strengthen its prospects.
Within energy, the portfolios oil service stocks contributed the most with an overweight position in National Oilwell Varco adding the most value.

Smaller Companies Portfolio Small companies outpaced large companies in 2010 with the Russell 2000 Growth Index returning 27.4% in US dollar total return terms.
Over the course of the year the smaller companies portfolio benefited from the market rewarding higher growth and had a positive effect on the overall performance of the Company.
Stock selection drove relative returns, primarily from the consumer discretionary and producer durables sectors.
Within the smaller companies portfolio, we are finding opportunities across many sectors at this time.
The fundamentals remain in good shape with growth stocks looking particularly attractive.
As a result, the companies with the potential to grow the most are carrying a valuation rating that, unusually, is very similar to the rest of the market.
The portfolios largest overweight remains technology as we continue to have high conviction in stocks associated with cloud computing, internet security, and data storage.
As has been the case since the middle of the year, the portfolio is underweight in the consumer sector.
Tougher competition, higher input costs and lower margins cause us to be slightly cautious.
Overall, the fundamentals of smaller companies continue to be strong and we are encouraged by the current opportunities to invest in high quality companies that have potential for sustainable growth.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 7 American pp01 19 American pp01 19 09 03 2011 15:41 Page 8 Investment Managers Report continued Outlook At the start of last year, we expected 2010 to be a year of at least average market returns.
With a total return of 14.7% in US dollar terms for the S&P 500, this turned out to be a pretty reasonable forecast.
We now expect market returns to be reasonable over the next 12 months and at least up to the typical long-term expectations of 8-10% gains.
We think the corporate sector is in very good shape with profitability set to make further gains in 2011, although the rate of improvement will surely slow down as margins approach previous peaks.
Furthermore, the market still doesnt look expensive, especially in relation to bonds, with a level of equity risk premium well above the levels that have been typical of the last 25 years.
Domestic equity mutual fund flows, for example, remained negative until the very end of 2010, with the 54-month period of bond funds outselling active equity funds only broken in November.
So there appears to be plenty of room for this new found confidence in the outlook to translate into stronger retail investment flows into the stock market.
However, as the consensus becomes more optimistic and prices become more demanding, we do have to pay increasing attention to the risks.
The global backdrop is becoming more challenging.
Unresolved European sovereign debt issues are obviously troubling, and the lack of progress or political will to address the US Federal deficit runs the risk that sooner or later similar concerns will be reflected in our markets here.
Meanwhile, inflation is becoming a reality in the emerging economies that have been such a source of strength to the global economy and US corporate profits over the past few years, and action to correct that inflation is likely to cause uncertainty and volatility in the year ahead.
In addition, the turmoil unfolding in North Africa and the Middle East will be a key determinant of market sentiment in the near term.
At home, we think the housing market is stabilising but dont see much improvement in sight, while unemployment will likely improve at a very slow rate.
We believe that the Federal Reserve is likely to keep short-term interest rates at these low levels, unless there is an unexpected spike in US inflation.
Corporate profitability is already rising, and individual consumers appear to exude increasing confidence.
Both should sustain the momentum of recovery in 2011.
