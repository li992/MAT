This unites the Groups resources and in particular focuses the efforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, finance and the community.
Its prime focus is as a management tool for the Company so that there is appropriate balance in the tradeoffs that need to be made between the main levers of management such as operations measures, financial measures or delivery of customer metrics.
It therefore enables the business to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders.
For the owners of the business, it is simply based around the philosophy that if we look after customers and staff well and operate efficiently and effectively then shareholders interests will always be best served by the inevitable outputs of those growth in sales, profits and returns.
