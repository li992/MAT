77089 ASCOT TxtV9 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 26 01 2011 15:24 Page 21 Directors Report The Directors have pleasure in submitting the Annual Report and Accounts of the Company for the year to 31 December 2010. Business Review Investment Objective The objective of ASCoT is to achieve a net asset value total return with dividends reinvested greater than on the RBS Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index Excluding Investment Companies over the long term.
Investment Policy The Company aims to achieve its objective and to diversify risk by investing in over 80 small UK quoted companies.
Small companies are those having a market capitalisation, at time of purchase, equal to or lower than the largest company in the bottom 10% of the main UK equity market or companies in the RBS Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index Excluding Investment Companies.
The upper market capitalisation limit to this index at 1 January 2011 the date of the last annual index rebalancing was 1.327 billion, although this limit will change owing to movements in the stockmarket.
The aggregate market capitalisation of the index as at 1 January 2011 was 143 billion and includes 430 companies.
The Company may, at time of purchase, invest up to 15% of its assets in any one security although, in practice, each investment will typically be substantially less and, at market value, represent less than 5% of the portfolio on an ongoing basis.
If any company held by ASCoT no longer falls within the definition of a small company, as defined above, its securities will become candidates for sale.
The Managers aim to keep the Company near fully invested in equities at all times and there will normally be no attempt to engage in market timing by holding high levels of liquidity.
The Companys policy towards companies quoted on the Alternative Investment Market AIM generally precludes investment except in the circumstances where either an investee company moves from the Main Market to AIM so as to avoid being a forced seller or where a company quoted on AIM has committed to move from AIM to the Main Market so as to enable investment before a full listing is obtained.
The Company does not invest in any unquoted securities nor any securities issued by investment trusts or investment companies.
The Board, in conjunction with the Managers, is responsible for determining the gearing strategy for the Company.
Gearing is used tactically in order to enhance returns when this is considered appropriate.
The Companys Articles of Association limit borrowings to 100% of Shareholders funds although the Board would anticipate any gearing to be substantially below this limit.
The Board believes that small UK quoted companies continue to provide opportunities for positive total return over the long term.
Any material changes to the Companys investment objective and policy will be subject to Shareholder approval.
A detailed analysis of the investment portfolio is contained in the Managers Report and Portfolio Information contained on pages 7 to 17.
Investment Strategy and Style The portfolio is diversified and will normally comprise investments in over 80 individual companies.
The Managers investment style is to focus on value investing, an approach that has been developed over time that does not use any one style or sub-set of value investing.
In seeking investments, the approach will be fundamental in nature, involving regular contact with the management of prospective and existing investments, in conjunction with rigorous financial and business analysis of these companies.
The Managers recognise that different types of businesses perform better than others depending on the stage of the economic cycle and this is incorporated into the portfolio.
Therefore, the emphasis within the portfolio will reflect the desire to invest in companies whose shares represent relatively attractive value within a given stockmarket environment.
The sectoral disposition of the portfolio is a result of the bottom-up stock selection process and there are no sectoral constraints, though a top-down risk assessment is undertaken regularly.
Debt Facility In July 2010, the Board negotiated improved terms attached to the facility of 75 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland.
The bank debt facility of 75 million can be used at any time.
As at 31 December 2010, the Company had drawn down 51.75 million under the facility.
Further information can be found in Note 11.
21 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 26 01 2011 15:24 Page 22 Directors Report Corporate Structure, Governance and Regulation The Company is an investment company as defined with the meaning of Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006 and manages its affairs so as to qualify as an investment trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
It has a fixed share capital although, subject to Shareholder approval sought annually, it may purchase its own Shares.
The Company is listed and its Shares trade on The London Stock Exchange.
Furthermore the Company is subject to the laws and regulations relating to UK listed companies.
It is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that there is effective stewardship of the Companys affairs.
In common with the majority of investment trusts, the Company has no executive directors nor any employees.
However, the Board has engaged external firms to undertake the investment management, secretarial and custodial activities of the Company.
The Corporate Governance Report within this annual report contains a thorough review of the Companys stance on corporate governance.
Continuation of the Company The Company has no fixed duration.
However, in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association an ordinary resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2011 and, if passed, at every third subsequent Annual General Meeting that the Company continues to manage its affairs as an investment trust.
If such resolution is not passed, the Directors will prepare and submit to Shareholders for approval by special resolution proposals for the unitisation or appropriate reconstruction of the Company.
In putting forward such proposals the Directors will seek, inter alia, to provide Shareholders with a means whereby they can defer any liability to capital gains tax on their investment at that time.
If these proposals are not approved, Shareholders will, within 180 days of the relevant Annual General Meeting, have the opportunity of passing an ordinary resolution requiring the Company to be wound up.
On a winding up, after meeting the liabilities of the Company, the surplus assets will be paid to the holders of Ordinary Shares and distributed, pro rata, among such holders.
Investment Trust Status The Company is exempt from corporation tax on capital profits, provided it qualifies as an investment trust.
In summary, this requires that: the Companys revenue including dividend and interest income but excluding profits losses on sale of investments should be derived wholly or mainly from shares and securities: the Company must not retain in respect of each accounting period more than 15% of its income from shares and securities: no investment in a company may represent more than 15% by value of the Companys investment portfolio at time of purchase: realised profits on sale of shares and securities may not be distributed by way of a dividend: and the Company must not be a close company.
The Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an investment trust up to 31 December 2009.
It is the opinion of the Directors that the Company has subsequently conducted its affairs so as to enable it to continue to seek such approval.
The Company will continue to seek approval each year under Sections 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
Management Aberforth Partners LLP, a limited liability partnership, provides investment management, administration and company secretarial services to the Company.
These services can be terminated by either party at any time by giving six months notice of termination.
Compensation fees would be payable in respect of this six month period only if termination were to occur sooner.
Aberforth Partners LLP receives a quarterly management fee, payable in advance, equal to 0.2% of the total net assets of the Company.
However, the total fee paid each year may be slightly higher or lower than 0.8% depending on the movements in the value of the Companys assets during the year.
The Company also pays a quarterly secretarial fee, payable in advance, which amounted to 16,662 excluding VAT per quarter during 2010.
The secretarial fee is adjusted annually in line with the Retail Prices Index and is subject to VAT which is currently irrecoverable by the Company.
22 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 26 01 2011 15:24 Page 23 Directors Report The Board considers the Companys investment management and secretarial arrangements on an ongoing basis and a formal review is conducted annually by the Audit and Management Engagement Committee the Committee.
The Committee specifically considers the following topics in its review: investment performance in relation to the investment policy and strategy: the continuity of personnel managing the assets and reporting to the Board: the alignment of interests between the investment manager and the Companys Shareholders: the level of service provided in terms of the accuracy and timeliness of reports to the Board: and, the frequency and quality of both verbal and written communications with Shareholders.
Following the most recent review the Board, upon the recommendation of the Committee, is of the opinion that the continued appointment of Aberforth Partners LLP as investment managers, on the terms agreed, is in the best interests of Shareholders as a whole.
Capital Structure and Share Buy-Backs At 31 December 2010, the Companys authorised share capital consisted of 333,299,254 Ordinary Shares of 1p of which 96,366,792 were issued and fully paid.
During the year, 500,208 shares with a nominal value of 5,002 were bought back 0.52% of the Companys issued share capital and cancelled at a total cost of 2,746,000.
No shares are held in treasury.
Subject to the requirement that purchases by the Company of its own shares will be made only at a level that enhances the net asset value NAV, the principal objective of any such purchase will be to seek to sustain as low a discount between the Companys NAV and share price as seems possible.
Accordingly, it is the Boards intention to continue to use the share purchase facility within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
Voting Rights At Shareholder meetings and on a show of hands, every Shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote and, on a poll, every Shareholder present in person has one vote for each share he she holds and a proxy has one vote for every share in respect of which he she is appointed.
The deadline for proxy appointments is 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, or any adjourned meeting.
Return and Dividends The total return attributable to Shareholders for the year amounted to a gain of 151,017,000 2009 181,385,000.
The net asset value per ordinary share at 31 December 2010 was 743.81p 2009 605.90p.
Your Board is pleased to declare a second interim dividend, in lieu of a final dividend, of 13.0p, which produces total dividends for the year of 19.0p, unchanged on the total for the previous year.
The second interim dividend of 13.0p per share will be paid on 25 February 2011 to Shareholders on the register at the close of business on 4 February 2011.
000 000 Revenue return for the year available for dividends 17,512 Dividends in respect of the revenue available: First interim dividend of 6.0p per Ordinary Share paid 2 April 2010 5,812 Second interim dividend of 13.0p per Ordinary Share payable 25 February 2011 12,528 18,340 Transfer from reserves 828 Key Performance Indicators The Board assesses the Companys performance in meeting its objective against the following key performance indicators: i Net asset value total return ii Share price total return iii Performance attribution iv Share price discount v Revenue and dividend position A record of these measures is shown on pages 9, 18 and 19.
In addition to the above, the Board considers the performance of the Company against its investment trust peer group.
23 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 26 01 2011 15:24 Page 24 Directors Report Review of Performance, activity during the year and the investment outlook A comprehensive review can be found in the Chairmans Statement and Managers Report.
Principal Risks and Risk Management The Directors have established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Company.
This process was in operation during the year and continues in place up to the date of this report.
The Board believes that the Company has a relatively low risk profile in the context of the investment trust industry.
This belief arises from the fact that the Company has a simple capital structure: invests only in small UK quoted companies: has never been exposed to derivatives and does not presently intend any such exposure: and outsources all the main operational activities to recognised, well-established firms.
Investment in small companies is generally perceived to carry more risk than investment in large companies.
While this is reasonable when comparing individual companies, it is much less so when comparing the volatility of returns from diversified portfolios of small and large companies.
The Board believes the Companys portfolio is diversified.
In addition, since returns from small and large companies are not perfectly correlated, there is an opportunity for investors to reduce risk by holding portfolios of both small and large companies together.
As the Companys investments consist of small UK quoted companies, the principal risks facing the Company are market related and include market price, interest rate, and liquidity risk.
An explanation of these risks and how they are managed is contained in Note 18 to the Accounts.
Additional risks faced by the Company, together with the approach taken by the Board towards them, have been summarised as follows: i Investment objective is to achieve a net asset value total return with dividends reinvested greater than on the RBS Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index Excluding Investment Companies over the long term.
The performance of the investment portfolio will often not match the performance of the benchmark.
However, the Boards aim is to achieve the investment objective over the long term whilst managing risk by ensuring the investment portfolio is managed appropriately.
The Corporate Governance Report provides additional information regarding the various areas considered by the Board.
ii Investment policy a risk facing the Company is inappropriate sector and stock selection leading to underperformance relative to the benchmark.
The Managers have a clearly defined investment philosophy and manage a diversified portfolio.
Furthermore, performance against the benchmark and the peer group is regularly monitored by the Board.
The Company may also be affected by events or developments in the economic environment generally, for example inflation or deflation, recession and movements in interest rates.
iii Share price discount investment trust shares tend to trade at discounts to their underlying net asset values.
The Board and the Managers monitor the discount on a daily basis.
iv Regulatory risk failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could lead to suspension of the Companys share price listing, financial penalties or a qualified audit report.
Breach of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 could lead to the Company being subject to capital gains tax.
The Board receives quarterly compliance reports from the Secretaries to monitor compliance with rules and regulations.
v Operational Financial risk failure of the Managers accounting systems or those of other third party service providers could lead to an inability to provide accurate reporting and monitoring, or potentially lead to the misappropriation of assets.
The Board reviews regular reports on the internal controls of the Managers and other key third party providers.
vi Gearing risk in rising markets, the effect of borrowings would be beneficial but in falling markets the gearing effect would adversely affect returns to Shareholders.
In summary, the Board regularly considers risks associated with the Company, the measures in place to monitor them and the possibility of any other risks that may arise.
24 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 77089 ASCOT TxtV9 26 01 2011 15:24 Page 25 Directors Report Other Matters Going Concern In accordance with the Going Concern and Liquidity Risk : Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued by the Financial Reporting Council, the Directors have undertaken and documented a rigorous assessment of whether the company is a going concern.
The Directors considered all available information when undertaking the assessment, in particular, the continuation vote and operational factors.
The Companys continuation as an investment trust company remains subject to Shareholder approval at the 2011 AGM.
The Directors have considered investor sentiment and indeed the provision of the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice in relation to this matter.
The companys business activities, capital structure and borrowing facility, together with the factors likely to affect its development, performance and position are set out in the Managers Report and the Business Review.
In addition, the notes to the financial statements include the companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable equity securities which, if necessary, can be sold to meet any funding requirements though funding flexibility can typically be achieved through the use of the bank debt facility.
The company has appropriate financial resources to enable it to meet its day-to-day working capital requirements and the Directors believe that the company is well placed to continue to manage its business risks.
The Directors consider that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In summary and taking into consideration all available information, the Directors have concluded it is appropriate to continue to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Directors The Directors who held office at 31 December 2010 and their interests in the Shares of the Company as at that date and 1 January 2010 were as follows: Ordinary Shares Directors Nature of Interest 31 December 2010 1 January 2010 Prof P R Marsh Beneficial 25,000 25,000 H N Buchan Beneficial 19,474 19,474 M L A Chiappelli Beneficial 29,173 29,173 J E G Cran Beneficial 31,684 30,590 D J Jeffcoat Beneficial 4,438 4,438 Prof W S Nimmo Beneficial 25,656 25,656 D R Shaw retired 3 March 2010 Beneficial 37,000 There has been no change in the beneficial or non-beneficial holdings of the Directors between 31 December 2010 and 26 January 2011.

Annual General Meeting Special Resolutions Purchase of Own Shares The current authority of the Company to make market purchases of up to 14.99% of the issued Ordinary Shares of the Company expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 10, as set out in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting, seeks renewal of such authority until the Annual General Meeting in 2012.
The price paid for Shares will not be less than the nominal value of 1p per Share and the maximum price shall be the higher of i 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the Shares for the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase and ii the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out.
Any Shares purchased under the authority will be automatically cancelled, rather than being held in treasury, thereby reducing the Companys issued share capital.
There are no outstanding options warrants to subscribe for equity shares in the capital of the Company.
As mentioned above, subject to the requirement that purchases by the Company of its own Shares will be made only at a level which enhances NAV, the principal objective of any such purchase will be to seek to sustain as low a discount between the Companys NAV and share price as seems possible.
Accordingly, it is the Boards intention to use the share purchase facility within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
Directors Recommendation The Directors consider each resolution being proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be in the best interests of Shareholders as a whole and they unanimously recommend that all Shareholders vote in favour of them, as they intend to do so in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.
