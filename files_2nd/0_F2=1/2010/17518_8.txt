Xstratas first Mineral Resource estimate for El Pachn was published in March 2008, and a Mineral Resource increase was announced in August 2009.
In December 2010, Xstrata Copper published a further 30% increase to Mineral Resources at El Pachn, which now total 1.79 billion tonnes at a copper grade of 0.51%, using a 0.2% cut-off grade.
The current work programme is focused on completing the environmental and social impact assessment and progressing geological and metallurgic studies as part of a programme to update the El Pachn feasibility study, which is due for completion in 2012.

McArthur River Mine Expansion zinc: McArthur River Mine is a zinc-lead-silver operation located in the north-eastern part of Australias Northern Territory.
It is the third largest zinc deposit in the world and was acquired in 2003 as part of the Mount Isa Mines portfolio.
In October 2006, the Northern Territory government approved an AUD110 million project to convert McArthur River Mine from an underground to an open pit operation which, combined with an expansion of the concentrator, would extend the mines life by an estimated 21 years to 2027.
This project increased McArthur River Mines production volumes from 1.8 million tonnes in 2007 to 2.5 million tonnes per annum in 2010.
Xstrata Zinc is currently investigating an integrated development plan involving its European and Canadian smelters to increase production capacity at McArthur River Mine to around 5 million tonnes per annum by 2014.
The $900 million plan aims to secure the long-term future of the operation in the face of a decline in the traditional international markets for the bulk zinc-lead concentrate produced by the mine.
Over 90% of zinc produced globally is produced by electrolytic smelters which cannot use bulk concentrate, such as that produced at McArthur River Mine.
McArthur River Mine The project will involve the installation of proprietary hydrometallurgy technology is a zinc-lead-silver that can consume McArthur River Mines bulk concentrate at Xstrata Zincs operation located in the San Juan fide Nieva smelter in Spain and the Nordenham smelter in Germany, as north-east of Australias well as potential further improvements in the Brunswick lead smelter in Canada.

ATCOM East is located in ATCOM East thermal coal: the Witbank area in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa.
In October 2009, Xstratas Board approved Xstrata Coals ATCOM East project in South Africa, with a capital commitment of around $407 million.
ATCOM East was formerly part of the Douglas Tavistock joint venture between Xstrata Coal South Africa 16% and BHP Billiton 84%.
In March 2008, the restructuring of the Douglas Tavistock joint venture was announced and Xstrata took full ownership of its share of reserves and mobile equipment in December 2009.
The restructuring has enabled Xstrata to integrate its share of the reserves million tonnes into its Impunzi complex and leverage existing infrastructure.
4 The ATCOM East project has involved the purchasing of mining equipment, per annum of thermal coal upgrading the existing coal handling and processing plant and constructing achieved by 2011 new infrastructure to handle the additional tonnage.
Construction began during the third quarter of 2009 at a site close to both ATCOM Easts and ATCOMs mining areas, which will enable a reduction in transport distances and improve efficiencies.
The construction phase of the project has resulted in 900 new jobs and a further 263 permanent jobs over the next 25 years once full production is reached.
Xstrata Coal is transitioning its South African operations into three large-scale, lower-cost, primarily open cut mine complexes focused around the Impunzi, Goedgevonden and Tweefontein operations.
The project was 75% complete at the end of December 2010 and will produce an average of 3.15 million tonnes per annum of thermal coal for domestic and export markets during its 26 year life.

George Fisher mine expansion zinc: Drilling at Xstrata Zincs George Fisher mine, Queensland, Australia.
In September 2010, approval was received for the AUD274 million expansion of the underground George Fisher mine which will increase the production rate by 29% from 2013.
The annual production capacity will increase from 3.5 million tonnes per annum to 4.5 million tonnes per annum and will create jobs for an additional 250 contractors in its construction and 120 employees in its operation.
The expansion, along with the AUD130 million Black Star Deeps open cut development, will ensure the full utilisation of the zinc-lead concentrator capacity in Mount Isa, which was increased to 8 million tonnes per annum in 2009.
The project involves the development of a second hoisting shaft and associated infrastructure to service the northern area of the mine using large-diameter raise boring technology.
It will also include the installation of an underground crushing and ore handling facility and upgrades to power and air ventilation services.
