Case Study Digital Switchover Help Scheme Broadcaster launches digital campaign in Scotland.
Broadcaster and former Tomorrows World Presenter, Maggie Philbin, recently joined forces with the Digital Switchover Help Scheme team to officially launch the Helping Hand campaign.
Maggie, who is an ambassador for the Digital Switchover Help Scheme, made a visit to Longforgan Parish Church in Perth to talk to members of a luncheon group about how to make the change to digital.
She said: Many people will find it simple to switch and lots of people already have.
But we understand that some people may struggle with what they need to do, especially if they are older, or if they have a disability.
For those who need a little extra help, we want them to know that they will get the additional support they need from the Digital Switchover Help Scheme.
