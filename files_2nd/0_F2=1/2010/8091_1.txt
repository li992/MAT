Digital Excellence As the world moves ever more towards digital and multi-platform delivery, our companies continue to develop more of our products and services to be available electronically.
Digital marketing, social media and online services bring us closer to our key audiences and present opportunities to produce more targeted, richer and relevant information.
Our engagement and delivery in these platforms increases customer loyalty, retention and price leverage.
In 2010 we continued to develop and expand our high quality content with nearly three quarters of our publishing revenues coming from digital activity.
A good example of this is the new Lloyds List Intelligence tracking service which uses satellite and land based receivers to monitor movement, a far cry from the days when Edward Lloyd pinned his list on the wall of his coff ee shop back in 1734.
Print-on-demand and online partnerships not only greatly enhance the effi ciency of the fulfi llment and distribution but also reduce our carbon footprint and move us towards a more sustainable business.
