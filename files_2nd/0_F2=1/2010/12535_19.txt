Premier was awarded two licences in January 2011, one operated, in response to two applications made in the Norwegian 2010 APA Licence Round.
The non-operated licence is an extension of the PL378 licence.

Logging results showed high water saturation and the well was plugged and abandoned.
Testing of the K-19 step-out well in the Kadanwari area was carried out in January and tied in to the system in March 2010.
This well is currently producing around 40 mmscfd and has helped in substantially boosting field production during the year.

The decision was taken to side-track the well, which targets the reservoir area outside of the K-25 drilled compartment.
The K18-ST exploration well tested gas at a flow rate of 18 mmscfd with a 42 64 choke at 1,980psi wellhead pressure.
Tie-in operations of the K18-ST well have commenced, with gas expected on-stream in the first quarter of 2011.
