Business review Babcock International Group PLC 31 Operational r Operational review continued eview continued Whilst initial volumes have been slow, we anticipate there will be a considerable increase in volume going forward.
Funding has recently been withdrawn from the sludge encapsulation project as Sellafield continues to refine its programme of works.
However, we were well advanced with testing and trials using bespoke equipment developed at our Irlam site.
We are confident that the innovative solution we have developed and successfully tested can be successfully deployed to deal with waste materials both at Sellafield and other UK sites in the future.
Outlook The closure of most of the UKs nuclear power stations by 2017 has helped create a huge demand for the building of new power generating stations.
In addition, there are plans being developed to extend the generating life of a small number of existing facilities.
We have extensive knowledge and experience of these plants, and are well positioned to benefit from any future investment both in support for continued operations and life extensions and in new build.
Although the decommissioning market will continue to face some uncertainty as government spending priorities are reviewed, we believe there are opportunities to assist the NDA in reducing expenditure through the outsourcing of more site activities.
We remain confident in the growth prospects for the division, both in the UK and overseas, and believe our track record and scale and depth of our resource will place us in a strong position from which to benefit.
