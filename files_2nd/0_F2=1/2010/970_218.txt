6 Mtpa groUp strategy aCtions Investing in world class assets in the most attractive commodities Thermal Coal has a diverse, high quality, low cost asset base that underpins its current focus to expand in the booming Asian energy market.
This is being supplemented by an extensive portfolio of expansion projects, supported by targeted acquisitions.
Organising efficiently and effectively Given changing domestic and seaborne markets, logistics constraints and maturity of its assets, Thermal Coal maximises its use of available export capacity and delivers optimal value from its portfolio.
This includes value driven asset optimisation and prioritisation, the alignment of its portfolio with its strategic objectives and development of highest margin products.
To this end, Thermal Coal has announced that it intends disposing of its Kleinkopje Colliery and in February 2011 commenced a formal sale process for the asset.
Operating safely, sustainably and responsibly Thermal Coal reported an outstanding safety performance, with its first ever fatality free calendar year, and LTIFR improving 27% versus 2009.
Employing the best people Diversity amongst our employees is foremost on the agenda women represent 17% of the workforce and plans are in place to grow that proportion.
