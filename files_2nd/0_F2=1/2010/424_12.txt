We have Analysis of the log and test data acquired 30 been able to deploy the subsurface knowledge from the Okwok-9 well, and together with the 31 gained from work on the Ebok field to identify seismic data, indicates that the primary objective 32 Okwok as a high-potential opportunity.

obtained from the well is consistent with, and 37 supports, our subsurface model for the field.
38 The results suggest that well productivity 39 under a development completion scenario 40 from a horizontal well would be consistent 41 with production rates typically expected in the 42 area of between 2,000 bopd to 4,000 bopd 43 perwell.
44 45 Work is now focused on defining the next steps 46 in the ongoing evaluation of the field, and in 47 particular working up conceptual development 48 solutions that may include standalone options 49 and also development as a satellite to the 50 nearby Ebok field.
51 52 2011 outlook 53 Having established the field as a commercial 54 development project, with NSAI ascribing 55 51.8 mmbbls of gross recoverable resources 56 to the field, we are now focusing efforts on 57 defining the precise requirements and optimal 58 development concepts that could be utilised.
59 These include development as a satellite tie 60 back to the central Ebok MOPU and FSO, or 61 alternatively installation of a separate dedicated 62 production processing facility with shared usage 63 of the Ebok FSO.
In order to assist with this 64 process we plan to drill an additional appraisal 65 well at the field in 2011 and acquire new 3D 66 seismic over the area.

Exposure to west Africas prolific Upper Cretaceous systems CI-01 has a proven petroleum system in multiple reservoirs within the Cretaceous.
Oiland gas has been found and tested in the Ibex and Kudu fields, while only gas has been found in the Eland field.
Most of the oil and gas encountered is in reservoirs that are younger than the Albian structural closures originally targeted in the past.
There are 3D seismic surveys covering Ibex, Kudu and Eland, and a2D seismic grid covers the rest of the block.
The block borders the maritime boundary with Below: Routine site inspection at the Lion Gas Plant.
Ghana, and lies adjacent to the major Jubilee and Tweneboa oil and gas discoveries that have been made in recent years.
We have applied the latest understanding of the Cretaceous depositional systems to the existing well and seismic dataset to redefine the distribution of oil and gas in Kudu and Ibex, as well as other accumulations on the block.
Consequently, webelieve that the discoveries made to date onthe block have the potential to be significantly larger than originally mapped.
2011 outlook We have completed a detailed subsurface evaluation and defined multiple prospects and leads in order to establish the optimal location for a well to test the new Cretaceous interpretation.
Contingent on resolution of the political situation and EU sanctions regime we aim to acquire more 3D seismic over the block and may consider other techniques such as electromagnetic surveying that could aid our understanding of these complex depositionalsystems.
