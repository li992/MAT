powder power - a CoMponent journey valve BoDy Following material selection, bodycotes valve components operating in the harsh design engineers will work closely with environments of the oil & gas and chemical the valve body begins customers to explore the unique and flexible industries must withstand extreme material life as high quality gas component design opportunities afforded by demands and resist attack from a variety of atomised stainless steel pM Hip nns.
when the final nns component aggressive environments.
the use of powder and nickel-based powders design is received from the customer, metal Hiped near net shape pM Hip nns bodycote will create an engineering drawing components offers optimised material solutions for enhanced product strength and durability.
the encapsulated pM valve is then Hiped using high temperatures and pressures which allows the powder to become after Hip the nns component 100% dense and form is solution heat treated and an nns component water quenched to achieve optimum material properties which are isotropic in nature Component design is then translated into a capsule the fabricated capsule, almost design where skilled engineers identical in shape to the manufacture the canister and use finished component but larger welding techniques to produce in size, is filled with powder the complex capsule assembly Finally the component can be pickled or machined to remove the capsule material resulting in a pM Hip nns valve body which is inspected using ultrasonic testing techniques the Hiped and heat treated nns shape valve body is laser scanned to compare the dimensions of the actual component with the nns product drawing BoDyCote Component Journeys this is just one example of how bodycote brings together the huge wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the Group to provide the vital engineering services our customers need...
