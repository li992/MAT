2 The figure represents the contributions paid over the year.
3 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 March 2010 and the corresponding accrued pension at the beginning of the year.
No allowance is made for inflation.
4 As note 3, except that the figure quoted includes an adjustment for inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
5 The figure shown represents the transfer value of the inflation-adjusted increase in the total accrued pension for the year, net of the directors own contributions.
6 The figure shown represents the transfer value of the accumulated total accrued pension as at the beginning of the year.
7 The figure shown represents the transfer value of the accumulated total accrued pension at 31 March 2010.
During the course of the year the actuarial basis used by the Group Scheme was amended by the Trustees, generally resulting in an increase in the transfer value amount.
The transfer value quoted has been calculated using the actuarial bases which applied at 31 March 2010.
Part of the increase in the transfer value over the year is attributable to the change in actuarial basis.
During the year, discretionary early retirement terms which allowed executives to retire at age 60 on an unreduced pension were removed.
The transfer value quoted reflects Tim Lodges normal retirement age of 62.
This change had the effect of reducing the transfer value relative to that quoted at 31 March 2009.
8 The figure shown represents the increase in the transfer value from the beginning of the year to 31 March 2010.
The transfer value quoted has been calculated using the actuarial bases which applied at each reporting date, net of the directors own contributions.
Stuart Strathdee, a member of the Group pension scheme and a former director who stepped down from the Board on 23 July 2008, continued as an employee until he left the company on 31 July 2009.
During the year Stuart Strathdee opted out of the Group pension scheme and his full accrued pension entitlement was paid as a cash equivalent transfer value to a private pension arrangement.
