The majority of the portfolio is now valued at nil with a remaining portfolio carrying value of approximately 128 million.
Fair value unwind decreased 3,767 million to 3,130 million, mainly due to lower impairments in 2010 relating to the HBOS assets that were fair valued on acquisition.
The decrease was partially offset by charges relating to the expected losses on acquired debt securities and by fair value releases on sales.
Balance sheet progress The divisions asset balances comprising loans and advances to customers and banks, debt securities and available-for-sale financial assets reduced by 38.4 billion, or 14 per cent to 240.9 billion, primarily reflecting deleveraging by customers and continuing active fide-risking of the balance sheet by either selling down or reducing holdings in debt securities and available-for-sale positions.
Loans and advances to customers decreased 18.6 billion, or 10 per cent to 173.2 billion.
In Corporate Markets, balances decreased by 17.5 billion or 10 per cent, as demand for new corporate lending and refinancing of existing facilities were more than offset by the level of maturities, reflecting a continued trend of subdued corporate lending, customer deleveraging and asset sales in non-core sectors.
Despite this overall reduction, net lending to core customers in the SME sector increased by 2.1 per cent.
In Asset Finance, the decrease of 2.7 billion, or 23 per cent, reflected the targeted reduction in this asset class.
Available for sale financial assets balances reduced by 7.4 billion, or 20 per cent, to 29.5 billion and debt securities decreased by 5.9 billion, or 19 per cent, to 25.8 billion, as Corporate Markets reduced the non-core balance sheet by either selling down or not replenishing total holdings after amortisations or maturities.
Loans and advances to banks decreased 6.5 billion, or 34 per cent as the division refocused the balance sheet.
Customer deposits excluding repos decreased by 3.8 billion, or 3 per cent to 114.1 billion, due to a reduction in short-term deposits in Treasury and Trading, which was partially offset by higher deposits in Corporate Markets in line with Groups funding strategy.

This reflected lower interest earning asset balances as a result of the ongoing focus on reducing the balance sheet.
Despite increased funding costs net interest income benefited from improved margins from customer re-pricing.

Additionally other income benefited from investment gains in Wholesale Equity as a result of stabilising market conditions, and strong fee income across structuring and capital markets.
Operating expenses decreased by 51 million to 2,410 million due to continued synergy benefits, partially offset by investment in the Business Support Unit as well as customer facing resource and systems.

The lower business volumes are in-line with a targeted reduction in this asset class and were partly offset by stronger margins.
Operating expenses decreased by 342 million, or 23 per cent, to 1,116 million, reflecting reduced depreciation charges on assets held under operating leases due to lower fleet size and a year on year improvement in used car values, and strong cost management and savings achieved from integration.
The impairment charge decreased by 564 million to 264 million, reflecting a stabilising economic environment and an improvement in market conditions for both the retail and non-retail consumer finance businesses.
The lower impairment charge has been driven by a reduction in new cases entering arrears, the reduced book size and a better mix in the credit quality of new business being written over the last two years.

Total income decreased by 1,390 million to 425 million primarily due to a 1,045 million reduction in liability management gains, together with a 193 million increase in the mark-to-market losses arising from the equity conversion feature of the Groups Enhanced Capital Notes and a 131 million reduction in the gain on other derivatives which cannot be mitigated through hedge accounting.
Liability management gains arose on transactions undertaken in both 2009 and 2010 as part of the Groups management of capital which exchanged certain debt securities for ordinary shares or other debt instruments.
These transactions resulted in a gain of 423 million in 2010 compared to a gain of 1,498 million in 2009 of which 1,468 million is reflected in Central items.
The fair value of the equity conversion feature of the Groups Enhanced Capital Notes decreased by 620 million in 2010 compared to a decrease of 427 million in 2009.
Net interest expense was broadly unchanged at 823 million, but included higher capital and wholesale liquidity funding costs of 601 million 2009: 260 million not recovered from the divisions, with the increase primarily due to higher wholesale market funding spreads and the Groups decision to accelerate its wholesale funding in 2010.
This has been offset by improved net interest from interest rate risk management activities compared to 2009.
Operating expenses reduced by 187 million to 107 million due to lower professional fees and other costs associated with capital transactions and projects.
Fair value unwind improved by 673 million to 1,446 million primarily due to the effect of the liability management transactions leading to a reduced amortisation rate.
Gains on liability management transactions included accelerated fair value amortisations.
