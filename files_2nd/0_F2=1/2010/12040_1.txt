Overview KPIs Strategy Operations and Finance Responsibility Governance Financial Statements Company Information Introduction Persimmon is a leading UK housebuilder operating from 25 regional offices.
Macroeconomic conditions remain challenging and we anticipate the marketplace remaining constrained for the next two to three years, principally due to mortgage availability.
However, customers continue to visit our sites across the whole country in good numbers demonstrating that underlying demand for new homes remains resilient.
Our robust balance sheet places us in a very strong position to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace that will help our profitable growth.
We remain confident in the future prospects of the housing market in the long term.
