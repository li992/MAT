RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 INVESTMENT REVIEW 8 INVESTMENT RECLASSIFICATION During the year, the basis of classification of investments within the portfolio was changed to reflect more accurately the investment approach and the underlying characteristics of the investments.
Three new categories have been introduced: Real assets, Absolute return, fixed income and currency and Liquidity.
The main constituents of these new categories, as well as a reconciliation of the prior year disclosures, are set out below.
Real assets This new category includes investments expected to benefit from an inflationary environment, such as commodities and real estate.
The commodity exposure includes direct exposure to commodities as well as investments by way of equities or funds in the gold, metals and mining, energy and soft commodities sectors.
The real estate category includes the Groups investment properties as well as real estate funds such as Xander our Indian real estate investment.
Absolute return, fixed income and currency The absolute return category includes investment strategies which are expected over time to display modest correlation to public markets.
It includes any investments in hedge funds targeting absolute return strategies as well as credit and distressed debt funds.
The fixed income category includes any corporate debt investments, as well as government securities with a duration of more than two years and related derivatives.
The currency category includes the Groups currency forwards and options, which are used to modify the underlying currency disposition resulting from the Groups non-Sterling denominated investments.
Liquidity This category includes short-dated government securities, money market funds and cash balances.
The opening balances at 31 March 2009 under the new asset categories can be reconciled to the closing balances as shown below.
