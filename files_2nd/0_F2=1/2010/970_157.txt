Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information 61 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 jwanengs sUperpit Work is already under way to extend the life of Jwaneng, the worlds richest diamond mine.
At Jwaneng, the existing mining operation is expected to have depleted ore by 2017, at which time the mine would have effectively closed down.
In 2009, however, Debswanas shareholders agreed to fund a stay-in-business $3billion project, named Cut-8, to extend the mines life to at least 2025.
The extension is a huge undertaking as the amount of overburden to be removed to expose the same quantity of diamonds as is being mined at present is almost three times the current 40 million tonnes per annum.
During this operation, which is due to take six years until 2016, around 658 million tonnes of waste material will be removed with the open pit almost doubling in depth from 330 metres to 624metres.
By 2017, approximately 91 million tonnes of ore will be available for processing, and the mine will be able to maintain a minimum flow of 10 million tonnes of ore a year through its treatment plant.
During its seven-year extended life, this is expected to yield a further 100 million carats of mainly high quality diamonds.
Cut-8 represents the largest single investment in Botswanas mining industry, boosting the countrys standing as one of the most successful African states in transforming its natural resource endowment into a more prosperous and sustainable future for all of its people.
