Directors Remuneration Report continued Whilst each element could be measured separately, failure to exceed the profit level achieved in 2009 would have resulted in no bonus being earned for either the profit or sales elements in 2010.
Against the 2010 annual bonus targets a payment of 56.6% of annual salary has been earned by Kennedy McMeikan, 56.6% by Richard Hutton and 56.6% by Raymond Reynolds.
For 2011 the maximum target bonus levels will continue to be established on the basis above, which the Remuneration Committee consider to be suitably challenging.
Whilst each element can be measured separately, failure to exceed the profit level achieved in 2010 will result in no bonus being earned for either the profit or sales elements in 2011.
The Committee have also introduced a claw-back clause in the Bonus Scheme rules as follows: The Committee reserve the right to claw-back any portion of the bonus payment that has been paid in error should it come to light, at a future date, that there was a material misstatement of the operating profit resulting in a significant over-payment.
 Performance Share Plan Shareholder approval was obtained in 2009 for the introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP from 2010.
The introduction of the Performance Share Plan in 2010 under which an award of shares was made in line with the level awarded under the previous Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, restricted for three years and vesting in full or part subject to the achievement of a combination of EPS growth and TSR targets, is intended to provide a greater focus on achieving key long-term business goals and increased shareholder value.
The awards under the PSP made in 2010 have the following targets set: EPS TSR Annualcompound Proportionof Positionrelative Proportionof growth awardvesting tocomparator awardvesting %opportunity groupofFTSE250 %opportunity FoodProducers, Retailers&Leisure Companies Less than RPI 3% Nil Below median Nil Threshold RPI 3% 12.5% At median 12.5% Maximum RPI 8% 50% Upper quartile 50% 74
