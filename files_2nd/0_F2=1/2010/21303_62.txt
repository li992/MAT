They exclude other financial assets, mainly equity securities held in the trading portfolio or as available for sale assets, as well as non-financial assets.
The nominal value of off-balance sheet credit related instruments is also shown, where appropriate.
Financial assets designated at fair value in respect of linked liabilities to customers under investment contracts have not been included as the Group is not exposed to credit risk on these assets.
Credit losses in these portfolios, if any, would lead to a reduction in the linked liabilities and result in no direct loss to the Group.
