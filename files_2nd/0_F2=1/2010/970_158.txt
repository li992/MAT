30 years groUp strategy aCtions Investing in world class assets in the most attractive commodities Our Los Bronces expansion is on track to deliver first production in the final quarter of 2011, raising our total attributable copper output to over 900 ktpa by 2012, while substantial increases to our reserves and resources base have recently been announced.
Organising efficiently and effectively Our asset optimisation and procurement initiatives continued to deliver significant benefits during a year in which unit operating costs were impacted adversely by a range of climbing input costs and an appreciating Chilean currency.
Operating safely, sustainably and responsibly Our Chagres smelter excelled in the Chilean mine safety awards, taking second place in the prestigious John T. Ryan award for safety in the workplace.
Employing the best people The development of talent remains a priority and we are working closely with The People Development Way to recruit, retain and develop the skills needed to stay in the forefront of the worlds top copper businesses.
