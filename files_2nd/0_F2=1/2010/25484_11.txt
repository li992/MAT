We now have 95 quoted clients with an average market cap of 320 million, of which 29 are FTSE 250 companies.
Southern Africa We maintained our strong positioning with a similar level of activity to that of the prior year Our main focus was on M&A and restructuring transactions We retained all our major clients and gained several new mandates during the period The total value of Corporate Finance transactions increased to R26.8 billion 2009: R23.4 billion during the period and the number of transactions decreased to 56 2009: 60 Sponsor broker deals completed during the period decreased to 82 2009: 96 with the value also decreasing to R46.7 billion 2009: R51 billion The Corporate Finance division was ranked first in volume of listed M&A transactions and first in general corporate finance by volume in Dealmakers Magazine Survey for Corporate Finance 2009 calendar year.
This is the sixth year out of seven that we have been awarded the M&A Gold Medal.
We were also awarded Dealmaker of the Decade by volume The Sponsor division was ranked first in volume of M&A transactions and second in general corporate finance in the Dealmakers Magazine Survey for Sponsors 2009 calendar year.
This is the seventh year running that we have won this M&A award The Corporate Finance and Sponsor divisions were also both ranked first in volume of M&A transactions in the Ernst & Young review for M&A 2009 calendar year.
Australia Earnings improved during the year due to the successful closing of a number of transactions The Sydney team was strengthened and reorganised and is well positioned to drive the business going forward.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading UK and Europe While volatile markets and difficult market conditions have constrained secondary commission growth, there has been a steady improvement over the last few months We have strengthened our broking business with a number of senior hires in research and sales trading We continue to expand our international distribution capability.
Southern Africa Our equity research activity posted marked gains over the year.
Over 100 South African companies are now being analysed and our research is ranked firmly in the top three among our target client base Our USA distribution hub has been strengthened to ensure greater penetration into this lucrative market The Africa excluding South Africa initiative was launched during the period and good progress has been achieved in creating the foundations for this platform Ongoing progress was made in strengthening our position and improving our market share in both the prime broking and electronic trading activities.
Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 85 Investment Banking continued Australia This is a new business and the team members who have been hired to grow the business have a considerable amount of high quality experience and an extensive client network.
Principal Investments Southern Africa The Direct Investments portfolio decreased to R1 587 million at 31 March 2010 March 2009: R1 816 million.
The decrease in value was 2 primarily due to realisations on listed equities The Private Equity portfolio was R3 301 million at 31 March 2010 March 2009: R2 525 million.
We continued to expand the capacity of our private equity investments through the acquisition of two new private equity assets, two bolt-on acquisitions within the portfolio and large capital projects and expenditure.
The benefits of these activities will only be felt in future financial years.
The increase in value in the current year was driven by a good performance of the underlying investments and acquisitions mentioned.
Australia The total size of the Private Equity funds is A$460 million Private Equity completed the successful divestment of one of its portfolio companies generating a substantial profit The investment portfolio continues to perform satisfactorily and is well placed to capitalise on the recovery in both global and local economies In the second half of the financial year the Private Equity business took a more proactive approach in identifying and evaluating new investment opportunities as the economic outlook and confidence generally continued to improve.
Outlook, risks and opportunities Corporate Finance The increase in the number and size of our corporate clients in the UK has been encouraging.
While market conditions remain uncertain, the pipeline is looking more positive M&A and restructuring transactions are expected to continue to drive activity at a reasonable level in South Africa In Australia M&A and capital markets remain challenging compared with prior years.
We are seeing increased competition in M&A as established banks and new boutiques move into this area of the market.
While the outlook for M&A seems to have improved slightly over the last 12 months, continuing economic uncertainty suggests M&A and capital markets will recover slowly.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading Considering the improvements to our UK business through selective investment in skills, diversified revenue streams and capital provision we believe we are well positioned to gain further market share The quality of our Institutional Securities platform in South Africa has been strengthened over the past 12 months and, as a result, we are well positioned to benefit from an economic upswing.
Key risks to the upside are activity levels on the JSE, ongoing downward pressure on brokerage rates and team stability in an environment characterised by a shortage of talent.
Principal Investments We remain active in seeking direct investment opportunities, while continuing to unlock further value from the portfolio and building black economic empowerment platforms in South Africa The majority of the companies in our Private Equity portfolio in South Africa are trading in line with expectations in very difficult market conditions and the overall outlook remains positive The Australian business continues to add value to existing investments and is well placed to take advantage of new investment opportunities.
The business is very active in originating new investment opportunities as the economic outlook and confidence generally improves.
Two new investments were added in the first quarter of the 2011 financial year and a number of further potential opportunities have been identified and are at various stages of development.
