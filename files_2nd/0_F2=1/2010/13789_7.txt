MMboe on a net unrisked basis targeted by the 2011 Sustaining exploration programme drilling programme with an average chance of success of 30%.
The Group has built one of the largest in-region technical teams of any oil and gas company operating 312 in SE Asia.
This is comprised of individuals who combine regional and international knowledge, the ability to apply the best technology available globally and an in-depth understanding of the geology.
Salamander has an extensive E&A portfolio.
The Group high grades its prospect inventory and is funded to drill 12 to 14 E&A wells a year.
Where possible the Group seeks to farm down higher risk prospects freeing up capital to be redeployed in lower-mid risk activity, whilst retaining material exposure to a successful well result.
In 2011 the Group plans to drill 9 exploration and 4 appraisal wells targeting 312 MMboe of net unrisked resource 95 MMboe on a risked basis.
