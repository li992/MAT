Platinum projects reflect approved capital expenditure.
2 Represents 100% of average incremental or replacement production, at full production, unless otherwise stated.
2 Shaft is currently under review.
4 Debswana will invest $500 million in capital expenditure.
Project investment, including capital expenditure, is likely to total $3 billion over the next 15 years.
Total carats exposed are over the life of the expansion.
5 Pebble will produce molybdenum and gold by-products, Michiquillay will produce molybdenum, gold and silver by-products and other projects will produce molybdenum and silver by-products.
6 The February 2010 earthquake in Chile impacted the rate of progress and ultimate capital cost of the Los Bronces expansion project.
Remedial actions have ensured the project remains on schedule for first production in Q4 2011.
The cost impact remains under review.
7 Production represents average over first 10 years of the project.
Production over the first three years of the project will average 278 ktpa.
8 Capital expenditure, post-acquisition of Anglo Americans shareholding in Minas-Rio, includes 100% of the mine and pipeline, and an attributable share of the port, as modified by the agreement with LLX SA and LLX MinasRio.
9 Further phased expansions have the potential to increase production to 1 Mtpa.
Metallurgical Coal took further steps to focus and the underground operation has four Debswana commenced the $3 billion Cut-8 its business on high margin export products of eight production sections deployed.
The expansion project at Jwaneng mine during by progressing the Grosvenor and Drayton washing plant, which is a 50:50 joint venture 2010.
Cut-8 represents the largest ever mining South feasibility studies.
It is expected that with BHP Billiton Energy Coal South Africa, is investment in Botswana and is expected to a Board approval decision in relation to fully commissioned and is operating at 80% extend the life of mine to at least 2025. the development of the 4.3 Mtpa Grosvenor of planned monthly production.
Completion of metallurgical coal project will be taken in the man and materials shaft is expected to be the second quarter of 2012. in the second quarter of 2011.
The feasibility study for the New Largo project started in 2010 In South Africa, the $517 million Zibulo and is expected to be completed in the first project is approaching completion, the quarter of 2012. opencast operation is at full production
