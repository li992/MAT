Resource triangle It takes consistent target generation to develop a quality portfolio.
The resource triangle is the tool used by Randgold to manage this process.
A series of filters controls the progress of a target to the next level of the development chain or its rejection: The key hurdle for a viable project is 3 million ounces and an internal rate of return of 20%.
The growth in targets during 2010 results from new generative work at Tongon and Kibali and the addition of new permits.
