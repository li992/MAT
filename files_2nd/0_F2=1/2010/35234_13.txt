Performance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 Property review Investment activity We continually review new opportunities to add to our portfolio where we can create value through regeneration and our particular blend of design and project skills.
Acquisitions Acquisitions and disposals A number of opportunities were considered during the year and we made one substantial acquisition, the purchase of Central Cross, 18-30 Tottenham Court Road W1 in August for 146.0m, before costs.
The 251,000 sq ft 23,300m freehold property, let to tenants 146m such as FremantleMedia Group, S Technologies the owner of Skype and Encompass Digital Media, has an annual rental income Central Cross of 8.1m, which reflects a low average rent of 34 per sq ft 365 per m. This prominent West End building comprises 216,000 sq ft 20,100m of offices, 24,000 sq ft 2,200m of retail space fronting onto Tottenham Court Road and an 11,000 sq ft 1,000m cinema.
The property is strategically located in an area where the Group has substantial holdings and where we expect to see significant improvements from infrastructure enhancements, principally 45m Crossrail.
The building offers considerable rental and capital growth 1 Page Street prospects.
As discussed in the Projects section, there is significant scope to reconfigure and extend the property and we are well advanced with our plans.
No other significant acquisitions or disposals were made in the year.
However, since the year end we have exchanged contracts on two separate purchases totalling 76m before costs.
Both were 31m off-market transactions and offer the opportunity to increase value through refurbishment.
Network Building We have exchanged contracts to acquire 1 Page Street SW1 for 45m.
This is a 118,000 sq ft 11,000m vacant office building opposite our very successful Horseferry House project.
We are looking to refurbish the building extensively with completion due in mid-2012, to meet improving tenant demand.
The other acquisition is the Network Building, 95-100 Tottenham Court Road W1, which is located in our Fitzrovia Estate.
The Group already owns the buildings freehold and we have exchanged contracts to acquire the existing headlease for 31m.
The lease runs until 2054 with a fixed nominal ground rent.
The 64,000 sq ft 5,900m multi-let office and retail building produces 2.1m pa and there is 15,200 sq ft 1,400m of vacant offices which require refurbishment.
