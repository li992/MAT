Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 11 Middle East-Pakistan Our Middle East-Pakistan business unit continues to focus on enhancing the value of our Pakistan producing assets by maximising production through exploration and development within the existing fields.
We are seeking to extend our presence to new areas in the Middle East through new exploration and by evaluating acquisition opportunities.
Pakistan Average production was 14,900 boepd 2009: 15,720 boepd.
This was mainly attributed to natural depletion of our gas fields and to some interruptions at the Zamzama field caused by the significant flooding suffered in August 2010.
Looking forward, production will be boosted by implementing ongoing front end compression projects, full utilisation of all production facilities, and increased production from the successful exploration and development wells drilled at the Kadanwari field during 2010.
The Qadirpur gas field average production in 2010 was 3,550 boepd 2009: 4,150 boepd.
The decrease in 2010 production of 14 per cent was due to natural decline in reservoir pressure.
However, after the completion of the installation of front end compressors in October 2010, gas production has been increased from around 480 million standard cubic feet per day mmscfd to 600 mmscfd gross and this level is expected to be maintained with the installation of additional compressors by the end of 2011.
Two production wells QP-40 and QP-41 were drilled and tied in during the year.
Supply of 60 mmscfd permeate gas a side stream of low heating value gas from process facilities to local power plants commenced in February 2010 as planned, with the added benefit of simultaneously reducing gas flaring venting from the facilities.
The Kadanwari gas field average production in 2010 was 1,750 boepd 2009: 1,250 boepd.
This increase of 40 per cent was achieved by the drilling and tie-in of two development wells, K-21 and K-23, and two successful exploration wells, K-19 and K-24.
Further development and exploration wells are planned for 2011 to maintain production.
The Zamzama gas field average production in 2010 was 6,050 boepd 2009: 6,890 boepd.
The lower production was due to natural decline in reservoir pressure, as well as two production wells having to be shut in from September through December 2010 due to the exceptional floods in the area.
In order to mitigate natural decline, the major front end compression project gross capex of US$145 million is making good progress and is scheduled for completion in June 2011.
The Bhit Badhra gas fields average production in 2010 was 3,550 boepd 2009: 3,430 boepd.
The wellhead compression project, which commenced in 2009, remained on schedule and by the end of 2010 all wells in Bhit were connected to compression.
Field development at Zarghun South was delayed following higher than expected facilities bids.
The joint venture now awaits the passing of the impending Tight Gas Policy presently under approval process by the government to take advantage of higher gas prices.
All costs pertaining to Premiers 3.75 per cent interest are carried by the operator.
