2 3 EKATI Core Zone Diamond resources are estimated on an effective 1mm square aperture stone size cut-off.
Changes in proposed mining method have resulted in movement of some resource from underground to open-cut.
4 EKATI Buffer Zone Diamond resources are estimated on an effective 1mm square aperture stone size cut-off.
5 Richards Bay Minerals As the result of a Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment transaction, BHP Billiton now hold a 37% interest.
Rio Tinto has responsibility for the management of the operation.
Mineral Resources are reported as at 31 December 2009.

K O potassium oxide, MgO magnesium oxide.
%MgO is generally used 2 as a measure of carnallite KCl.
6H O content where per cent carnallite equivalent %MgO x 6.8918.
However, in the above statement the 2 2 main source of the stated MgO content is the dolomite fraction of the insoluble material.
Areas of known geological anomalies, carnallitite which comprises carnallite, halite and minor associated insolubles and privately owned mineral tenure have been removed from the estimate.
It is expected that a further 5% to 10% of the Mineral Resource tonnage will be discounted due to, as yet, unidentified geological anomalies.
The Mineral Resource is stated for the Lower Patience Lake potash unit.
A stratigraphic cut-off based on the top 406 clay seam and base 402 clay seam has been applied.
A cut-off grade of 15% K O was applied to the Resource Estimate, no further modifying or mining extraction factors have been applied to the 2 Mineral Resource.
