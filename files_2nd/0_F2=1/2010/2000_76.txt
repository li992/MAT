There will be straight line bonus vesting between points.
The matrix demonstrates the dynamic tension between the two performance conditions.
One cannot be met at the expense of the other.
If the minimum threshold levels for either are not met, no contribution is made to the New Bonus Plan account.
If the minimum threshold levels of performance are not met for both performance conditions, 50% of the participants plan account will be forfeited.
Structuring the performance conditions in this way will ensure consistent levels of ROE at the same time as the Group invests and adds value to the land bank.
ROE is defined as profit before tax divided by average shareholders funds.
Land Bank Growth is defined as the annual percentage increase in the development margin in the land bank.
This is the anticipated future gross margin to be earned from plots controlled and included in the Groups land bank.
To be included in the land bank, management must have reasonable certainty that the plots will come forward for development, either benefiting from a planning consent or being on land zoned for development.
For the avoidance of doubt, the land bank excludes plots subject to strategic land options.
Calculated plot by plot, the development margin is measured on a consistent basis according to prevailing sales prices for revenue, historic cost for costs already incurred and prevailing prices for costs still to be incurred.
It is separately disclosed within the annual report and the presentations to analysts.
Each year the land bank gross margin is reduced naturally by the amount of gross margin sold in the year.
Therefore, zero % growth in the land bank means that replacement matches usage.
Divisional PBT performance condition The Divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the financial year at a level which is challenging taking into account the potential level of bonus payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues.
