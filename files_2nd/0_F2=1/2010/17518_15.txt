| 72 Performance Copper continued Markets Macroeconomic sentiment generated considerable volatility in the copper market during 2010, but strong investor appetite for commodities, coupled with robust copper market fundamentals, supported a copper price rally to a high of $4.41 per pound at year end.
LME cash prices averaged $3.42 per pound over the year, 46% or 107 per pound higher than in 2009.
Strong refined copper demand growth of 10% and weak refined supply growth of just over 3% led to a steady decline in global exchange stocks throughout the year.

Global copper demand grew rapidly during 2010 on the back of a rebound in economic growth.
China continued to lead global copper demand growth as stimulus measures first introduced by the government in 2009 continued throughout the year, driving strong end-use demand for copper.

Lower copper and gold sales volumes reduced operating profit by $77 million as a result of shipments being postponed into 2011.
Mined copper production of 913,500 tonnes was slightly higher than the previous year mainly due to strong performances at Kidd and Ernest Henry mines that offset challenging operating conditions at some South American operations.
