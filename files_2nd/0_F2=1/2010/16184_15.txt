Summer trading was not strong enough to offset increased losses in the Winter season.
Winter losses increased largely due to planned capacity reductions which, whilst ensuring that supply and demand were in balance, removed holidays from the programme that had previously made a positive contribution.
The Summer trading performance was affected by a slowdown in bookings following a downturn in consumer confidence in the early Summer.
Consumer booking trends were affected by the recurrence of airspace closures caused by the volcanic ash, the emergency budget and subsequent austerity measures, and the better than average UK weather, combined with the expected quiet trading period during the World Cup.
The slowdown resulted in more stock left to sell in the lates period than expected and although this period traded well, margins were inevitably affected by this shift to later booking patterns.
