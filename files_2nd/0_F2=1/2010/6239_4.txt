ANd kPIs mitment to disciplined and sustainable growth.
The four components of our strategy are outlined Our goal is to consolidate and maintain the Groups herein, along with the key performance indicators that position as the worlds leading producer of silver monitor the effectiveness of each strategy over time.
1 Maximise the potential of existing operations How we do it By aiming to run operations at full capacity, replacing reserves, generating continuous improvements in productivity and cost controls, utilising technology and leveraging expansion opportunities.
2010 progress OPERATE Record silver and gold production.
Successful implementation of Six Sigma, a statistics-driven methodology for improving operational performance by eliminating variability and waste, resulted in improved recovery rates and or increased milling capacity at all operating mines.
2011 priorities Conclude construction of the San Carlos shaft at Fresnillo to reduce haulage costs Evaluate a future expansion at Fresnillo to compensate for the expected lower ore grades in order to maintain stable silver production Commission the shaft at Cinega to gain access to deeper ore reserves Complete expansion of milling capacity from 755,000 to 930,000 tonnes per year at Cinega to maintain stable gold production Expansion to produce 130,000 total ounces of gold per year at Soledad-Dipolos Key performANce iNdicAtorS Attributable production Sum of ounces produced multiplied by ownership interest at each mine.
Monitors total production levels at our mines and contributions from advance development projects.
Comment Increased ore volumes milled at Fresnillo and silver extracted from development works at Saucito 08 09 10 08 09 10 resulted in record silver production.
Record gold SIlvER GOlD production was achieved mainly due to the startmillions of ounces thousands of ounces up of Soledad-Dipolos, and to a lesser extent, to the good performances at Herradura and Cinega.

Figures for 2008 and 2009 were adjusted 08 09 10 using the same ratio for comparative purposes.
EQUIvAlENT SIlvER OUNCES PER PERSON thousands of ounces Comment Equivalent ounces of silver decreased slightly, by 1.3%, due to new employees hired and trained at Herradura, some of whom were sent to SoledadDipolos and others who will be transferred to Noche Buena.
These non-operating trainees shadow current employees for the first few months of their employment.
Cost per tonne 5 Adjusted production costs total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects divided by total volume of tonnes milled or deposited at the leaching pads.
Monitors variations of costs directly related to the production process: the analysis of such variations improves managements decision-making.

At Herradura, the increase in volume deposited offset the increase in those costs.

2010 progress Successful start-up in January 2010 of commercial production at Soledad-Dipolos, with dEVELOP first year production that exceeded full capacity estimates.
Construction of Saucito advanced ahead of schedule and below budget.

This ensures an exploration pipeline of organic growth projects.
We also pursue early stage joint ventures and make selective acquisitions in Mexico EXPLORE and potentially elsewhere in latin America.
2010 progress Replenished reserves and generated a double-digit increase in gold and silver resources.
Concluded pre-feasibility study at Noche Buena.
Conducted underground development at Saucito, Juanicipio and San Julin.
Completed scoping studies at San Julin and Orisyvo.
Conducted early stage drilling at 11 exploration prospects and continued regional exploration efforts to identify new prospects with high potential.

STRATEGIC RESOURCES 2010 progress While the accident rate decreased due to ongoing safety training and management efforts, two fatal accidents prevented us from maintaining our Zero Fatalities target.
Strict action plans were taken to prevent further fatal accidents.
Unit consumption of water and energy declined.
ISO 14001:2004 and Clean Industry certifications from PROFEPA Mexican Federal Environmental Protection Agency were maintained at all mine units.
Cyanide certification audit process was completed at Herradura and continued at Cinega.
2011 priorities Zero fatalities and continued improvements in other safety indicators Obtain OHSAS 18001:2008 certification at Fresnillo and 50% advance in remaining mines Complete Cyanide Code certification process at Cinega, become a signatory at Soledad-Dipolos Obtain first level of the Safe Enterprise Certificate from STPS Secretariat of labour and Social Welfare at Fresnillo, Herradura and Cinega, and integrate Soledad-Dipolos into the programme GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 17 Key performANce iNdicAtorS A wide range of indicators is used to measure sustainability performance.

Fatalities loss of life of any of the Groups employees full or part-time, direct or subcontracted, union or non-union during any work related activities.
Comment After two years with no fatalities, we suffered two fatal accidents in 2010: in August, a carbon monoxide poisoning at Cinega: in November a 08 09 10 scoop tram accident at Fresnillo.
FATAlITIES Lost work days rate Total number of days lost due to disabling and nondisabling accidents divided by the total number of union and non-union employees and contractors.
Comment While certain safety indicators such as the accident rate decreased, the increase in lost work days mainly reflects the two fatal accidents in the year.
