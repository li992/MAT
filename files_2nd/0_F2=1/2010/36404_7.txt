Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2010 20 Our business Investment management Our analysis of the central London property investment market led us to focus on acquisition opportunities using the Groups financial resources which were bolstered by last summers Rights Issue.
Around 161 million or 97% of the capital raised in our Rights Issue has been committed in five transactions and these assets have all shown healthy increases in value since acquisition.
97% Whilst our investment pipeline is good, we expect it to improve further in the second half of 2010 as the industry wide deleveraging process gathers pace.
Although Londons investment markets capital raised in our Rights are very competitive, we believe the combination of our local knowledge, deep relationships and Issue has been committed structuring skills will help us to originate and execute further attractive acquisitions.
Making acquisitions via joint ventures has been highly successful for us over many years and the balance of our holdings is illustrated below.

The previous leases were for an average term of 69 years and GCP paid an average annual ground rent of 15% of rental value to The Crown Estate.
Under the new leases the annual ground rent payable is reduced to 10%.
Together, the five buildings form a single block fronting Piccadilly and Jermyn Street and currently comprise 132,400 sq ft.
Importantly, the new headleases provide the ability for GCP to carry out a comprehensive redevelopment in due course.
In late September we exchanged contracts to purchase 90 Queen Street, EC4 for 45.8 million.
This prime office and retail building was built in 1996 and comprises 68,400 sq ft of lettable space.
The office accommodation is the UK headquarters of Intesa Sanpaulo SPA and is occupied under a lease until 2017 with a tenant option to break in 2013.
The retail units are occupied by Lloyds Banking Group, Pret A Manger and Hugo Boss.
The rental income of 3.9 million per annum will add approximately one pence per share to Group earnings and equates to a net initial yield, having taken into account all acquisition costs, of 8.2%.
At a capital value per sq ft for the office component of 565, we believe we acquired land and a high quality building at beneath replacement cost, without the development risk, giving us an attractive income return and a variety of asset management opportunities.
In November, we announced the acquisition of two West End development properties and the formation of a profit share and debt structuring arrangement acquiring Marcol House, Marcol House 289 295 Regent Street and 23 24 Newman Street, W1 from Istithmar World PJSC for case study P8O 10.0 million.
Marcol House is a Grade II listed, office and retail development site with planning consent for 102,500 sq ft, located on the corner of Regent Street and Margaret Street, W1,150 yards to the north of Oxford Circus.
Newman Street is an existing office building of 25,200 sq ft with planning consent to provide the residential requirements for the Marcol House site.
Simultaneously with the acquisition, GPE agreed with the debt provider to the assets, Eurohypo, a restructuring of the previous debt facility on Marcol House in exchange for a profit share arrangement in the developments.
Under this arrangement, GPE will develop the two properties, which on acquisition was estimated to cost a total of 78.1 million.
Annual review Governance Financials 21 In December, The Great Ropemaker Partnership GRP acquired the long leasehold interest of Activity map P1O 103 113 Regent Street, W1 for 27.0 million our share 13.5 million reflecting a net initial yield of 7.2%.
The property extends to 52,800 sq ft and is let in its entirety to Austin Reed until 2027 paying 2.45 million per annum 2.1 million after deduction of headrent.
Also in December, GCP acquired the long leasehold interest of Kingsland House, 122 124 Regent Street, W1 for 8.0 million our share 4.0 million reflecting a net initial yield of 5.0% with three vacant office suites.
The property extends to 8,800 sq ft, produces rental income of 0.5 million per annum 0.4 million after the deduction of headrent and is multi-let to seven tenants with expiries between 2010 and 2027.
Both buildings are owned on long leases from The Crown Estate.
In line with our disciplined strategy of recycling capital out of mature assets, over the course of the year we made selected disposals including the sales of Bond Street House, W1, Spirella House, W1, 79 83 Great Portland Street, W1 and 29 35 Great Portland Street, W1 for a total of 62.3 million.
Overall, the aggregate proceeds from these sales was 5.1% in excess of their combined book value at 31 March 2009.
In all three cases, we had enhanced the value of the properties through refurbishment, headlease regearing or asset management activities and judged that we could put our capital to better use elsewhere.
We also disposed of 50% of our interest in the Bishopsgate, EC3 properties, which is described in the development section below.
In December, Crossrail acquired 18 19 Hanover Square, W1 via a compulsory purchase order CPO under the Crossrail Act 2008 to enable the development of the Bond Street Crossrail station.
The cash received by GPE from the CPO was 35.9 million and we are in the process of an extensive valuation claim to recover further funds.
In May 2010, we agreed to create a new 50:50 joint venture with Starwood Capital Group, The Great Star Partnership GSP to own City Tower, 40 Basinghall Street, EC2, valued at 35 million, and have simultaneously acquired a neighbouring building, City Place House, 55 Basinghall Street, The 100 EC2 for 94 million which we intend to add to GSP.
Bishopsgate Our joint ventures Partnership It has been a year of significant expansion with a number of major transactions across our six joint created ventures as described above.
The major events of the year were the acquisition with Eurohypo of Marcol House, 289 295 Regent Street and 23 24 Newman Street, W1 in November 2009 and the creation of The 100 Bishopsgate Partnership in March 2010, which is described in the development section below.
The JVs have delivered good relative portfolio performance at Group level for the second half and, through them, we have brought in a number of assets with exciting repositioning, refurbishment and redevelopment potential.
Our JV partners are all well regarded, long term, major owners of UK real estate and who rely on our specialism in the central London markets.

Joint venture business contribution to the Group Values at 31 March 2010 Our JVs are increasingly material to the Group, making up 53.9% of properties under management, 37.9% of net assets and 37.5% of rent roll at 31 March 2010 at 31 March 2009: 45.7%, 32.2% and 28.9% respectively.
We believe that the JVs will continue to provide a competitive advantage to the Group as their portfolios provide us with a source of rental growth opportunity in combination with partners who are supportive in terms of capital, reputation and relationships.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2010 22 Our business Asset management Good property companies are defined by the quality and success of their asset management activities and we have had another strong year.
We have continued to prioritise both high occupancy through tenant retention and a focused leasing effort and strong cash flow generation with good results: 144 new leases were completed 2009: 89 leases generating annual rent of 13.3 million our share 11.2 million: 2009: 9.9 million or 16.5% of rent roll: 71% of all tenancies by area, with lease breaks or expiries in the year to 31 March 2010, were 3.4% retained or relet, up from 57% for the year to 30 September 2009: void rate a further 25 lettings were under offer at 31 March 2010, accounting for 1.6 million p. a. in rent our share 1.2 million : ten rent reviews of 2.4 million our share 1.6 million: 2009: 3.6 million were settled during the year, some 1% ahead of ERV at the rent review date: and total space covered by new lettings, reviews and renewals during the year was 494,000 sq ft 2009: 473,000 sq ft. New lettings and renewals by quarter m 5.5 5.0 4.1m 4.5 11.6 3.8m 43 leases 4.0 35 leases 3.5 2.9m 3.0 2.5m 30 leases 2.5 36 leases 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0 Jun 09 Sep 09 Dec 09 Mar 10 These asset management successes drove the investment portfolio void rate at 31 March 2010 down to 3.4% versus 7.8% at last year end.
Leasing activity was strong throughout the second half with 60% of these recent lettings in line with the valuers September 2009 estimates, whilst the balance were well below the September 2009 ERV because they incorporated landlords breaks to allow possible redevelopment during the next three years.
In the year to 31 March 2010, 169 leases covering around 428,000 sq ft of space with a rental Retention case study value of 11.3 million were subject to lease expiry or tenant break.
Tenants were retained for 71% P10O of this space by area and by the end of March 2010 we had leased or put under offer a further 16% leaving only 7% to transact after stripping out the 6% where we need vacant possession to enable development.
Development In November 2009, we highlighted that we felt the time was right to increase our development exposure once more to take advantage of improving occupational demand and constrained supply.
We have recently started work at two sites, Marcol House, 289 295 Regent Street and 23 24 Newman Street, W1, have a further seven projects which can start by June 2011 and are examining ways to accelerate selected schemes.
The Groups exciting total programme potentially stretches to 2.8 million sq ft across central London, timed to benefit from the recovery in occupational markets.
Taken together, these opportunities cover 53% of the Groups properties by area and, when finished, will see their net lettable area increase by 80%.
We divide the total development programme into two segments depending on the start date.
The near-term group of nine schemes can all be on site by the end of 2011.
The pipeline projects will be started after 2011.

Construction and leasing At our 112,800 sq ft Wells & More, Mortimer Street, W1 building we leased the final part floor in November meaning the office element of the building is fully let.
We have recently agreed to lease 102,500 sq ft two of the three retail units and discussions are ongoing with several potential tenants in respect of the last remaining unit.
The 46,800 sq ft Woolyard, Bermondsey Street, SE1 scheme is now over Marcol House 75% let or under offer and we have encouraging levels of interest for the balance.
development on site Recent project starts Strip out works at Marcol House, 289 295 Regent Street, W1 started in March 2010 and following demolition and rebuilding, we are aiming for practical completion in 2012.
The residential scheme at 23 24 Newman Street, W1 has also started this year.
Project preparation In March 2010, we announced the sale of a 50% interest in The 100 Bishopsgate Partnership to Brookfield Properties Corporation BPO for 43.0 million in cash.
This JV holds all of GPEs Bishopsgate properties which form the 100 Bishopsgate development site in the heart of the City of London.
Planning Consent for the two acre EC3 site was achieved by GPE in May 2008 for a 40 storey building providing 765,800 sq ft of offices, ancillary retail and a new public library, together with a second building of 49,600 sq ft containing offices and a new Livery Hall for The Worshipful Company of Leathersellers.
The 100 Bishopsgate Partnership intends to prepare the scheme for a potential start date in 2011 12 subject to a variety of partner approvals.
BPO will act as Development Manager to the Partnership and has also entered a pre-construction services agreement to act as the main contractor for the development.
GPE will continue to act as both Property and Asset Manager.
At Hanover Square, W1 discussions on our masterplan proposals continue with Crossrail and having received a favourable response from a number of stakeholders to our design proposals, we anticipate submitting a planning application later in 2010.
Meanwhile, detailed design work is ongoing to prepare schemes at Wigmore Street, W1, Walmar House, Regent Street, W1 and Fetter Lane, EC4 for commencement over the next two years.
