The lack of both liquidity and available credit drove a dramatic decrease in the volume of commercial property transactions in London and the UK as a whole.
This contributed to a fall in UK commercial property values by over 40% from the peak of the market in June 2007.
It was against this backdrop that we approached shareholders to raise 166 million through a Rights Issue to provide additional resources to take advantage of these depressed prices.
Our objective was to invest all of the proceeds within 18 months of the Rights Issue and ahead of this objective we had invested or committed 97% of the money by 31 December 2009 on a number of attractive opportunities.
With property markets at a 30 year low, we have reentered the market and invested the Groups money in a number of acquisitions.
Ben Chambers Investment Director timing is everything... As we entered 2009, real capital values were at their lowest level for over 30 years.
