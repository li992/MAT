Our performance is influenced by economic conditions, Fibre-based broadband roll out as recessionary periods increase the risk of business failure and loss of line rental, and low activity in the housing market reduces churn and hence connections.
In prior years, poor weather had a Phase 1 significant impact on the network increasing faults, but following Phase 2 improvements in sealing the network, it is now only affected by severe weather conditions.
Phase 3 Our 19,000 eld engineers work on behalf of all CPs, enabling Phase 4a them to provide their customers with a range of services from analogue telephone lines to complex networked IT services.
Phase 4b To meet our customers requirements with a greater degree of Phase 5 exibility and efficiency, an agreement was reached with the CWU to introduce more exible working hours, effective from April 2010.
Openreach operates a fleet of more than 20,000 vehicles and is committed to nding innovative ways to minimise its environmental impact.
During the year we equipped more than 13,000 vans with satellite location technology that, together with improved business practices, will save time, reduce our carbon footprint and improve our responsiveness to customer needs.

The 2010 Some key customers are taking the decision to reduce ongoing decrease reects lower Ethernet prices, a reduced WLR base due rental costs by moving from WLR and Shared Metallic Path Facility to the depressed housing market and the difficult economic SMPF to MPF, taking advantage of the difference in the regulated conditions.

Net operating costs decreased by 1% in 2010 2009: 4% decrease.
Cost reductions have been achieved through a decrease in total labour costs, process improvements and efficiencies and a reduction in the number of faults due to the improved quality of our network and lower levels of connection activity.
