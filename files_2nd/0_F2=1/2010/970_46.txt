The use of methanedrainage flaring is expected to reduce the mines greenhouse gas emissions by 15%.
Owing to the inconsistent quantity and quality of the vented methane, it is not feasible for the mine to capture and use it as a source of energy 1 This figure differs from the 105 million GJ reported in 2009 because of amendments in calculation methodologies.
