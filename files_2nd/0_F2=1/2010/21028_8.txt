This analysis demonstrates the significance of the local currency asset class which has grown further in the period, the allocation of funds invested into corporate debt and the reduction of the percentage of special situations assets over the last year reflecting the strong inflows into the liquid themes.

Management fee margins were reduced in line with the receipt of the strongest inflows within the most liquid themes, external debt and local currency, which have the lower margins.
In addition the majority of inflows into these themes were received in the form of larger segregated mandates which are lower margin in nature.
Likewise those flows into the currency hedging overlay strategy attract a lower management fee in line with the hedging rather than active management nature of the mandate.
