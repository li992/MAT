600 Pensions 500 The Group operates both a defined benefit pension scheme, which closed 400 to new entrants on 31 December 2007, and an occupational defined contribution arrangement which began on 1 January 2008.
300 200 The deficit under IAS 19 of the defined benefit scheme of 119.4 million, 100 at 31 March 2009, has increased to 133.1 million at 31 March 2010.
This is mainly due to a reduction in the discount rate assumption to 5.5% Other NWL appointed 2009: 6.1%, partially offset by an increase in the market value of the schemes assets since March 2009.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme as at 31 December 2007 resulted in a surplus of 42.0 million 6% on an ongoing basis, which took into account the prepaid contributions in 2006 and 2007 for the period up to 31 December 2010.
While the actuarial valuation incorporates longer term forecasts and assumptions than the IAS 19 valuation, the prevailing market conditions are difficult and we will continue to monitor carefully.
Furthermore, the final determination to March 2015 reflected NWLs request to fund 6.0 million per annum in respect of the defined benefit pension deficit from 1 January 2012.
