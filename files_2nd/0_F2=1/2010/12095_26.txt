Petropavlovsk Annual Report 2010 Gold Reserves & Resources Following an extensive exploration programme conducted during 2010, the Group was pleased to announce a significant uplift in gold Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources in accordance with the JORC Code 2004.
This uplift underlines the effectiveness of the Groups strategy of delivering low-cost organic growth through exploration success.

The proposed open pits will require 1,340Mt of waste to be removed in order to access the ore body at a stripping ratio of 5.6t t. A further 0.4Moz of Inferred Mineral Resource exists within the optimised pit shells.

It should be noted that Mineral Resources are inclusive of Ore Reserves.
Estimates are provided as of 01 January 2011 and are based on a long term gold price of US$1,000 oz.
Note: figures may have been rounded.
In addition to the reserves and resources, estimated in accordance with the JORC Code 2004, the Group also holds significant Russian classified alluvial gold reserves and resources, as presented below: Total alluvial reserves Total alluvial resources in accordance with the Russian Classification System in accordance with the Russian Classification System Volume Grade Contained Volume Grade Contained 3 3 3 3 Category 000 m g m Au Metal Moz Category 000 m g m Au Metal Moz B 1,443 0.23 0.01 B 5,798 0.11 0.02 C 46,491 0.36 0.53 C 74,613 0.32 0.77 1 1 B C 47,934 0.35 0.54 B C 80,411 0.30 0.79 1 1 C 3,674 0.34 0.04 C 9,697 0.86 0.27 2 2 Total B C C 51,609 0.35 0.58 Total B C C 90,108 0.36 1.06 1 2 1 2 Notes: 1 Alluvial resources are reported inclusive of alluvial ore reserves: 2 Ore reserves include only on-balance material for open cut and dredge extraction: resources include the ore reserves, off-balance material for open pit and dredge extraction as well as on-balance and off-balance material considered for potential underground mining: 3 As per the Russian Classification System, ore reserves are reported at in-situ grade and tonnage, however it has been demonstrated that the material remains economically viable after application of the reasonably assumed or estimated modifying factors such as mining dilution and recovery: 4 In August 2010 the Group increased its total holding in ZAO ZRK Omchak to 90%.
Omchak became a subsidiary of the Group and production from the assets held by Omchak from H2 2010 onwards is 100% attributable to the Group.
