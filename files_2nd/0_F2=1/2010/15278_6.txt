The remaining business, manufacturing facilities in Barcelona, Spain and Cuernavaca, William Blythe, is a worldwide supplier of inorganic specialities Mexico.

Products are used in a range of applications such as distribute the finished dosage form.
semiconductor manufacture, pharmaceutical actives, non-toxic flame retardants, safety glass coatings and catalysts.
Destocking at most of our customers finished in the first six months, and the order book strengthened through the year.
During the period, William Blythe traded ahead of 2009.
However, following the weak start to the year, the business ended the year with operating profits some 1.1 million below 2009.
Costs remained in line with expectations, even after taking into account utility and raw material price rises.
This was achieved by continued productivity and process improvements throughout the year.
Our strategy of selective dossier development saw the approval of a marketing authorisation in Portugal for Omeprazole.
We intend to roll this out to the wider European market over the next 18 months.
The strategy of registration of other marketing authorisations of an enlarged range of generic products was developed during 2010, and we made our first finished dosage sales of Pantoprazole.
In Mexico the sales increases of 2009 were consolidated in 2010, through a strong increase in generic sales versus ethical products.

This investment has paid off with well over 50% of sales in 2010 from products introduced in the last three years.
One example is our self crosslinking grade which removes the need for accelerators in the glove dipping process which can cause allergies thereby creating a premium product for the glove market.
