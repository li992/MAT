2010 RA 1-19 final:Layout 1 14 12 10 15:22 Page 9 Investment Review Electra made good progress in the financial year to 30 September 2010.
This was particularly pleasing in view of the uncertain market and economic conditions which existed throughout the year.
The net asset value per share increased from 1,720p to 2,050p, an increase of 19% which compares to a decline in value of 4.5% and 10% in the two previous financial years.
The growth in net assets amounted to 330p per share or 117 million in total.
This was made up primarily of realised and unrealised appreciation of the investment portfolio of 129 million, together with income from the investment portfolio of 28 million and foreign exchange gains on loans of 6 million, offset by expenses of 30 million and provisions under various incentive schemes of 16 million.

The increase in activity reflected improvements in the private equity market following two years of turmoil in the financial markets.
The net capital increase of 129 million provided a welcome return to value growth after two years of negative returns.
A significant element of the net capital increase in the year arose from investments realised, increased operating profits of portfolio companies and the benefits flowing from the restructuring of portfolio companies.
Overall the portfolio has exhibited good defensive qualities and progress has been made in all segments.

This improvement is expected to continue as the current overhang of private equity funding diminishes.
Electra enters the new financial year with a portfolio which has shown considerable resilience to difficult conditions, is conservatively financed and has good prospects for further value growth even if the economy remains weak.
Most of the factors which have made private equity successful in the last two decades continue to be valid in todays changed circumstances and the market is expected to provide an increasing flow of investment opportunities.
With its experienced management team, strong market position and flexible approach to capital structuring Electra is well placed to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise.
Investments In the year to 30 September 2010 new investment by Electra totalled 183 million compared to 88 million in the previous year.
This represented a substantial uplift in activity and was achieved despite our cautious investment stance in view of concerns about the European economy.
Therefore, while there was a marked increase in the volume and quality of the deal flow, rather than taking significant risks in new situations, there was a preference for strengthening the existing portfolio.
Of the total 183 million, 107 million was invested in existing portfolio companies, primarily for financing acquisitions, with the balance of 76 million being invested in new portfolio companies.
The most significant new acquisitions were in respect of esure, Kalle and CPA.
esure, in which Electra invested 29.7 million, was founded by Peter Wood who has had a highly successful track record in motor insurance, having previously founded Direct Line in 1985. esures aim has been to develop the internet as a channel for insurance.
The firm has grown strongly since it was founded in 2000 and now has two well established brands in esure and Sheilas Wheels.
esure recently exercised an option to acquire a 50% stake in Gocompare, an internet insurance aggregator, which is one of four leading UK players in this fast growing market.

Kalle is a market leader in all its market segments, has good defensive characteristics and is run by an experienced and high quality management team.
Having tracked CPA Global for a number of years, Electra invested 13.9 million in the company in July 2010.
CPA Globals core business is patent renewals where it is a global leader enjoying 50-60% of the total market place.
CPA Global has a number of ancillary businesses and is considered an attractive investment opportunity with significant growth prospects.
In terms of the existing portfolio, the combination of Baxi and fide Dietrich Remeha to form BDR Thermea which was described in the Half Year Report, has produced significant benefits not least in overcoming the financial issues which Baxi faced as an independent entity.
BDR Thermea is a leading manufacturer and distributor of heating and hot water systems and services operating in more than 70 countries worldwide and employing over 6,400 people.
It is the third largest heating products business in Europe with a market leading position in several major European countries.
The synergies resulting from the combined businesses provide good profit growth potential for Electras investment which had a value of 62.5 million at 30 September 2010.
In December, Electra provided 23.6 million of funding to Premier Asset Management to purchase the management contracts of circa 900 million of retail funds.
This transaction increased Premiers funds under management by more than 60% and provided significant synergistic benefits, greatly strengthening Premiers strategic position in the retail funds market while providing a platform for further acquisitions.
In July, Electra provided 17.3 million of further funding to Rio Trens Corporation RTC.
RTC has an interest in a company which holds the concession to operate a Brazilian transportation company.
The funding was provided primarily for the purchase of a new signalling system to increase the capacity of the network.
The whole of Electras investment in Rio Trens Corporation was subsequently realised in November 2010 as described below.
Realisations During the year Electra received 125 million from the disposal of portfolio investments, a level of realisations representing a substantial increase from the previous year when realisations were almost non-existent.
This included 40.1 million from the combination of Baxi and fide Dietrich Remeha which was subsequently reinvested in BDR Thermea.
The improvement in the market culminated in the disposal of two further investments, MPS and Thermocoax in the second half of the year.

Based in the Netherlands and employing 500 people worldwide, MPS is the global leader in the development, production and installation of abattoir equipment.
In October 2008 Electra invested 21 million in MPS.
This was sold in August 2010 generating gross proceeds to Electra of 42 million, a multiple on the investment of 2 times in slightly under two years.
Electra also realised its investment in specialist engineering products manufacturer Thermocoax, as part of a secondary investment in a French fund purchased three years ago.
This disposal generated net proceeds to Electra of 15.2 million compared to an original cost of 4.6 million.
In addition to these two disposals, Electra realised most of its investment in Credit Opportunities as the recovery in the secondary debt market allowed the majority of the anticipated return to be earned earlier than expected.
Shortly after the year end, in November 2010, Electra accepted an offer to sell its entire interest in Rio Trens Corporation for proceeds of approximately $87 million.
This brought to a successful conclusion an investment which had originally been made in 1998.
Following initial problems which required a full provision to be made against the cost of the investment, a lengthy financial and operational restructuring has allowed value to be recreated in the last two years, culminating in this successful disposal.
Performance Over the year to 30 September 2010, Electras investment portfolio increased in value in capital terms by 129 million, a percentage increase over the opening value of 23.6%.
In addition the portfolio provided income over the year to Electra of 28 million.
Including income, the portfolio provided a total return over the year of 29%.
The performance was negatively impacted by currency markets which reduced the return over the year by 11 million.

Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 12 2010 RA 1-19 final:Layout 1 14 12 10 15:22 Page 13 Of the capital profits of 129 million, 15 million was realised on the sale of unlisted investments and 2 million related to the listed portfolio.
Unrealised appreciation of the unlisted portfolio thus amounted to 112 million.
Of this amount, 49 million reflected the net impact of corporate activity and financial restructuring and 46 million reflected increases in the profitability of portfolio companies.
The remaining amount related to a variety of factors including yield changes of property investments and the reduction of debt in portfolio companies.
Changes in multiples used to value individual investments reduced the overall portfolio valuation by 10 million.
Investments in private equity funds managed independently provided 7 million of the unrealised gains recognised during the year.
In terms of individual investments, 29.9 million was added to the valuation of Rio Trens Corporation to reflect the offer for the company which resulted in its disposal in November 2010 and 21 million was added to the value of Electras interest in the Steadfast Capital fund.
During the year two investments were realised from this fund giving rise to 17 million of realised profits with 4 million being added to the value of the remaining investments.
The continuing positive progress of Allflex allowed 21.2 million to be added to the carrying value of the investment, mainly in recognition of an improvement in underlying profitability.
In the case of Capital Safety Group, the company experienced a strong rebound in revenue and profits allowing 11.7 million to be added to the carrying value.
Good progress allowed further gains to be recognised in the case of Zensar, SAV Credit, Amtico and Pine while the valuation of esure which was purchased during the financial year was increased to reflect better than expected profitability from its recently acquired interest in Gocompare.
Total provisions against the valuation of unlisted investments amounted to 16.3 million during the year of which Labco and Greenpark accounted for 5.1 million and 5.2 million respectively.
