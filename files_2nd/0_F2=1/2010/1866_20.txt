1 % In the fi first half of the year, activity in our later cycle Aftermarket Services and Systems division continued to decline as expected.
It returned to growth in the second half of the year as the impact of increased fl ying hours over the prior 6-9 months began to feed through to increased aftermarket demand.
Organic growth of 3% in the second half offset the revenue decline in the fi first half, and for the year as a whole revenue of 441.4 million was broadly fl at on an organic basis 2009: 437.0 million.
Operating profi ts of 48.0 million were in line with the prior year 2009: 48.5million and operating margins were also broadly maintained at 10.9% 2009: 11.1%.
Included within operating profi t was a 3.0 million net pension curtailment gain realised in the fi first half and which partly off set the absence of a 4.6million profi t realised in 2009 on the accelerated sale of engines in ERO.
