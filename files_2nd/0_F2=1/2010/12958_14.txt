Kibali development project The Kibali gold project is a gold exploration property which 2 covers an area of approximately 1 836 km in the north east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The majority of gold mineralisation identified to date is disseminated style, hosted within a sequence of coarse volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks.
The mineralisation is associated with quartz-carbonate alteration and pyrite.

The Aru Doko road is particularly significant as it links Kibali with international ports.
The implementation of the RAP is already underway, with the acquisition from the state of the site for a new town, to be known as Kokiza, as well as farmland.
Model homes have been built and the process of house selection by each of the families involved has started.
The company and its partners continue to work with the local community to alleviate the loss of income derived from illegal informal mining, which has been ended on the site.
Alternative work programmes have already been created and these include the production of basic building materials to be used for the construction of the RAP houses as well as the mine.
Progress on other fronts includes the substantial upgrading of the regional infrastructure through the completion ahead of schedule of Randgold Resources 40 Annual report 2010 KIBALI uNDERGROuND MINE DESIGN to the shaft progress.
