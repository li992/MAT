The key principles adopted in the preparation of the combined businesses basis of reporting are described below.
In order to reflect the impact of the acquisition of HBOS, the following adjustments have been made: the 2009 results assume HBOS had been owned throughout the year: the gain on acquisition of HBOS in 2009 and amortisation of purchased intangible assets have been excluded: and the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments is shown as one line in the combined businesses income statement.
In order to better present the underlying business performance the following items, not related to acquisition accounting, have also been excluded: integration costs: insurance and policyholder interests volatility: the Government Asset Protection Scheme GAPS fee paid in 2009: goodwill impairment: the curtailment gain in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes: the customer goodwill payments provision: and loss on disposal of businesses.
Further, to enable a better understanding of the Groups core business trends and outlook, certain income statement and balance sheet information is analysed between core and non-core portfolios.
Non-core portfolios consist of non-relationship assets and liabilities, together with assets and liabilities which are outside the Groups current appetite.
The EU mandated retail business disposal is not included in non-core portfolios.
A full reconciliation of the combined businesses basis to the statutory basis is given in note 4 on page 170.
Unless otherwise stated, the commentaries on pages 13 to 55 are on a combined businesses basis.
