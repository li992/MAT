Contingenciesand Provisions The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In making its estimates, management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings and settlement negotiations orif investigations bring to light new facts.
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.
Although it is Group policy to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any given time the Group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits.
Significant issues may take several years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into account the views of internal and external advisors and updates the amount of provision whenever necessary.
The ultimate tax liability may differ fromthe amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations orchanges in legislation.

The Groups principal manufacturing locations are in the US Orthopaedics and Endoscopy, Switzerland Orthopaedics, UK Advanced Wound Management and Orthopaedics and China Orthopaedics and Advanced Wound Management.
The majority of the Groups selling and distribution subsidiaries around the world purchase finished products from these locations.
As a result of currency movements compared with the previous year, purchases from the US became relatively more expensive for Europe and the UK and relatively less expensive for Australia, Japan and Switzerland.
The Groups policyof purchasing forwarda proportionof its currency requirements mitigated the impact of these movements.

Unfavourable currency movements have contributed to the remaining 1% movement.
 Administrative expenses decreased by $67m -13% to $446m from $513m in 2009.
The principal factors contributing to the underlying movement of -14% were a $32m reduction in the amortisation and impairment charge of intangible assets, a $7m reduction in acquisition related costs and a decrease of $5m in restructuring and rationalisation expenses.
