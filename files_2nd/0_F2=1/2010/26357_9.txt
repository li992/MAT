However, there continue to be material uncertainties as to future Previously, we set out our strategy to reduce non-core assets, capital requirements and therefore we cannot be more specific at including non-relationship assets and businesses which are outside this stage.
our current appetite, by some 200 billion from a non-relationship pool of 300 billion.
It continues to be our intention to manage these assets for value and, given the current economic climate, our primary focus remains on running these assets down over time.
This strategy has been very effective and so far reductions of 105 billion have been achieved.
Outlook balance sheet We are confident of achieving our targeted further reductions in non-core assets of approximately 100 billion over the next three years.
In addition, we continue to progress plans to execute the divestment of retail assets and liabilities in line with our state aid obligations.
The balance sheet reduction over time is providing the Group with increased optionality and flexibility from the resultant releases in both funding and capital.
Together with initiatives to increase customer deposits in line with market growth, we expect to reduce the proportion of the Groups funding that is derived from wholesale markets and eliminate our use of government and central bank facilities by the end of 2012.
This will provide capacity for core business growth in line with our relationship strategy.
In 2011, however, we expect to see a continuation in the trend of customer deleveraging and generally subdued demand for new lending.

Outlook liquidity and funding A strengthened liquidity and funding position We expect the combination of continued increases in customer The Group made excellent progress against its funding objectives in deposits and reductions in assets primarily from non-core asset 2010 and further enhanced its liquidity position which is supported by reduction plans over the next three years to deliver further a robust and stable customer deposit base.
While total customer improvements in the Groups liquidity and funding position.

three years, a reduction in wholesale funding requirements and therefore levels of ongoing term issuance, and liquidity levels to be The Group has continued to reduce its reliance on short-term maintained in excess of regulatory requirements.
During the year the absolute level of Group wholesale funding fell to 298.0 billion, from 325.5 billion at the end of 2009, reflecting a reduction in balance sheet assets.
By the end of 2010, our loan to deposit ratio, excluding repos and reverse repos, had improved to 154 per cent.
Strong term issuance in 2010 also allowed the Group to maintain its maturity profile of wholesale funding with 50 per cent of wholesale funding having a maturity date greater than one year at 31 December 2010.
As previously guided, over the next couple of years the Group expects its public capital and senior funding issuance to be 20 billion to 25 billion per annum.
We made excellent progress in 2010 on our term funding issuance plans, achieving 30 billion of publicly placed term issuance in the year.
In addition, the Group issued a further 20 billion of term funding during the year via a series of privately placed funding transactions, a level which we do not expect to repeat in 2011.
The Group continues to benefit from a diversity of funding sources.
For example, during the year, we established a new funding programme in the US with our SEC Registered Shelf, issued inaugural Japanese Yen Samurai, Swiss Franc and Canadian Dollar bonds, and publicly launched the Lloyds TSB Bank plc Covered Bond Programme.
We continue to look for opportunities to diversify our funding sources.
We welcome the proposals on minimum standards for funding liquidity published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010.
The introduction of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio will raise the resilience of banks to potential liquidity shocks and provide the basis for a harmonised approach to liquidity risk management.
These proposals are subject to ongoing refinement and have not yet been enacted into UK and European law.
However, the Group monitors compliance against these internal metrics, and as at 31 December 2010, the Groups Liquidity Coverage Ratio was estimated at 71 per cent and the Net Stable Funding Ratio at 88 per cent.
The actions already in place to reduce the size of the balance sheet are expected to ensure compliance with the future minimum standards, which are expected to be 100 per cent for both ratios, by their respective effective dates.

This has been partly offset by a charge to net interest income of 301 million.
The impact of the fair value unwind on net interest income is lower than in 2009 because the liability management exercises undertaken by the Group have had the effect of crystallising a proportion of the gains reflected in the opening balance sheet valuation of HBOSs own debt: there has also been a benefit from revised expectations of future impairment losses likely to emerge from certain retail lending portfolios.
