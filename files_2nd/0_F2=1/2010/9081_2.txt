Keller Group plc 03 Our services United Kingdom Piling and Earth retention In the UK, Keller operates as Keller Piling involves the installation of structural elements to transfer Foundations, Keller Geotechnique, foundation loads through weak soils to stronger underlying ground.
Phi Group and Colcrete-Eurodrill Keller offers a wide range of piling and earth retention systems which, together, have a national presence including diaphragm walls and marine piles.
Piles may be preformed offering a wide range of ground and driven into the ground or cast in situ.
Keller has installed piles engineering solutions.
underpinning many major building and civil engineering projects around the world.
Specialty grouting Specialty grouting strengthens target areas in the ground and controls ground water flow through rocks and soils by reducing their permeability.
It is applicable to both new construction projects and to repair and maintenance work.
Other applications include excavation support, settlement control and geo-environmental services to protect adjacent ground from contamination.
Revenue Anchors, Nails and Minipiles Anchors, nails and minipiles can provide temporary or permanent solutions for a wide range of stability or support problems and are 49.6m often used to underpin or stabilise buildings, slopes and 2009: 57.6m embankments.
Ground improvement Operating loss profit Ground improvement techniques are used to prepare the ground for new construction projects and to reduce the risk of liquefaction in areas of seismic activity.
2.5m 2009: 0.5m Keller was the first to develop methods and equipment for the successful deep compaction of soil in the 1930s and has continued to develop the equipment and widen its application.
Common soil stabilisation techniques include a combination of vibro-compaction with stone, concrete or lime columns as well as soil mixing and Revenue m injection systems, which have been used by Keller to improve many 06 60.7 thousands of sites around the world.

Suncoasts post-tension systems are used in foundation slabs for single family homes and, in the commercial high-rise sector, in concrete structural spans and beams.
