ORDINARY SHARES Managers Report Ordinary Share Class Chris Turner MRICS Fund Manager 10 June 2010 Performance Facts first over the financial year ending in March 2010 the Ordinary share class NAV total return of 52.6% compared to a benchmark total return of 60.6% an underperformance gap of 8.0%.
The share price total return at 60.5% was only a whisker below the benchmark thanks to the discount to NAV narrowing over the year.
My errors that led to this NAV underperformance are very irritating to my pride, particularly as this has been the first year in the last decade that the NAV total return has not outperformed.
In my defence, I would like to note that taken over the two years March 2008 to March 2010, the NAV total return has been -9.2% while the benchmark total return has been -17.4%.
All the NAV underperformance occurred in the first six months to September 2009.
In that period I was badly wrong footed by the speed and totality of the change in sentiment.
Having outperformed by being cautious and by holding up to 20% of the share capital in cash through the previous year, I found it impossible to believe the right approach was not to reinvest this cash gradually to avoid being caught in another false dawn.
Like the rest of the stock market, property shares took off into orbit, rising 50% in five months, leaving unfit old codgers like myself panting in their wake.
Two other personal traits were of no help either.
Firstly, I am, by nature, a rather slow investor, taking pride in having a low investment turnover, but this was a period when I should have been extremely active.
Secondly, retail investors are a majority of the shareholders of the Trust and would I buy this for my mother is an investment test I use from time to time.
After the dire uncertainties of 2008, the desire to ensure capital preservation made it harder than usual to buy into the high risk companies whose shares outperformed so strongly in the rally.

The cash was spent withholding taxes.
At the end of September gross cash was down to 4.5m and, after deducting the debenture debt, the share class had net borrowings of 7.7m equivalent to 1.6% of gross assets.
In November we renewed our one year revolving credit facility for 50m of which the Ordinary class has 40m.
At the end of the financial year we had 47m of debt made up of 12m from the Debenture and 35m from the bank facility.
The cash of 9.8m shown in the balance sheet was mostly swallowed up in paying the second interim dividend of 8.9m the day after the year end.
Direct Property Portfolio The physical property portfolio produced a total return of 13.1% for the year to 31 March 2010, comprising an income return of 7.7% and capital growth of 5.4%.
The portfolio underperformed the Investment Property Databank Monthly index which produced a total return of 16.3%, comprised of an income return of 8.1% and a capital return of 7.6%.
There were no sales or purchases during the year and the team continued to concentrate on asset management of the existing portfolio.
At the Colonnades we suffered two bankruptcies in the first half of the year affecting some 18% of the income from the building.
The 7,200 sq ft of office space has been subdivided and half has been relet as has the small caf with only a minimal void.
The residential lease extensions continued, producing over 250,000 premium income taken as capital receipts over the year.
At our industrial estate in Wandsworth we let one of the two small vacant workshop and storage units at 12.50 per sq ft and have placed the other under offer.
As reported at the half year, we agreed a new lease with the tenant of our Milton Keynes office building, Exel Europe Limited DHL.
The vacancy rate on the portfolio at the end of the year was 2.8% and this will fall to 2% following the completion of the lease at Wandsworth.
In contrast the void rate in the IPD Monthly Index finished the year at 10.8%.
We have three further leases expiring in 2010 in the portfolio, all at the Colonnades.
Discussions are in hand for the renewal of all three tenants.
The current rents passing on these leases represent just below 5% of the portfolios rent roll.
