We want to be recognised for our high quality science medicine requires a signi cant investment of and for the impact we can make on serious diseases.
We also want resources by research-based pharmaceutical to continue to be trusted.
This means setting and living up to high standards of ethical practice across all aspects of our research companies over a period of 10 or more years.
For this to be a viable investment, the results new medicines must be safeguarded from You can read more about our standards of ethical practice and 2010 performance in the Responsible Business section from being copied with a reasonable amount of page 40. certainty for a reasonable period of time.
The principal economic safeguard in our industry is a wellfunctioning patent system that recognises our effort and rewards our innovation with appropriate protection, allowing time to generate the revenue we need to reinvest in new pharmaceutical innovation.
We have con dence in our inventions and commit signi cant resources both to establishing and defending the patent and related intellectual property protections for these inventions.
Patent process Applications for patent protection are led on our inventions to safeguard the large subsequent investment required to get potential new drugs approved for marketing.
