East Africa West Africa 1 Case study: Production growth 2 3 3 4 5 3.
Delivering Against our Strategy 6 7 8 Ebok.
11 12 In February 2011, we successfully installed the production and storage facilities and 13 commenced production operations at the Ebok field.
The phased development 14 approach adopted by Afren and our partner Oriental Energy Resources, combined 15 with the decision to utilise a Mobile Offshore Production Unit MOPU and Floating 16 Storage Offloading vessel FSO, has allowed us to fast track development of the 17 field where our initial three well appraisal drilling campaign more than quadrupled 18 gross reserves to 106.2 mmbbls.
This innovative development concept has also 19 generated cost savings of an estimated US$51 million in up-front costs and day rate 20 charges compared to other options that wereconsidered.
21 22 Development Phase 1 is targeting the Central area of the field, and Phase 2 the 23 West Fault Block.
Un-manned 12-slot wellhead platforms have also been installed 24 at each location and tied back to the MOPU, where crude oil is stabilised before 25 being stored in the FSO for sale directly to the international market.
26 27 In December 2010, three out of five Phase 1 production wells were tested at a 28 constrained aggregate rate of 12,500 bopd.
Development drilling for Phase 2 will 29 see a further four production wells and up to two water injection wells sequentially 30 drilled, completed and commissioned.
Gross output from Phases 1 and 2 alone is 31 expected to reach 35,000 bopd.
Post Phase 2 we intend to continue with ongoing 32 development of the field, targeting proven oil bearing reservoirs that will not have 33 been accessed by the first two phases and fully utilising the remaining available 34 production capacity at the MOPU.
35 36 Creating a new Nigerian production hub 37 Our success at Ebok has created follow-on opportunities for us to extend our 38 partnership with Oriental Energy Resources, and we were quick to secure positions 39 in the nearby Okwok field and surrounding OML 115 acreage.
In October we 40 successfully completed the Okwok-9 appraisal well having encountered 35ft oil pay 41 in the same D series reservoirs that are now in production at Ebok, and confirming 42 the field as a commercially viable development project.
Plans for 2011 include the 43 acquisition of 3D seismic and additional appraisal drilling to help define and scale 44 development requirements.
We will also be drilling exploration wells to test the Above: Constructing the MOPU at the Gulf Cooper Shipyard, Galverston USA.

Delivering Against our Strategy 6 7 8 Afren East Africa Exploration 9 10 realising our pan-African ambitions.
11 12 From inception, Afren has sought to establish itself as a pan-African E&P company 13 that is active across the full cycle value chain from exploration, appraisal, development SUDAN 14 through to production.
Now, with an established platform of cash generative 15 production in West Africa that we can leverage, it is an appropriate time for us to 16 extend our footprint to other less well explored parts of the continent that offer large 17 scale growth potential through the exploration drill-bit as part of abalancedportfolio.

Thepackage comprises 12 assets across 1bn bbls 25 Kenya, Madagascar, Seychelles and Ethiopia, all of which encouragingly have evidence 26 of working hydrocarbon systems beingpresent.
In March 2011 we announced the The Great Lakes Albertine 27 acquisition of a 74% interest in the Tanga Block, located offshore and onshore north UGANDA KENYA graben 1 billion bbls 28 east Tanzania.
The block lies south of and is contiguous with Afrens 100% owned 29 and operated blocks L17 L18 in Kenya, and contains a southerly extension of the same 30 coastal high and basin trough plays.
The acquisition represents a complementary 31 extension to our existing East African platform, and is an opportunity for Afren 32 toleverage its regional expertise and knowledge.
