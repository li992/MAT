New Service Incentive Mechanism SIM measures have been introduced by Ofwat for 2010 11.
These are being piloted and monitored during 2010 11, whereupon appropriate targets will be set.
For 2010 11, Ofwat has introduced the Service Incentive Mechanism SIM and, amongst other things, this will monitor the quality of our service rather than the quantitative results.
This year, improvements to customer service include a reduction in written complaint numbers by 22%, from 13,050 to 10,185.
Our complaint handling and billing query service has been subject to audit by CCWater and they have commented favourably on how we performed: 96% of the 50 cases reviewed in both areas being classed as good.
Debt recovery remains an important area, especially in the current economic climate, where, despite having some of the lowest charges in England and Wales, affordability is becoming an increasing concern for some customers.
We continue to be mindful of their circumstances, ensuring our recovery techniques are appropriate and effective.
Customers who deliberately avoid paying charges are actively pursued and we continue to work with Ofwat and Defra to seek changes to legislation to assist the industry to impose and collect charges.
