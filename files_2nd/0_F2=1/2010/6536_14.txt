16 Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Business Review Expenditure rose by 2.8m to 23.2m 2009: 20.4m.
On a constant currency basis, costs rose by 1.1m, primarily due to the higher D ivisional Review operating costs associated with the new porcine nucleus herd facilities in South Dakota and continued expansion of the bovine Research & Product stud facilities.
Development Product Development The product development programme continued to achieve a strong improvement in the genetic merit of the breeding animals it produces.
The bovine stud now has an exceptional range of top animals and the commissioning of the new and enlarged porcine nucleus herd facility will accelerate the already high genetic progress being made in the porcine sector.
The development process in the porcine nucleus farms uses proprietary genomics extensively to assist in the selection process and we have a leading position in this technology.
This knowledge and experience is being transferred into the bovine sector to enhance our lead over competitors.
Additional investment has been made in high performance computing to support the extensive Ian Biggs analysis of the large volumes of data necessary for the successful Head of Global Product & Business Strategy application of these genomic evaluations.
Also, we made progress with the fundamental science programme, meeting all the milestones set for leading projects.

2008 4.8 In creating and selecting new animals for this programme, because of the long lead time, the Group continually looks forward to the likely needs of agriculture at the time the bulls will graduate.
Over the last five years, the programme has concentrated on all round performance with an emphasis on robustness.
From publicly available data, we can confirm that the competitiveness of the Genus stud will be enhanced by graduations in the coming year.
In anticipation of world shortages in agricultural output and higher prevailing feed costs, the Group is continuing to refine the weighting of the traits in the selection process in its forward development programme.
Porcine Product Development The porcine development programme aims to achieve a continuous improvement in the genetics of the Groups proprietary range of nine pure pig lines.
These pure lines are crossed to create elite hybrid boars and gilts for the Groups operating businesses to multiply locally and supply breeding animals to regional customers.

Constructed to replace the ageing Kentucky facility and expand Group capacity, the farm will be fully operational by the end of September 2010.
However, we have already seen improvements in the rate of genetic progress from the greater selection pressure afforded by the larger population now under development.
During the year we also expanded our use of cross bred trials to measure the performance of Genus products in the production farming environment.
The results from these trials are being used to refine the selection process for robustness traits.
Fundamental Science The Group manages much of its fundamental research in educational establishments and with specialist research companies.
The product development programme However, as Genus is a market leader in this sector, all work on continued to achieve a strong improvement semen physiology and freezing is carried out in-house.
In addition, in the genetic merit of the breeding animals Genus monitors work undertaken in more than 500 research establishments around the world so that it can quickly identify the it produces.

In managing projects, Genus researchers have to justify project expenditure against the achievement of exacting milestones carefully set to monitor progress towards the commercial targets identified.
This year Genus has achieved continued progress against all the milestones set for an improved process for sorting semen.
High Performance Computing Genus has made a major investment this year in High Performance Computing to process data for genetic evaluation.
Normally used by top universities to carry out research, the High Performance Computing System has been introduced into the Genus Science Group to manage the rapid growth of genetic analysis in both the porcine and bovine businesses.
The computers allow fast access and retrieval of data and provide a storage capacity of over 20 Terabytes.

Adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax are the measures used by the Board to monitor underlying profitability.
The items excluded from adjusted operating profits are: Net IAS 41 valuation movement in biological assets: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets: Share-based payments: Exceptional items: and Other gains and losses.
Adjusted operating profit improved in the year by 5%, and adjusted profit before tax was 3% higher.
Cash generation was encouragingly strong even after continued investment in product development facilities.
The 12.9m cash inflow John Worby led to a reduction in net debt to 80.0m.
