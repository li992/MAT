The variance in operating profit over the year can be explained as follows: In South Africa, the revaluation of investment properties net of funding costs amounted to R398 million 2009: R230 million.
The prior period included significant fees earned on the completion of a number of projects Investment in the UK funds has started to generate revenue.
Development of the UK REITs has resulted in fees, dividends and profits from the sale of underlying investments The Australian division has benefited from revenue earned on the sale of an investment.
Developments UK and Europe The Property Investments business is fully operational and the UK REITs full discretionary product has a total of 13.4 million assets under management, in addition to a 5 million proprietary investment, since its launch in July 2009 The Investec GLL GSO Real Estate Fund has invested in eight properties in Chile 2, Argentina, USA 2, United Kingdom, Hungary and Poland.
The fund will continue to invest with caution in international direct commercial real estate, and endeavour to unlock value in the investment period of the fund.
A total of 375 million equity and debt was raised and of this 223 million has been invested The Investec Big Ben Property Fund Limited was launched on 1 December 2009 for select private, corporate and institutional clients investing alongside Investec.
The company seeks to invest in the commercial property markets of Great Britain and Ireland by unearthing opportunities that generate solid income streams and unlock value for shareholders.
The company is projected to raise 80 million and gear 120 million.
South Africa Market conditions are still uncertain and difficult to anticipate but our direct holdings are generally in a comfortable space as far as holding costs and acquisition prices are concerned, thereby allowing the business to be cautious and patient The ability to fund new grassroots developments is extremely expensive with yields hindering progress The global property products, i. e. investment in Investec GLL GSO Real Estate Fund I, UK REITs, and Investec Big Ben Property Fund with plans for the South African Property Fund and Investec GLL GSO Real Estate Fund II, provides a broader and diverse range of international property investment products for international investors.
Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 69 Property Activities continued Australia As at 31 March 2010, the Investec Property Opportunity Fund IPOF had invested A$100 million, with A$16 million available for future investment and or development opportunities The Property Investments division sub-underwrote the Abacus Property Group rights issue in March 2009.
These rights were converted into units in April 2009, a portion of which were sold during the year The business is seeking to raise a second IPOF in the third quarter of 2010 Total funds under management are A$252 million 2 Investec Property Investments are in the process of developing an investment business in Australia, to complement the existing property business.
Staff re-allocated from London to Sydney have been tasked with establishing a research function and developing business associations in this jurisdiction with the intention of commencing trading during the year.
Outlook, risks and uncertainties Although the global market remains volatile, the business believes that there are opportunities to acquire direct and listed property at attractive prices.
The business outlook for property for the next year remains cautiously optimistic with the annuity business supported by the diverse property product development initiatives that are underway.
UK and Europe The business has been able to source attractive real estate for the Investec GLL GSO Real Estate Fund in the UK and to date the fund is 62% invested and should be fully invested by the second half of 2010 Investment in UK REITs, and now more recently Australian REITs, provides access for our clients to a diverse portfolio of prime properties across different sectors in the UK, Australia and in some cases Europe.
Repricing in the sector and recapitalisation has reduced downside risks.
We now have an established track record in this space and intend to leverage off this in order to increase assets under management Investment opportunities into Australian REITs, IPOF II, Global REITs: SA Property Fund and Investec GLL GSO Real Estate Fund II will be offered to clients as further investment options and in a concerted drive to expand product within the business.
South Africa New developments have been hampered due to a reduction in tenant demand, and many opportunities were unable to achieve the required rental levels that would give an acceptable return.
Opportunities to enhance value of existing portfolios remain positive and the business will be more front footed on trading opportunities and the completion of current developments The business will proactively embark on trading and development of identified assets The Listed Property Investment business still has some capacity to procure a limited amount of new institutional business before full capacity is reached.
However, growth in assets under management is limited to the size and liquidity of the listed property sector Listed property as an asset class is forecast to continue delivering better total returns than most other asset classes.
This could result in increased asset allocation by asset managers The business will launch an unlisted South African Property Fund.
Australia While debt refinancing and recapitalisation continue to be topical, access to capital is beginning to open up Property fundamentals are starting to stabilise and the general consensus is that the market is at or near the end of the downward cycle We are well positioned in current market conditions to take advantage of opportunities for property and development acquisitions together with the launch of additional funds The business expects to develop Australian full discretionary geared segregated portfolios by the end of 2010 and grow the investment portfolio to the value of approximately A$164 million.
