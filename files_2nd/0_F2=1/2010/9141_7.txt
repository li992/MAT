We have been selling from a smaller number of sites over the past six months than in the previous six-month period and, indeed, a lower number than we would like.
Detailed planning restrictions and negotiations over Section 106 agreements, together with a slow start on some of our sites means that the number of our outlets will not increase meaningfully until the second half of the new financial year.
We therefore expect overall sales for the year to 30 June 2011 to be second-half biased.
Whilst public sector grant funding continues to be an issue, we have seen increasing interest from private investment bodies and financial institutions who are interested in the long-term investment potential of new housing using an intermediate rental model.
We are also working closely with a number of Registered Affordable Housing Providers to optimise our existing land portfolio, which has the benefit of planning permission.
We remain flexible and adaptable to the rapidly changing housing environment and the opportunities that it presents.
