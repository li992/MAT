Directors remuneration report The TSR targets to which pre 2009 10 awards are subject are as follows: Level of match under the relevant Companys TSr ranking v. percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award the FTSE 100 over the three portion of performance Share Matching Award Shares: year performance period Award that vests Investment Shares Below median 0% 0:1 Median 20% 0.4:1 Upper quintile 100% 2:1 Straight-line vesting will occur if the Companys TSR ranking is between median and upper quintile.
For these purposes, the Committee compares the Companys TSR performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE 100 as at the date of grant using a three month average TSR unless the Committee determines that a shorter or longer period is a more appropriate way of ensuring that the condition constitutes a fair measure of the Companys relative TSR performance over the period.
Save for the award made in December 2008, no part of the TSR portion of pre 2009 10 awards vest unless the Companys adjusted EPS grows by at least 10% over the performance period, unless the Committee believes that it is inappropriate to apply this underpin.
All awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The Committee seeks independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR targets are met.
LTIp awards made in December 2009 and for the 2010 11 financial year As reported last year the Committee carried out a detailed review of remuneration policy including the level of awards to be made under the LTIP for the financial year beginning 1 October 2009 and the applicable performance conditions.
Following a consultation exercise with its major shareholders it was decided that i for the short-term, Performance Share award levels should be reduced to 100% of salary from the normal policy grant level of 150% of salary and ii different performance conditions should apply to awards which reflect the Companys aim of generating substantial above market returns to shareholders while also driving financial performance.
Therefore for the award made in December 2009, the performance condition was solely based on relative TSR performance which compares the Companys TSR performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE 250 as at the date of grant as follows: Level of match under Companys TSr ranking v. percentage of Matching Share Award the FTSE 250 over the three performance Share Matching Award Shares: year performance period Award that vests Investment Shares Below median 0% 0:1 Median 20% 0.4:1 Upper quintile 100% 2:1 Straight-line vesting will occur if the Companys TSR ranking is between median and upper quintile.
In addition, irrespective of the Companys TSR performance, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the TSR result is reflective of the Companys underlying financial performance over the relevant period.
When assessing the Companys performance over the relevant period for the purposes of this underpin, the Committee will robustly consider i the Companys net debt position, ii whether profit per pub is at acceptable levels, iii the extent to which there has been a stabilisation of EPS and iv cumulative EBITDA performance.

Therefore, for a second year Performance Share awards to the relevant incumbent executive directors will be at a reduced 100% of salary level compared to the normal policy grant level of 150% of salary.
In addition, the Committee has agreed to introduce share ownership guidelines for the executive directors.

Service contracts The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract of no fixed term under which they are entitled to receive 12 months notice of termination.
