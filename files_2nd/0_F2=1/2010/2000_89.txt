GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE | REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT | 51 Executive Directors contracts The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment: with the maximum payment being 12 months salary.
No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors agreements All Non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as required by the Companys Articles of Association.
