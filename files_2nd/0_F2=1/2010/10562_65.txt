The accrued benefit entitlement for Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
The transfer values for the pension benefits have been calculated on the basis set by the Trustee of the pension scheme.
Members of the pension scheme had the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Andrew Hosty became a Director on 28 July 2010 and therefore the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the beginning of the year is calculated as at that date.
The increase in accrued benefits reflects the five months qualifying service as a Director.
Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty also received a pension allowance, details of which are set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 83.
