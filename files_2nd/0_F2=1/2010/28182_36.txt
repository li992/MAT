Benchmark The Company has a benchmark of the Dow Jones World Technology Index total return, Sterling adjusted against which NAV performance is measured for the purpose of assessing performance fees.
As at 30 April 2010 the Dow Jones World Technology Index was calculated as a market capitalisation based index of 487 technology companies worldwide.
71% of the index weighting is in North America, 8% in Europe and 21% in Asia Pacic.
By market capitalisation 75% is represented by large companies, 22% by mid caps and 3% by smaller companies.
Although the Company has a benchmark, this is neither a target nor an ideal investment strategy.
The purpose of the benchmark is to set a reasonable return for shareholders above which the Investment Manager is entitled to a share of the extra performance it has delivered.
The Company was established with a performance fee benchmark of the FTSE World Index capital return.
This was changed in May 2000 to a composite benchmark and the components of the benchmark were kept under review by the Board.
The Board decided that with effect from 1 May 2006 the benchmark should change to the Dow Jones World Technology Index total return, Sterling adjusted.
This single index as a benchmark should provide shareholders with a more readily available and understandable measure and is also in keeping with those used by the Companys peer group.
Business Risks In delivering longterm returns to shareholders the identication and monitoring of risk is crucial.
In addition to the detailed internal controls set out in the corporate governance report the Board seeks to identify, assess and monitor risks to the business.
These relate primarily to economic uncertainties and its particular sphere of activity of investing in worldwide stock markets.
The appropriateness of the investment mandate and strategy is considered as this may lead to a depressed share price as investors seek alternative investments or low risk strategies.
As the Companys assets comprise mainly of listed equities the principal risks to the performance of the business are market related.
While the portfolio is diversied across a number of stock markets worldwide, the investment mandate is focused on technology and thus the portfolio will be more sensitive to investor sentiment and the commercial acceptance of technological developments than a general investment portfolio.
Technology stocks also have greater relative price volatility and are subject to the risks of developing technologies, competitive pressures and other factors including the acceptance of new technologies and rapid obsolescence.
Many companies in the technology sector are smaller companies and are therefore subject to the risks attendant on investing in smaller capitalisation businesses.
There is significant exposure to the economic cycles of Europe, Asia and the US as these are the major investment markets for technology stocks.
