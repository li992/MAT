in early 2011, we received an order from lockheed Martin for the provision of MT30s, the worlds most powerful gas turbine, together with Kamewa waterjets, to power a further ten Us Navy littoral Combat ships.
This is the largest surface fleet order ever achieved by Rolls-Royce.
We continued to deliver power and propulsion equipment for the UKs new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers.
Merchant We invest in technology that addresses the need for more efficient marine power and propulsion systems.
This is primarily through the Carrier propeller reduction of exhaust gas emissions and improvements in ship design.
The first propeller for the Royal Navys Queen Elizabeth class aircraft Our Bergen gas engines already surpass international Maritime carriers was produced by the marine business during 2010.

This new design improves stability and crew safety, while minimising Future environmental impact.
Our strong profit performance in 2010 was a result of delivery of existing orders combined with continued growth in service related activity.
During 2010, we completed the acquisition of ODiM.
The advanced automated handling solutions ODiM brings to our marine business Although new orders in equipment reduced in 2010, there was some has further extended our capabilities in the range of vessels and recovery in the second half of the year.
