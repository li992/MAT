REGIONAL REVIEW OF 2010 Continental Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA EMEA, the Groups largest region, contributing 43% of the Groups gross pro t for the year, grew revenue by 6.8% 10.1% to 332.2m 2009: 311.1m and gross pro t by 15.3% to 188.7m 2009: 163.7m.
In all countries in the region, market conditions gradually improved as the year progressed.
While headcount was reduced across the region in 2009, we ensured we maintained the platform of businesses, holding spare capacity in the larger more established countries and, as activity levels increased during 2010, some of this spare capacity was utilised.
In the newer and smaller countries, we have continued to invest for growth.
Headcount in the region was 1,572 at the start of the year and increased to 1,831 by the end of December, with the majority of the hiring taking place in the second half of the year.
Headcount levels are still well below the 2,155 at the start of 2009 and, with the bene t of a lower cost base and the increased level of gross pro t, the region recorded a strong recovery in operating pro ts to 22.3m 2009: 1.0m, a conversion rate of 11.8% 2009: 0.6%.
While the general pattern of stabilisation followed by growth is apparent in virtually all countries across the region, the extent and timing of that pattern varied.
The Netherlands was our most challenging market, with year-on-year gross pro t comparisons only beginning to stabilise in the fourth quarter.
In all other countries in the region, we achieved strong gross pro t growth: in France 38% of EMEA up 21% : Germany 13% of EMEA up 17% : Spain 8% of EMEA up 20% : and Italy 9% of EMEA up 29%.
The other 13 countries, representing 32% of the EMEA region, achieved gross pro t growth of 13%, with particularly strong performances in Switzerland and the UAE.
During the year we opened of ces in Bilbao, Padova, and at the beginning of 2011, we opened our third of ce in the Middle East in Doha, Qatar.
