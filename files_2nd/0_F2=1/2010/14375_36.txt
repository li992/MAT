Of this increase, 2% is attributable to underlying growth and 1% is due to favourable currency movements.
In the US, revenue increased by $22m to $1,176m 2%, all of which was due to underlying growth.
The main factors were the continued growth of products launched in the year including VERILAST and VISIONAIRE.
Outside the US, revenue increased by $38m to $1,019m 4%.
This movement is attributable to underlying growth of 2% and favourable foreign currency translation of 2%.
Global knee revenue increased by $45m to $806m 6%, representing underlying revenue growth of 5% and favourable foreign currency translation of 1%.
There has been continued pressure from the challenging environment on higher specification and early intervention hip and knee implant systems.
Nevertheless, our knee franchise and in particular our LEGION Knee Systems delivered strong growth.
This was driven by the FDA clearance to claim that VERILAST bearing technology for knee replacement provides wear performance sufficient for 30 years of actual use under typical conditions and by our VISIONAIRE Patient Matched Instrumentation sets.
Global hip revenue increased by $7m to $688m 1%, all of which was due to favourable foreign currency translation.
In our hip franchise, both our traditional and new products have continued to perform well, led by the R3 Acetabular System.
Sales of BIRMINGHAM HIP Resurfacing Systems have been weaker, but we are confident that our programme of reinforcing the superior clinicaldata with surgeons and patients willbe effective.
Global trauma revenue increased by $20m to $434m 5%, representing underlying revenue growth of 3% and 2% favourable foreign currency translation.
This improvement is attributable to managements actions to provide additional support and training to the sales force.
In Clinical Therapies, EXOGEN Ultrasound Bone Healing System achieved double digit revenue growth for the year.
Our joint fluid therapies franchise continues to perform well despite the increased competitive environment in the US.
Early in 2010 we sold our niche pain management business and terminated our small spine distribution business in Germany, which reduced our Orthopaedics revenue growth by approximately 1%.
