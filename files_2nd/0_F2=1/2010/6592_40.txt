b Increase over the year in accrued pension in excess of inflation to which the Director would have been entitled on leaving service.
c a transfer value represents the present value of accrued benefits.
It does not represent an amount of money which the individual is entitled to receive.
The change in transfer value over the year reflects the additional pension earned and the effect of changes in stock market conditions during the year.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the method and assumptions used to calculate transfer values from the GKN Group pension Scheme.
These assumptions were adopted by the Trustees with effect from april 2MM8 in order to meet the requirements of new transfer value legislation which came into effect on 1 october 2MM8.
Total amounts paid to Directors as supplementary cash allowances and or as payments to defined contribution retirement plans are set out in footnote b to the first table on page 55.
For Sir Kevin Smith and William Seeger, such payments comprise their retirement benefits in full.
