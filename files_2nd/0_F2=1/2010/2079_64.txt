3 Leinster Changes include reclassification of the UG resource below 11 Level due to a change in the proposed mining method and first time inclusion of the Camelot open-pit resource as part of the Leinster OC Inferred Resource.
In addition, the disseminated portion of the open-cut resource has been separated out by ore type.
4 Ravensthorpe was sold on 20 February 2010.
5 Yakabindie Additional drilling has allowed reclassification of part of the resource to the Measured category.

5 Cerro Matoso Reserve life extends five years beyond the assured tenement entitlement.
Additional extension is available but is not certain: the loss of the additional extension has been tested and found to be not economically material.
6 Leinster Reserves increase due to extension of underground mine plan below 11 Level.
