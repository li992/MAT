Asia In Indonesia we continued to develop the full potential of our Natuna Sea and Block A Aceh gas positions with the accelerated development of new fields in Natuna Sea Block A to capture additional gas market demand and with the execution of the Block A Aceh PSC extension.
In Vietnam, while the Chim So development progresses well, we are seeking to ?
- ` grow our presence with work continuing to define the Dua and C Ro ng Do CRD accumulations as well as by undertaking new exploration activities.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 8 Chief Executives Review continued Indonesia During 2010, the Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A sold an overall average of 160 billion British thermal units per day BBtud gross 2009: 153 BBtud from its gas export facility, whilst the non-operated Kakap Block contributed a further 54 BBtud gross 2009: 42 BBtud.
Gross liquids production from the Block A Anoa field averaged 1,758 barrels of oil per day bopd 2009: 1,920 bopd and 2,993 bopd 2009: 3,540 bopd from Kakap.
The Kakap field experienced downtime during the year as a result of change out of the FPSO vessel.
Overall, net production from Indonesia amounted to 11,650 boepd 2009: 11,050 boepd on a working interest basis.
Significant progress continued to be made on the Gajah Baru project which remains on track to deliver first gas on schedule and within budget in October 2011.
Gajah Baru is the first of a number of fields to be developed to supply additional gas to Singapore and to Batam Island, in Indonesia, under three new GSAs signed in 2008 and reported previously.
Fabrication of the wellhead platform was completed and installation successfully achieved to support the start of development drilling in September, with the drilling rig on location during this period.
Three of the first phase of five wells have been drilled, logged and tested with results that exceeded expectations.
Meanwhile fabrication of the central processing platform at Batam continues as planned.
The overall EPCI contract was 75 per cent complete at year-end.
The central processing platform and export pipeline are due to be installed during the second quarter of 2011 and detailed hook-up and commissioning planning is being progressed.
Also on the operated Natuna Sea Block A PSC, accelerated development work on the Pelikan and Naga fields is in progress in order to be able to take on additional GSA market share from 2014.
The project passed through the concept selection gate, front end engineering and design FEED is in progress and final project sanction is expected in 2011.
On the non-operated Block A Aceh, a fully termed extension to the Block A Aceh PSC was executed with the Government of Indonesia and the provincial Government of Aceh on 28 October 2010, with the extended PSC being effective from 1 September 2011.
Sales agreements with the principal buyers of gas from the field have been completed and work continues towards optimising the project prior to the issuing of EPCI tender documents for the processing facilities in 2011.
