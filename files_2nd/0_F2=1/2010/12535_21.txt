Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 20 Key Performance Indicators Premier measures its performance through seven key performance indicators KPIs that are aligned with our strategy of achieving continuous growth in the business.
Three KPIs LTI and RWDC frequency, production and cash flow from operations are linked to the bonus element of the executive directors and managements remuneration.
Change: improvement 2010 2009 deterioration LTI RWDC frequency 1.70 0.55 1.15 Production kboepd 42.8 44.2 1.4 Cash flow from operations $ million 436.0 347.7 88.3 Operating cost per boe $ 13.9 12.2 1.7 Gearing 35.9% 32.5% 3.4% Realised oil price per barrel $ 79.7 66.3 13.4 Realised gas price per mscf $ 6.26 5.18 1.08 Lost time injuries LTI and restricted workday cases RWDC per million man-hours worked.
Gearing is net debt divided by net assets.
Lost time injuries LTI and restricted workday cases RWDC Historically we have consistently out-performed our annual LTI RWDC frequency targets.
In 2010, for the first time in seven years, we under-performed against these targets.
This was largely due to an increased number of relatively minor restricted workday cases many of which were hand injuries.
Premier has since introduced a hands-off loads initiative on all of its contracted drilling rigs that prohibits lifting and rigging crews from handling suspended loads without the use of push-pull sticks or tag lines at all times.
Production Average working interest production for the full-year was 42.8 kboepd 2009: 44.2 kboepd.
This was lower than that achieved in 2009 due to unplanned maintenance requirements on UK North Sea fields in the Balmoral, Scott and Wytch Farm areas and due to some flooding-related downtime at the Zamzama field in Pakistan.
Cash flow from operations Cash flow from operating activities was US$88.3 million higher at US$436.0 million due to higher realised oil and gas prices which were partially offset by lower production.
Operating cost Unit operating costs were US$13.9 boe 2009: US$12.2 boe reflecting higher unit costs in the UK sector as production levels declined.
Realised oil and gas prices Premiers portfolio of crudes was sold at an average of 20 cents premium to Brent and average actual realisations for the year were US$79.7 bbl 2009: US$66.3 bbl.
Realised average gas prices, a significant portion of which tracks oil price movements, were also 21 per cent higher at US$6.26 mscf 2009: US$5.18 mscf.
