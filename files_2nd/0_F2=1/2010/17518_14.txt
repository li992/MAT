Nevertheless South Africas operating profit was 8% lower than the previous year as a result of an 11% drop in sales volumes, mainly as a result of rail infrastructure constraints and production issues that included flooding at open cut operations and industrial action at Southstock.
Operating profit was also adversely affected by the strengthening of the South African rand against the US dollar, partly offset by cost savings achieved through the ramp up of Goedgevonden and the continued transition of the South African coal operations into three large-scale, lower cost, primarily open cut complexes.
Despite the weakness of the Atlantic thermal market, South Africa achieved a higher average export price per tonne by selling a significant portion of export coal into the stronger Asian market, which, combined with an increased proportion of export sales, resulted in a higher average received sales price and partially offset lower volumes and foreign exchange impacts.
