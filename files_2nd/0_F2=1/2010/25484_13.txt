However, a portion thereof 59.6 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
Refer to page 45 for further details Central costs are higher than the prior year mainly due to the appreciation of the Rand against Pounds Sterling.
Central Funding We have a business model of maintaining a central pool of capital with the aim of ensuring that economies of scale with respect to corporate investments, funding and overall management are obtained Various sources of funding are employed, the determination of which depends on the specific financial and strategic requirements the group faces at the time The funds raised are applied towards making acquisitions, funding central services and debt obligations, and purchasing corporate assets and investments not allocated to the five operating divisions.

This exposure is hedged with the equal and opposite impact reflected in losses earnings attributable to minorities The increase in principal transaction income largely reflects the benefit of purchasing the groups debt in the UK and improved return on certain investments held in the South African portfolio The group has increased its portfolio impairments.
