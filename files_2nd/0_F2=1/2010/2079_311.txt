Remuneration Summary Summary of highlights for FY2010 Details in regard to remuneration during the 2010 financial year are provided in the Remuneration Report in section 6 of our Annual Report.
Key highlights include the following: The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the members of the Group Management Committee GMC has been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee, and a number of improvements are proposed to reflect BHP Billitons prevailing portfolio and strategy and to strengthen the alignment of participants with the creation of sustainable shareholder value.
The performance hurdle will continue to be based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR over a five-year performance period, but will also include a component based on TSR relative to a broader market index, an increase in the averaging period for TSR to reduce the impact of any market fluctuations and some vesting for median performance.
The revised LTIP rules are subject to approval at the 2010 Annual General Meetings.
The Remuneration Committee has also reviewed the minimum shareholding requirements for members of the GMC to strengthen alignment with shareholders.
The requirements have been increased to 300 per cent of gross base salary for the Group CEO and 200 per cent of gross base salary for the other GMC members.
The Groups TSR performance under the LTIP over the five years to 30 June 2010 was assessed by the independent adviser to the Remuneration Committee.
This has led to full vesting of these performance shares for participants, including the members of the GMC.
Further details of this performance are provided below in the section headed Link between shareholder wealth and GMC remuneration.
Fees for non-executive Directors are reviewed annually.
It was determined that no increase to fees would apply for FY2010.
Fees for non-executive Directors for FY2011 were reviewed in July August 2010 and benchmarked against peer companies with the assistance of external advisers.
The new fee structure is set out in the Remuneration Report.
