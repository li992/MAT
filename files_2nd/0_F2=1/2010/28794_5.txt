RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 DIRECTORS REPORT 26 The Directors present their Annual Report and Accounts for the Company, covering the year ended 31 March 2010.
STATUS OF COMPANY The Company is registered as a public company and is incorporated in England and Wales.
The Company conducts its affairs so as to qualify for approval as an investment trust for tax purposes, confirmation of which has been received from HM Revenue & Customs for the year ended 31 March 2009.
Approval for the year ended 31 March 2009 is subject to no subsequent enquiry being made under the corporation tax self assessment legislation.
The Directors are of the opinion that, since that date, the Company has conducted its affairs in a manner which will satisfy the conditions for continued approval as an investment trust under Section 842 of the Taxes Act 1988.
The Company is not a close company within the meaning of the Taxes Act 1988.
The Companys subsidiaries are mainly engaged in investment activities and the activities of the Group are principally undertaken in the UK.
DIRECTORS Biographies of the Directors holding office at the date of this report are shown on pages 24 and 25.
Mr Ian Wace resigned as a Director of the Company on 29 March 2010.
Other than this, there were no changes in the Companys directorate during the year ended 31 March 2010.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS After taxation, the Group made a capital gain of 405.8 million, revenue profit of 66.8 million, and a total profit of 472.6 million during the year ended 31 March 2010.
A dividend of 4.0p per 1 ordinary share in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010 31 March 2009: 7.5p, was paid on 1 April 2010.
No further dividend is recommended in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010.
The movements on consolidated capital and revenue reserves are shown in notes 22 and 23 on page 73.
SHARE CAPITAL Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown in note 20 on page 72.
During the year ended 31 March 2010, no ordinary shares were issued and a total of 600,000 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 600,000 were repurchased and cancelled in accordance with the shareholders authority granted on 23 July 2009, as the shares were trading at a significant discount to NAV.
The shares were repurchased at 950p per ordinary share and represented 0.4% of called up share capital.
The existing authority for the repurchase of shares expires on 30 September 2010 and a replacement authority is to be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting, as explained in the Notice and Explanatory Notes on pages 95 to 102.
NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value of one ordinary share at 31 March 2010, was 1,180.1p.
INVESTMENT POLICY The Companys Corporate Objective is: to deliver long-term capital growth, while preserving shareholders capital: to invest without the constraints of a formal benchmark, but to deliver for shareholders increases in capital value in excess of the relevant indices over time.
The Companys Investment Policy is: to invest in a widely diversified, international portfolio across a range of asset classes, both quoted and unquoted: to allocate part of the portfolio to exceptional managers in order to ensure access to the best external talent available.
The Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority require closed-ended investment funds to publish information about the policies that the fund will follow relating to asset allocation, risk diversification and gearing, including maximum exposures.
27 Asset allocation The Board currently intends to continue to allocate the Groups assets predominantly amongst quoted equities, long equity funds, hedge funds, unquoted direct investments, unquoted funds, real assets, absolute return, fixed income, currencies, government securities and money market funds.
There are no restrictions on the relative allocation of assets amongst these classes and the maximum exposure of any single asset class is therefore 100%, subject to the investment trust restrictions incumbent upon the Company, which require that the Companys income from shares and securities must be at least 70% of its total income, thus automatically limiting the allocation of assets to areas such as property.
In addition the Group uses derivatives to hedge various risk exposures and also to increase exposure to movements in individual securities, markets and currencies where desired.
The allocation amongst these asset classes at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2010 is shown on pages 10 and 11.
Risk diversification The Groups investment portfolio is highly diversified by asset class, geography and currency.
Overall exposures in each case are monitored and managed by executive management under the supervision of the Board.
The portfolio is further diversified through the selection of external managers with different mandates.
At 31 March 2010, 17.5% of the quoted portfolio was delegated to external managers, themselves under obligations to maintain appropriate risk diversification.
The names of these external managers who manage segregated investment accounts for the Group are listed on page 14.
The remainder of the quoted portfolio is managed internally by the executive management under the supervision of the Board.
The Groups investments in hedge funds, long equity funds, unquoted funds and certain of the investments in real assets, absolute return, fixed income and money market funds are also externally managed and provide additional diversification.
The Company also complies with the requirements of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
Gearing The Company has maintained structural gearing principally through term loans.
At 31 March 2010, the Sterling equivalent of the indebtedness under the term loans was 290.3 million, against total assets of 2,176.1 million, or 13.3%.
This percentage may fluctuate as permitted under the financial covenants of the facility agreement.
Were it not for these, the maximum indebtedness that the Company is empowered to incur under its Articles of Association is five times its adjusted capital and reserves, as defined.
Since 31 March 2010, the Company has repaid one of the term loans on its scheduled maturity, as described in note 18 on page 70.
Cross holdings The UKLA Listing Rules also require closed-ended investment companies to disclose quarterly all of their investments in other listed closed-ended investment funds which themselves do not have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their total assets in other listed closed-ended investment funds.
RIT Capital Partners plc has made no statement restricting its own investment policies in this manner.
BUSINESS REVIEW The Company invests with the object of achieving long-term capital growth.
An analysis of the investments is contained in the Investment Review on pages 8 to 23.
The Group holds both listed and unlisted investments.
The Chairmans Statement on pages 4 to 7 of this annual report and the Investment Review contain a review of the Groups business in the year to 31 March 2010.
Financial Highlights and Performance Information is set out on page 3, and the portfolio and currency exposure is analysed on pages 10 and 11.
The principal risks are as set out in note 26 on pages 75 to 89 and in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 35 and 36.
The Directors consider that the Key Performance Indicator most relevant to the Group is the MSCI World Index in Sterling, compared with the movement in the Groups net asset value per share, as set out on page 3.
At the present time, the portfolio meets the requirements to enable the shares of the Company to be included as an investment within an Individual Savings Account ISA.

Components of the interests of Lord Rothschild and Nathaniel Rothschild are held by family trusts.
Accordingly, the names of the respective trustees are disclosed under Major Holders of Voting Rights, where any individual trust controls 3% or more of the Companys voting rights, whereas the holdings of the directors themselves are disclosed under Directors Interests.
The change in the disclosed interests of Nathaniel Rothschild during the year arise from reorganisations of Rothschild family trusts as opposed to changes in the number of shares of the Company held by those trusts, or by Nathaniel Rothschild.
Between the end of the year and the date of this Report, there were no changes in the Directors interests.
Requests from the Chairman for permission to deal in the ordinary shares of the Company are considered by the Board of Directors.
Requests from other Directors and employees of the Group are referred to the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, except in the case of small volume transactions requested by those other than Directors and senior executives, which are considered by the Company Secretary.
Except as stated below, under Management and Administration and in note 28 to the financial statements as regards Lord Rothschild and Nathaniel Rothschild, no Director has, or has had during the period under review, any beneficial interest in any contract or arrangement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries within the terms set out in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The Company maintained liability insurance for its Directors and Officers throughout the year.
The process for the appointment and replacement of Directors is set out on page 32.
MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION Details of the current external investment managers who operated segregated accounts for the Company at 31 March 2010 are shown in the Investment Review on page 14.
The investment managers charge fees based on a percentage of the funds under management in the range from 0.5% to 1.5% per annum and, in certain cases, performance fees are charged where the increase in the value of the funds exceeds specified hurdles.
The investment management agreements can be terminated with notice periods of between one and three months.
Apart from the right to receive accrued fees, the investment management agreements do not provide for any other payment on termination.
The performance of each of the investment managers is reviewed regularly by the executive Directors and the Board as a whole.
The terms of the contracts between the Company and those managers are also reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate.
In the opinion of the Directors, the continuing appointment of the investment managers gives the Company access to the expertise of managers who specialise in particular asset classes or geographical areas and is therefore in the best interests of shareholders.
The majority of the remainder of the investment portfolio is managed by the Companys executive management.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The Companys Annual General Meeting will be held on 22 July 2010 at 11.00 am at The Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5ED.
