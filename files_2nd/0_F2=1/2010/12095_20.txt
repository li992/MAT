Petropavlovsk Annual Report 2010 Our Assets Malomir Geology Malomir: in production since August 2010 The Malomir deposit is situated along and above a major thrust zone within the Mongolo-Okhotskiy fold and thrust system and is hosted by upper Palaeozoic meta-sediments, mainly carbonaceous shales, which are affected by low-grade regional metamorphism and locally intense metasomatic alteration mainly silification with associated hydrothermal mineralisation.
Since acquiring the licence, the Group has completed significant Malomir exploration at Malomir that has resulted in the identification of substantial Amur region JORC resources and the discovery of the two new deposits, Quartzitovoye and Ozhidaemoye.
The Malomir and Ozhidaemoye deposits are related to a flat-dipping tectonic Diagonal thrust zone, while the Quartzitovoye deposit is a north-eastern extension of this structure, north of the River Malomir.
Malomir and Ozhidaemoye contain refractory ore amenable for flotation and gold recovery by pressure Blagoveschensk oxidation.
Quartzitovoye contains high grade free milling ore reserves CHINA which are currently being mined and processed.
Reserves and resources Malomir is the Groups first large-scale mine located in the north-east of the Amur region.
The Group anticipates that it will The Ore Reserves at Malomir are based on an updated Mineral become the first building block in a cluster of assets located in Resources estimate that incorporates significant results from in-fill close proximity to each other, which will be developed using the drilling which have been economically optimised by WAI using a gold synergies between these projects.
The Malomir deposit consists of the main extensive ore body also referred to as Malomir Central, and two other The development of the Malomir deposit is in two stages: initial deposits, Quarzitovoye and Ozhidaemoye.
This gives combined smaller facilities to treat non-refractory reserves followed by the Proven and Probable Ore Reserves of 117.0Mt at an average grade commissioning of further bulk tonnage milling and crushing facilities of 1.09g t Au.
This includes 241kt of ore at an average grade of and a flotation circuit to process refractory reserves, producing 2.40g t Au at the stockpiles.

This resulted in lower than expected head grades at the mill concentrate.
The concentrate will be sent to Pokrovskiy where the 5.4g t versus the anticipated 12.2g t. A review of mining works Group is installing a pressure oxidation facility to process and recover allowed the Group to reduce dilution, resulting in mining operations gold from the concentrates.

Despite the lower than expected head grade, the Malomir optimise a schedule for capital expenditure as revenues from the first plant has been operating consistently since being commissioned, stage of production will be used to expand the operation.

Costs in 2010 Total cash costs at Malomir for 2010 were US$473 oz.
Costs were adversely affected by normal, or usual project start-up costs and are expected to decrease during the course of 2011 when the plant should be working at its full capacity.
