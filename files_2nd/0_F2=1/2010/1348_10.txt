This year has been difficult as our main market, non-residential construction, Sunbelts revenues are impacted not only by the volume of activity declined in the recession by c. 16% in the year to 30 April 2010 as in its end markets but also by two other factors: rental penetration illustrated by the calendar year construction data above.
Both of these factors are positive and are therefore Early signs of recovery are beginning to be seen by economic forecasters helping moderate the impact on us of the substantial volume decline with most expecting a reduced rate of decline in non-residential in our end markets.

Beyond the top four, the market in which Sunbelt operates is characterised by a large number of small competitors.
We expect the recession to result in further consolidation of the industry and growth in market share for the larger companies, each of which have stable financial structures and are therefore well positioned for the cycle relative to smaller, less well-funded competitors.
As we suggested last year, a combination of financial constraint and uncertain order books has resulted in contractors, particularly in the US, increasingly choosing the rental option.
The established trend towards increased outsourcing of equipment supply in the US has accelerated through the cycle.
The fragmentation of the US industry, due to a large number of smaller operators, has also been reduced as some of these have gone out of business.

However, we remain realistic in our expectations regarding the level of public expenditure in the medium term due to the pressures on the government budget.
The UK plant and tool market is not well researched but AMA Research Limiteds most recent market survey is shown above.
This chart shows that whilst the rental market has exhibited good long-term growth with a compound annual growth rate of 1.7%, it is inevitably slower growth than the immature rental market in the US.
