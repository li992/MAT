BUSINESS REVIEW Group Key Performance Indicators Johnson Matthey uses a range of key performance indicators KPIs to monitor the groups performance over time in line with the financial objectives and strategy summarised in the previous section.
This year we have slightly refined our KPIs to better reflect the groups current priorities.
These principal KPIs, together with the groups performance against them in 2009 10, are described below: Sales Excluding Precious Metals million 1,886 Monitoring sales provides a measure of the growth of the business.
In measuring the 1,797 2,000 1,750 growth of the group, we focus on sales excluding the value of precious metals because 1,454 1,341 1,500 total revenue can be heavily distorted by year on year fluctuations in precious metal prices.
Not only that, in many cases variations in the value of the precious metal 1,000 contained within our products are passed directly on to our customers.
500 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Underlying Earnings per Share Pence 89.5 89.6 86.4 Underlying earnings per share is the principal measure used by the board to assess the 82.2 90 73.0 overall profitability of the group.
The following items are excluded from underlying 80 70 earnings because they can distort the trend in measuring results: 60 Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of businesses acquired 50 intangibles.
40 30 Major impairment or restructuring charges.
20 Profits and losses on disposal of businesses.
10 0 Major tax items arising from changes in legislation.
2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Return on Invested Capital % 22 In a business as capital intensive as Johnson Mattheys, profitability alone is a poor Target 20 measure of performance: it is possible to generate good operating margins but poor 18 value for shareholders if assets are not used efficiently.
Return on invested capital ROIC 16 is therefore used alongside profit measures to ensure focus upon the efficient use of the groups assets.
ROIC is defined for the group as underlying operating profit divided by 14 average capital employed equity plus net debt.
ROIC for individual divisions is calculated Cost of Capital 12 using average segmental net assets as the denominator.
10 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Capital Expenditure million 203.5 To enable the group to continue to grow, Johnson Matthey invests significant amounts 210 in maintaining and improving our existing plants and in adding new facilities to provide 180 145.0 134.4 additional capacity where necessary.

Annual capital expenditure 120 is measured as the cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets purchased 90 60 during the year.
The ratio of capital expenditure to depreciation gives an indication of 30 the relative level of investment.
0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 8 - Johnson Matthey Gross Research and Development Expenditure million 91.7 Johnson Matthey is fundamentally a technology company.
To maintain our competitive 100 87.6 90 position, we need to keep investing in research and development.
Whilst absolute levels 73.0 80 68.0 62.7 of research and development expenditure do not necessarily indicate how successful we 70 60 are, that success rapidly feeds through to higher sales as lead times in our business can 50 be quite short.

Total GWP is based on our direct and indirect 350 energy usage and CO equivalence which provide a strong platform for monitoring the 2 280 impacts associated with energy use in our operations.
We are working to broaden the 210 scope of our GWP measurement to include all aspects of our business and to consider 140 the beneficial impacts of our products and services.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010 9 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS BUSINESS REVIEW Case Study Environmental Technologies Division ProcessTechnologies, Revolutionary New Catalyst In June 2009 Process Technologies launched Apico, its new patented methanol synthesis catalyst.
Developed in house by our world class scientists, Apico delivers huge value to our customers.
Compared to other methanol synthesis catalysts, Apico has a much faster start up, produces fewer by products, increases methanol production and has a longer catalyst life.
It is therefore a more sustainable product that enables customers to improve their plant efficiency and reduce their impact on the environment.
