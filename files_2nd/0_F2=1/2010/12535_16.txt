Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 12 Chief Executives Review continued EXPLORATION REVIEW Our exploration strategy, first set out in 2009, envisaged the addition of 200 mmboe of net 2P reserves by 2015.
This will be achieved by focusing on geographies and geological themes in which Premier has demonstrable skills and expertise.
These are the exploration of rift basins in Asia, North Sea and North Africa, and onshore frontal fold belt provinces as exemplified by our asset base in Pakistan and certain areas of Indonesia.
Since 2009, reserves and resources amounting to 56 mmboe have been added towards the 200 mmboe target.
With further evaluation and appraisal, we estimate that this could rise to over 100 mmboe of additions.
In 2010, Premier participated in 14 exploration and appraisal wells, of which eight were successful: a success rate of 57 per cent.
The most notable successes in 2010 were the three Catcher discoveries in UK Block 28 9, on the western margin of the Central North Sea rift basin.
These play-opening successes were followed up by the Varadero discovery at the end of the year.
Further wells are planned to test the play in 2011.
In addition to play-opening wells, Premier continues to explore for low risk opportunities adjacent to existing or planned infrastructure, and notable successes were achieved at West Rochelle, near the Scott Telford facilities in the UK, at Kadanwari in Pakistan and Blbaer in Norway.
2 During the year, Premier captured 3,022km of net new acreage 2 in the UK eight licences and 9,445km in Egypt one licence.
Post year-end, two new licences were awarded in Norway.
The Egyptian licence, a frontier play in deeper water, is a step change for Premier, but consistent with our rift basin theme.
The exploration well in water depth of 700m commenced in December 2010 with the results expected in the second quarter of 2011.
New business activity in central and northeast Africa resulted in the commencement of negotiations for two production sharing agreements offshore Kenya Blocks L10A and L10B.
Premier Andrew Lodge will have an average 22.5 per cent interest in these blocks.
Exploration Director Premier continues to acquire high-quality datasets in support 2 of exploration and appraisal drilling and in 2010 1,910km of 3D seismic data were acquired to advance the interpretation in preparation for 2012 drilling in Vietnam and the UK.
20 exploration and appraisal wells are planned for 2011, inclusive of important play tests in Vietnam, Indonesia and Egypt.
