This is despite the negative impact of foreign exchange, with the euro weakening by approximately 4% against sterling during the year.
Private equity funds portfolio 1,054.7 million 84.5% of the net investment portfolio The private equity funds portfolio is dominated by funds advised by Permira, whichrepresent 95.4% of the private equity funds portfolio and 80.6% of the investment portfolio.
Looking at the Permira funds portfolio, the strong recovery in the operational performance of the underlying portfolio companies in the first half has continued into the second half with the private equity funds portfolio reporting a 40.1% total return over the 12 months.
This is a material improvement on 2009, and has been entirely driven by a significant rebound in portfolio company earnings, especially at some of the larger Permira IV companies.
Like-for-like discounted earnings multiples used to value the portfolio recovered in the second half, but were still marginally down over theyear.
Encouragingly much of the earnings growth reported during 2010 has been supported by top-line growth, with weighted average year-on-year revenues increasing by 14%.
This top-line growth has been enhanced by the extensive cost saving, debt reduction and operational efficiency measures taken by the underlying management teams in 2009 and has translated into a weighted average year-on-year earnings growth for the 12 months of 27%.
The Permira funds and the underlying management teams have continued to work on fide-risking the portfolio and strengthening capital structures, and extending debt maturities, where appropriate.
Aggregate debt across the top 20 companies has decreased slightly by 6.0% over the year in constant currencies and at 31December 2010, less than 15% of the Permira funds portfolio company debt wasdue to expire before 2014.
The clear majority of portfolio companies end 2010 with stable capital structures and strong earnings momentum.
As revenues continue to increase, companies should be well placed to use free-cash-flows to further pay down debt going forward.
