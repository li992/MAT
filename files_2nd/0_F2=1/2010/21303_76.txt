CLO assets wrapped by non-investment grade rated monolines and classied as loans and receivables declined to a fair value of 5,873m 2009: 7,994m, following the unwinding of certain protection during the year with a notional of 2,745m.
As a result, there were CLO assets with a fair value of 1,969m at 31st December 2010 2009: nil no longer protected by a monoline insurer.
The remaining assets continue to be measured at fair value through profit and loss.
D. Loan to Protium On 16th September 2009, Barclays Capital sold assets of 7,454m $12,285m, including 5,087m $8,384m in credit market assets, to Protium Finance LP Protium, a newly established fund.
As part of the transaction Barclays extended a $12,641m 10 year loan to Protium.
The table below includes all assets held by Protium as collateral for the loan.
At 31st December 2010, there were assets wrapped by a monoline insurer with a fair value of $4,806m 2009: $4,095m.
Following the commutation of contracts with one monoline insurer in January 2011, there are no longer any assets wrapped by monoline insurers.
Cash and cash equivalents at 31st December 2010 were $1,364m 2009: $688m including cash realised from sales and paydowns and funds available to purchase third party assets.
Other assets at 31st December 2010 were $811m 2009: $567m including residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by Protium post inception and other asset-backed securities.
Principal and interest payments have been received in accordance with contractual terms.
However, following a reassessment of the expected realisation period, the loan is carried at an amount equivalent to the fair value of the underlying collateral.
This has resulted in an impairment charge of $824m 532m.
com annualreport10 115 The loan decreased in local currency between 31st December 2009 and 31st December 2010 primarily due to principal repayments of $993m, the impairment charge of $824m and accrued interest decreases of $26m.
Interest payments of $407m were received during the year.
Barclays continues to conclude that it is appropriate not to consolidate Protium within the Group financial statements.
It should be noted that the Groups results would not be materially different if Protium were to be consolidated.
Fair value disclosures equivalent to those made for Barclays own financial assets have been provided below in respect of Protiums financial assets totalling 7,028m 2009: 7,644m, which are used to collateralise the loan from Barclays.
The analysis below excludes cash and cash equivalents of 881m 2009: 425m that are also used to collateralise the loan.
The valuation techniques that would be used to measure these assets are described on pages 256 to 260.
The valuations have been subject to Barclays valuation control framework, which is described on page 263.

The stresses applied take account of the nature of valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historic data.
In all cases, an assessment is made to determine the suitability of available data.
The sensitivity methodologies that are used to assess the Protium assets are described on pages 261 to 263 and are consistent with that of Barclays valuation control framework.
