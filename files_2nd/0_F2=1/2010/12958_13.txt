Gounkoto mine development Gounkoto is a recent greenfields discovery which is located 22.5 kilometres south of the Loulo gold mine, within the current Loulo Exploitation Permit.
Randgold is currently engaged in the process of applying covered by depositional regolith, with approximately only for the formation of the new Gounkoto Exploitation Permit 6% outcrop.
The host rocks to the Gounkoto mineralisation which is planned to be split from the current Loulo permit, are a sequence of fine grained arkoses which have suffered and which will be owned by a separate company, Socit an early silica carbonate alteration event.

of the sulphide is pyrite with minor arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite and additionally gold tellurides are present.
The Gounkoto mine development Gounkoto is located Mineralisation is bounded by a hangingwall shear and within the Kedougou-Kenieba erosional inlier which is footwall mylonite.
In the hangingwall there is a prominent underlain by Lower Proterozoic Birimian  sequences.
The area is extensively laterised and limestone unit which is used as a marker horizon.

Underground mineral resources are those insitu mineral resources below the US$1 200 oz pit shell reported at 2.0g t cut-off.
Mineral resources were generated by Mr Abdoulaye Ngom, an officer of the company, under the supervision of Mr Jonathan Kleynhans, an officer of the company and competent person.
Open pit mineral reserves are reported at a gold price of US$800 oz and 1.40g t cut-off and include dilution and ore loss factors.
Open pit mineral reserves were calculated by Mr Onno ten Brinke, an officer of the company and competent person.
Attributable gold Moz refers to the quantity attributable to Randgold based on its 80% interest in Gounkoto.

Feasibility study A feasibility study was completed on the open pit mineral reserve.
This assessment does not include the potential of adjacent satellite deposits of P64 and Faraba, or the depth potential of underground mineral resources.
The feasibility is based on a tolltreatment project in terms of which the ore is mined and fed through an onsite fixed crusher at Gounkoto.
The crushed ore will then be loaded onto dedicated haul trucks and transported to the loulo plant.
Infrastructural development will include two diversion dams and a diversion trench to avert the seasonal rain flows from the east.
support facilities will include accommodation, workshops and offices.
The use of the loulo plant to process Gounkoto ore as opposed to building a standalone operation at Gounkoto represents better utilisation of the existing infrastructure and human capital, and has reduced the environmental footprint.
It offers significant synergies with the present open pit mining fleet, which is nearing the completion of open pit mining at loulo, while it also allows for the faster realisation of value from Gounkoto.

The dam and river diversion together with support facilities are planned for completion by midyear.
Project work will continue to develop the underground resources and complete the initial design studies on the underground opportunities.
In addition, a heap leach prefeasibility study is being carried out to potentially process the low grade Gounkoto material and the satellite deposits of Faraba and P64.
Exploration The exploration team at Gounkoto has been solely focused on completing the fast-tracked feasibility study and has succeeded in progressing the field work for the project from first borehole to submitted feasibility document in 26 months.
Work at Gounkoto has included all resource definition drilling on the main orezone and the footwall and hangingwall Work now continues on the exploration for further structures.

During the year a total of 99 kilometres was drilled at the Gounkoto site.
