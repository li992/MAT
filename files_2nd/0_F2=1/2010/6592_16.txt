There was modest growth in the defence sector while large civil aircraft production was down around 6%, as the impact of the recession worked its way through the airline sector.
The division has a balanced position in civil 53% and defence 47% programmes.
US defence spending remained robust apart from the planned reduction in sales of the F-22: production across most programmes such as F-18, F-15, C-130J and C-17 transport aircraft remained stable.
2011 production volumes for the C-17 programme have been reduced from 14 aircraft to 10.
The initial production phase for the Lockheed F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has commenced and although volumes may now be lower in the initial years than originally planned, this aircraft remains a key part of the US defence programme with plans to build in excess of 2,500 aircraft.
Although still to be formally voted into law, the US Defense Department 2011 budget plan shows around 1% growth over the next five years.
In Europe, where GKN has very limited exposure, defence budgets remain under significant pressure and in Asia and the Middle East, a number of significant export programmes are being pursued by GKNs customers.

The requirement to make off highway vehicles more fuel efficient and with lower emissions will provide opportunities for Land Systems to utilise its own expertise and leverage technology from Driveline in making lighter components and increasing the efficiency of power management products.
Furthermore, a strategic review identified a number of potential growth opportunities that could utilise GKNs core skills and technologies.
Examples include military vehicles requiring independent suspension and advanced driveline solutions to cope with more challenging terrain, increasing urbanisation leading to demand for high speed rail solutions and increasing use of renewable energy to meet lower carbon emission targets.
Looking forward to 2011, land systems markets are expected to continue to improve and we expect the division to make further progress in developing stronger positions in existing and new markets.
