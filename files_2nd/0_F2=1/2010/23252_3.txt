Ecofin Water & Power Opportunities pic 09 Report and Accounts 2010 Outlook In April 2010, concerns about the public finances of European countries - particularly Greece - that had been growing for months and which had contributed to high levels of market volatility during the first quarter of calendar 2010, precipitated a crisis in financial markets that led to sharp sell-offs and extreme volatility in currency, equity and commodities markets.
The news flow exacerbated the sell-off as European governments struggled to deal with the crisis before finally agreeing support measures totalling 750 billion in May.
Although markets have recovered somewhat since hitting lows for 2010-to-date in early July, concerns about sovereign debt, the banking system and the outlook for global economic growth in an era of public sector austerity could weigh on equity markets for some time.
In this uncertain environment, utilities are trading on what we believe are very low valuations by historic standards: at levels not seen since the downturn of 2001 2002, when the industry was suffering from overexpansion and other related problems and when many utility balance sheets were stretched.
We believe that depressed utility valuations and the high dividend yields available in the sector combined with the fact that the industry has started to recover from the effects of the recession, together with the fact that the sector's fundamentals are improving makes this a good time to invest in the sector.
As we have said before, in a low growth and low return environment such as the one many observers are forecasting, the utility sector should offer investors good returns over the longer term, when measured on a risk-adjusted and total return basis.
