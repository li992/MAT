During the year, we made real progress in the establishment of a Group Destination Management function, which aims to leverage our Group buying power and standardise customer service in our resorts around the world.
Most signi cantly, the new function will take the lead in coordinating strategy and hotelier negotiations with the Groups key international hotel chains and in our fastest growing destinations of Turkey and Egypt.
Not only is this approach designed to reduce accommodation costs, but to support top line growth by negotiating exclusivity on properties that are in demand from our customers.
In addition, Group Destination Management will streamline the number of incoming agents we work with in each of our key destinations and introduce a single management structure to coordinate in-resort customer service and sales from across most of the Group.
The function will also build a central accommodation content database that our source markets can share.
UNLOCK VALUE THROUGH GREATER GROUPCOORDINATION Market-leading customer service will continue to be at the forefront of everything we do.
Our Group-wide approach to destination management will: create and embed a united as one team overseas culture deliver consistently high standards of customer service in resort capitalise on market strengths and further share bestpractice increase in-resort revenue remove duplication and drive greater ef ciency minimise costs Average Group accommodation costs reduced 120 basis points to 32.5% of sales Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 21 TH017 p16 23. indd TH017 p16 23. indd 21 21 21 12 2010 21 12 2010 22:19 22:19 STRATEGY IN ACTION AIRLINE SYNERGIES REALISING BENEFITS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES Working together, our airlines are achieving signi cant savings by improving fuel ef ciency and consolidating suppliers.
