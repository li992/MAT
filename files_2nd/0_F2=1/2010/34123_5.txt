Online 08 Online innovation and what that means Building on the success of our new website, we have improved our online services, launching innovations which are currently unique to Big Yellow within the UK industry.
We are constantly looking to improve our e-commerce proposition and we will continue to lead the industry in this area.
Check in online Customers can now get a quote, reserve a room and check in online.
Similar to systems in the airline industry, this system has the double benefit of improving the user experience, and reducing move-in time by some 30%, therefore making our operations more efficient.
Online customer reviews Consistent with our strategy of putting the customer at the heart of our business, we have launched an online customer review system which well-known retail brands have made familiar.
This gives us real-time feedback from customers and is published on our website by an independent moderator.
It gives us clear insights as to how we are delivering the experience that our customers demand.
Reviews are not edited or filtered based on the scores they award, and they prove that we are consistently delivering a very high standard of service.
Our customers are our most powerful marketing asset, and this system gives us a digital platform to communicate positive word of mouth to prospective customers.
Search engines and social media Search engines continue to be fundamental to our business, generating 80% of our online prospects.
Our strategy is to engage fully with social media, seeing them as complementary to our existing marketing channels, as opposed to being replacements for them.
Social media will continue to be an important part of our marketing mix, providing us with new ways of engaging with our target audiences and gathering customer feedback.
