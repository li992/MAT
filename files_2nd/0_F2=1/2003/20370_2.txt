COMPANY SUMMARY PERFORMANCE SINCE INCEPTION ON 10 DECEMBER 1990 Absolute Performance Log Scale gures are total returns and have been rebased to 100 at 10 December 1990 BENCHMARK INDEX The Companys performance is measured against the total return on the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index Excluding Investment Companies HGSC XIC.
This comprises the bottom 10% of all UK quoted companies by market value which at 1 January 2004 included some 731 companies, the largest market capitalisation of which was 727 million and the aggregate market capitalisation of which was 107 billion.
RISK The Board believes that the Company has a relatively low risk prole in the context of the investment trust industry.
This belief arises from the fact that the Company has a relatively simple capital structure: invests only in small UK quoted companies: has never been exposed to derivatives and does not intend any such exposure: and outsources all the main operational activities to recognised, well-established rms.
Investment in small companies is generally perceived to carry more risk than investment in large companies.
While this is correct when comparing individual companies, it is much less so when comparing the volatility of returns from diversied portfolios of small and large companies.
The Board believes the Companys portfolio is diversied.
In addition, since the correlation of returns from small and large companies is low, there is an opportunity for investors to reduce risk by holding portfolios of both small and large companies together.
MANAGEMENT FIRM Aberforth Partners are contracted as the investment managers and secretaries to the Company.
Both of these contracts can be terminated by either party at any time by giving six months notice of termination.
Aberforth Partners manage approximately 1.3 billion invested in small UK quoted companies and further information on the rm is set out on page 7.

This equates to an annual fee of approximately 0.8%.
However, the total fee paid each year may be slightly higher or lower than 0.8% depending on movements in the value of the Companys assets during the year.
