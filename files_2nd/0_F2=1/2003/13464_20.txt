COPPER GROUP PROJECTS Resolution Rio Tinto: 55 per cent earn-in The Resolution project is situated in Arizona, US, in the area of the depleted Magma copper mine.
In 2001, an agreement was signed with BHP Billiton Base Metals which allows Rio Tinto to earn a 55 per cent interest in the Resolution project by spending US$25 million over six years.
In 2003, five deep exploration drillholes intersected significant copper mineralisation, indicating a large deposit at depth.
Rio Tinto anticipates earning its 55 per cent interest in the project in early 2004.
The project is currently in the preliminary stages of a pre-feasibility study.
It is anticipated that studies will take some considerable time.
