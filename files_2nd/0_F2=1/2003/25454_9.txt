66 Annual Report 2003 investec in perspective An essential pillar of Investecs operating philosophy is that it does not seek to be all things to all people.
The groups core philosophy has been to build well-defined, value-added businesses focused on serving the needs of select market niches where the group can compete effectively.
Investecs strategic goals and objectives are motivated by the desire to develop an efficient and integrated business on an international scale through the active pursuit of clearly established core competencies in the groups four principal business areas, namely: Private Client Activities Treasury and Specialised Finance Investment Banking Asset Management In addition, Investecs head office provides certain group-wide integrating functions such as Risk Management, Information Technology, Finance, Investor Relations, Marketing, Human Resources and Organisational Development.
It is also responsible for the groups central funding as well as other activities, such as its Property business, Trade Finance and Traded Endowments operations.
The business divisions are effectively managed as autonomous international business segments, enabling them to remain focused on trends and dynamics within their particular industries.
Notwithstanding, as a result of the inter-related nature of their target markets and activities, a degree of interaction takes place between each business to ensure clients benefit from dealing with the broader Investec group.
The groups services are supplemented by a common thrust consisting of the groups culture, mission and philosophies.
This helps the business segments across the jurisdictions to operate as an integrated network.
