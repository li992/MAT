The refinery will enable Rio Tinto Aluminium to add further value to the Weipa bauxite deposit and strengthen both Rio Tinto Aluminiums and Australias positions in the world alumina market.
The majority of the refinerys output will go into Rio Tinto Aluminium smelters.
The balance will be placed in the traded alumina market.

First production is due in the fourth quarter of 2004, with initial shipments in the first quarter of 2005 and full capacity by the end of 2006.

Weipa mine expansion Rio Tinto: 100 per cent A US$150 million expansion of the Weipa bauxite operation was started in 2003 to increase output of beneficiated bauxite to 16.5 million tonnes per year.
The increase in production will help meet the demands of the new Comalco Alumina Refinery.
The majority of the expenditure is on a 9.5 million tonne beneficiation plant to allow mining of lower grade fine ores.
The NeWeipa expansion project is due for completion in 2004.
