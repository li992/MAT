Return on sales has been lifted from 6.1% to 7.7%.

growth in revenues and profits.
We see opportunities to accelerate growth by investment in market extension and in broadening our technical expertise and offering.
Psion Teklogixs initial projects using radio frequency identification RFID and voice recognition indicate that these technologies have the potential to improve productivity dramatically in the logistics industry.
In addition, Psion Teklogix plans to expand its successful solutions business, FOCUS ON SUPPORTING PSION providing middleware and services to enable customers to connect their mobile workforce to their enterprise computing resources.

complementary markets such as field service and the mobile professional worker segment.
The Netbook Pro with Windows CE, aimed at corporate users, was publicly launched in 2003, and many units have been shipped for pilot trials from which feedback is encouraging.
Additionally, there are positive results from a viability study of Netbook with Linux for professional users with specialist applications.
Psion Software After detailed review we concluded that Psion Software and its product, Transcend Mail, needed a new home within a company that had a wider complementary product portfolio and the channels to market appropriate to those products.
The Psion Group had neither the specialist sales and marketing support nor the product investment commitment that would make Transcend Mail a market success.
We disposed of the business to Visto Corporation, securing the employment of the Psion Software team and giving the product its best chance of success.
We wish them the best for the future and hope they succeed in significant sales of the product, from which we will receive royalty payments subject to certain conditions.
Looking Forward The proposed sale of Psions Symbian shareholding will mark another phase in the continuing evolution of Psion.
The Group will now focus on supporting Psion Teklogixs organic growth with investments and prudent acquisitions that accelerate the initiatives described above.
These acquisitions will either add to the existing activities and be justified by the subsequent cost savings and efficiencies that will be available, or they will accelerate the expansion of the business into adjacent markets and technologies.
We are confident that, in time, we will be able to identify some attractive opportunities.
