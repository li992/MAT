Review of the business A review of the Companys operations and its prospects is given in the Chairmans Statement on pages 10 and 11 and in the Investment Managers Report on pages 19 to 22.
Notice of Meeting As a consequence of the Board deciding to put forward to Shareholders additional resolutions in respect of proposals to change the level and basis of the Management fee and to change the Articles of Association of the Company, a Circular is enclosed with the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Therefore, the Notice of Meeting is incorporated in the Circular rather than the Annual Report, as is usually the case.
Principal activity and status The Company is an investment company within the meaning of Part VIII of the Companies Act 1985 and carries on business as an investment trust.

The Inland Revenue will grant Section 842 status, if requested, provided that the Companys affairs have been conducted in such a manner as to satisfy the conditions of that section.
Inland Revenue approval for such status has been given for the year ended 31 December 2002.
Results and dividends The revenue attributable to equity Shareholders for the year amounted to 11,507,000.
Three interim dividends each of 3.45p per share for the year ended 31 December 2003 were paid on 15 August 2003, 17 November 2003 and 16 February 2004.
The Directors now recommend a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2003 of 5.95p per Ordinary share payable on 21 May 2004 to holders of Ordinary shares on the register at close of business on 23 April 2004 making a total distribution to Ordinary Shareholders of 14,081,000, as shown in Note 7.

2 the distribution to B Ordinary Shareholders by way of capitalisation of reserves of 3.8449 B Ordinary shares created as fully paid for every 100 B Ordinary shares held at close of business on 23 April 2004.
This capitalisation issue is in accordance with the dividend provisions of the Articles of Association of the Company and is equivalent in asset value to the final and interim dividends now recommended on the Ordinary shares but excluding any tax credit thereon.
Subject to the approval of Shareholders, definitive certificates in respect of the capitalisation issue will be posted on 21 May 2004.
Applications will be made to the UK Listing Authority for 44,124 B Ordinary shares of 25p each to be admitted to the Official List and to the London Stock Exchange for admission to trading.

The Net Asset Value per Ordinary share at 31 December 2003 was 424.2p 2002 352.8p.
Share Repurchases and Issue of shares In view of the option now available, whereby the Company can purchase its own shares and hold them in Treasury for subsequent resale or cancellation, it is necessary to amend the Articles of Association of the Company to exclude shares held in Treasury from the shares in issue for the purpose of calculating the scrip dividend and to ensure compliance with the Listing Rules.
Consequently details regarding share repurchases and issue of shares are contained in the Circular accompanying this Annual Report, together with the relevant resolutions thereon.
There were no share repurchases during the year ended 31 December 2003.
