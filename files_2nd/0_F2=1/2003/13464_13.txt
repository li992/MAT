b Resources at Weipa have decreased as a result of the application of revised economic parameters permitting development of a new resource model and the subsequent transfer of resources to reserves.
c Coal type: SC steam thermal coal, MC metallurgical coking coal.
d Resources at Bengalla have increased as a result of the development of a revised mine plan.
e Resources at Mount Pleasant have increased as a result of the development of a new resource model which includes additional coal.
f Rio Tinto completed the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kaltim Prima Coal on 10 October 2003. g Measured resources at Colowyo have increased as a result of the reclassification of all reserves outside of the current production area as resources.
h Rio Tinto Coal Australia was previously known as Pacific Coal.
i Resources at Hail Creek have decreased as a result of the transfer of material to reserves and the downgrading of some resources to inventory coal following a review of the Australian Guidelines for Estimating and Reporting of Inventory Coal, Coal Resources and Coal Reserves.
In addition, resources at the Lake Elphinstone deposit, previously included with Hail Creek, are now reported separately.
j Resources at Lake Elphinstone are reported for the first time.
This deposit was previously included as part of the Hail Creek deposit.
k Measured resources at Valeria have increased as a result of the transfer of material from marketable reserves following a revision of economic parameters.
l At Escondida Norte, changes in the mineral resources mainly result from a transfer of material to reserves.
m Resources at Grasberg have increased as a result of changes to cut off grades, revised metallurgical recoveries and the inclusion of a new deposit.
n At Palabora, the sulphide stockpile has been reclassified as a measured resource in order to more accurately meet the requirements of the JORC code.
In addition, Palabora retains the right to purchase copper from the remaining 30.3 million tonnes of stockpiled material that belongs to Foskor.
o Resources at Argyle have decreased following the transfer of material to reserves as a result of the development of a new geological model and revised mine plan.
p The increase in resources at Cortez Pipeline reflects the inclusion of the Cortez Hills and the Hilltop deposits for the first time, and the inclusion of additional resources in adjacent deposits.
q At Kelian, open pit mining ceased in April 2003 and no resources remain.
r At Lihir, resources have changed in order to reflect new calculations.
s Rio Tinto completed the sale of its wholly owned Peak Gold Mine on 17 March 2003. t At Rawhide, mining operations have ceased and processing of stockpiled ore was completed in May 2003.
Reclamation activities are now underway.
u Resources in this category consist of 32 separate deposits, 19 of which are wholly owned by Hamersley Iron.
v Resources at the Iron Ore Company of Canada have decreased as a result of geological re-interpretation, in order to more accurately meet the requirements of the JORC code.
w Comprises resources at QIT-Fer et Titane Rio Tinto 100 per cent and Richards Bay Minerals RBM Rio Tinto 50 per cent.
Resources have decreased following a reassessment of the economics of processing some stockpiled material and the transfer of some material to probable reserves.
x At Rssing the significant increase in resources has resulted from a major change in the planned mining strategy which may result in mine closure when the current pit is mined out.
Material outside of the current final pit has been transferred back to resources from reserves.
