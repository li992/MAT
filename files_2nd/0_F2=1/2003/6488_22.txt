LTIP has two performance criteria: absolute earnings per share growth and growth in comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR based on share price and dividend performance.
The committee believes that these are appropriate measures of the underlying performance of the Company and comparative increase in long term shareholder value.
Under the LTIP, conditional awards of shares and cash are made to executive Directors and senior executives selected at the discretion of the committee.
For executive Directors, the maximum award to be made in any one year is based on 100% of basic salary.
For Management Board members, the maximum award is based on 50% of basic salary, and for other executives 30% of salary.
Awards are made annually and there is a four-year performance period.
No part of an award will be released unless the percentage change in earnings per share of the Company, without taking account of any exceptional profits or losses, equals or exceeds the percentage change in the RPI plus 2% per annum over the performance period.
If this target is met, the TSR of Geest PLC over the performance period compared to that of a peer group of companies in the FTSE food producers sector will determine the percentage of the maximum award to be received by participants.
The peer group for awards made up until 2003 is identified in the table below.
Early in 2004, the committee decided that for awards made from 2004 onwards a more appropriate comparator group would be FTSE 250 companies, excluding investment companies.
This is due to the diminishing number of comparators in the food producers sector.
We notified our major shareholders in advance and received their support.
Table 2 below gives an indication of relative performance under the two measures.
If the Geest PLC TSR ranks at the 50th percentile, 25% of the maximum award will be received, rising on a straight-line basis to the maximum award at the 20th percentile or better ranking.
No part of the award will be received for lower than 50th percentile ranking.
The committee determines whether performance criteria have been met on the basis of data provided by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited.
Subject to meeting the above performance criteria, awards are released to participants in the March following the end of a performance cycle.
Table 1 below shows the performance applicable to cycle 4 awards under the LTIP, which matured on 31 December 2003.
Table 1: Geest PLC: TSR monitoring 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2003 Rank Company TSR % % Rank Rank Company TSR % % Rank 1 Richmond Foods 432% 100% 8 Glanbia ISE 17% 42% 2 Carrs Milling 286% 92% 9 Geest 10% 33% 3 Dairy Crest 70% 83% 10 Greencore Group ISE 5% 25% 4 Northern Foods 50% 75% 11 Tate & Lyle 5% 17% 5 Associated British Foods 38% 67% 12 Cadbury Schweppes 6% 8% 6 Robert Wiseman Dairies 35% 58% 13 Uniq 26% 0% 7 Kerry Group A ISE 18% 50% Source: Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited Table 2 below shows a comparison of the Geest PLC TSR performance against the median achieved by the FTSE 350 Food Producers and Processors group and the FTSE 250 companies, considered to be the most appropriate comparator groups for the purpose of this report, over the period 1999 to 2003 inclusive.

The TSR performance target was not met and so no part of the award was released in March 2004.
Fifth cycle: 2001 to 2004 four years : sixth cycle: 2002 to 2005 four years : seventh cycle: 2003 to 2006 four years : eighth cycle: 2004 to 2007 four years The total annual value of each award at date of award is 100% of salary for executive Directors and 30% of salary for senior executives 50% of salary for Management Board members from cycle 8.
The award consists of shares only for senior executives although executive Directors continue to receive cash and shares.
The maximum number of shares that could be released to executive Directors under awards made in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 is set out in tables 14, 15, 16 and 17 on pages 90 and 91.
Should the maximum award be released, all of the shares and in the case of executive Directors, cash would be released in one tranche in the March following the end of the performance period.
This is not, however, indicative of the final award that would be transferred to participants.
v Other share based incentives The Company has the following share option arrangements.
None of the Directors has share options or is eligible for any.
Table 3: Share based incentives other than COIP and LTIP 3 January 2004 Outstanding share options 1996 Savings related share option sharesave scheme approved by shareholders 8 May 1996 This scheme provides a long term savings and investment opportunity for all employees who have completed six months service at the date of grant.
The options are exercisable after three years at a price not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the time of the grant.
2002 Savings related share options exercisable at a price of 445p in 2005 between 1 December 2005 and 30 May 2006 901,047 2000 Savings related share options exercisable at a price of 419p in 2003 between 1 December 2003 and 30 May 2004 210,432 1996 Company share option scheme approved by shareholders on 8 May 1996 This scheme operates for both UK and overseas executives.
No executive Directors or senior executives who receive LTIP awards are eligible.
Options granted under the scheme may be exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant subject to a performance criterion being satisfied.
This requires the Group to achieve above average comparative TSR measured against the same comparator group as the LTIP as described on page 84 over the three-year performance period.
From 2004 onwards the comparator group will be the FTSE 250 companies, excluding investment companies.
The ordinary shares allotted under the scheme are issued on the same terms as existing ordinary shares at the market price at the date the option was granted.

Accordingly, the number of shares over which options are granted pursuant to the Company share option scheme and the savings related share option scheme is limited, so as to ensure that, in any rolling ten-year period, no more than 10% of the Companys share capital is used, and, of this, that no more than 5% is allocated to the Company share option scheme.
In addition, no more than 5% of the Companys share capital is held under the trusts described below.
Shares for the COIP and LTIP are purchased in the market by the Geest 1996 Employee Benefit Trust.

It is not intended that this trust will purchase further shares.
1996 Employee Benefit Trust established on 26 June 1996 This is a discretionary trust established in Jersey used primarily to purchase shares in Geest PLC to satisfy conditional awards to executive Directors and certain executives under the COIP and LTIP as described on pages 83 to 85.
The Trustees purchase the shares in the market.
On 3 January 2004, 743,065 shares were held by the trust over which conditional awards had been made including awards made to executive Directors under LTIP and COIP as detailed in table 18.
At the period end, the shares held by the trust were subject to a general waiver of all but 0.01 pence per share of the dividend.

Benefits in kind are: company car, fuel, health insurance for the Director and his spouse children under 21 and fully expensed home telephone.
Executive Directors did not receive any short term bonus in March 2003, as the targets, which related to growth in Group profit in 2002, were not met.
The amount of shares received pursuant to the LTIP in 2003 are shown in Table 12 on page 90.
Executive Directors received 25% of their salary in short term bonus in 2004, in respect of performance in 2003 against qualitative targets, related to implementation of strategy and long term performance of the business.
In accordance with the rules of participation of the COIP, this will be invested in shares on their behalf to be the subject of a matching award in 2004.
Performance targets related to growth in Group profit in 2003 were not met, and so this was the total amount of annual short term bonus earned in 2003.
J E Dutton, a former executive Director of the Company left the Company on 31 March 2002.
On his departure it was agreed that he would receive 30,540 shares due to him under LTIP cycle 3 provided certain conditions were met.
Accordingly, these shares were transferred to him on 18 March 2003.
The market value of these shares on that date was 100,782.
I Menzies-Gow left the Company on 27 September 2002, and in accordance with the rules of the LTIP he was entitled to receive 16,993 shares in March 2004 under LTIP cycle 4, subject to performance criteria being met.
Since the criteria were not met he did not receive any shares.
Fees were paid to the following companies in respect of the services of the non-executive Directors: J Banham Westcountry Management R Destin Polaris Management S. P. R. L. R J Davies Arriva plc D W Wallis Rosedene Investments Ltd ii Service contracts Executive Directors All executive Directors have service contracts which expire when the executive attains the age of 60, or may be terminated by the Company earlier for breach by the executive or otherwise by the Company by giving 12 months notice.
Any compensation payment made on termination is subject to mitigation.
88 Geest PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors pay and benefits report continued If termination of the service contract is within two years after a change of control of the Company, the current executive Directors are entitled to a payment equal to two years salary and benets calculated at rates applicable on date of termination, including two years annual short term bonus based on the short term bonus if any paid in respect of the last accounting year.
No mitigation applies to this payment.
Expressly excluded is any payment in respect of awards under the LTIP as all subsisting awards would have been paid out immediately on change of control in accordance with the rules the LTIP rules provide for immediate release of all awards that have vested following the end of a performance period, and a percentage of all other current awards calculated as follows: percentage of performance period that has elapsed at date of change of control times maximum number of shares comprised in award, divided by two.
Performance criteria will be deemed to have been satisfied in full.
Also expressly excluded are any payments under the COIP.
In the event of an amalgamation, take-over, reconstruction or winding-up of the Company, matching awards under COIP become exercisable for a limited period, based on performance up to the event and pro-rated to time.
The enhanced compensation payable in respect of termination following a change of control will not be offered to executive Directors appointed in future and the executive Directors have agreed to relinquish these rights in 2006.
Non-executive Directors All non-executive Directors are appointed on fixed term contracts for up to three years without provision for termination other than for cause.
They are not employees of the Company.
The date and unexpired term of all Directors contracts at the date of this report is set out in the table below: Table 7: Directors contracts Name Date of contract Unexpired term at 18 March 2004 J M Pullen 1 October 1995 Age 60 or 12 months notice J K Scriven 4 July 1991 appointed to the Board 9 January 1996 Age 60 or 12 months notice G J Voyle 8 April 1991 appointed to the Board 1 July 1995 Age 60 or 12 months notice J Banham 1 August 2002 1 year 4 months R J Davies 20 July 1998 3 months # R Destin 1 May 1997 2 years 1 month D W Wallis 1 February 2000 1 year 10 months The executive Directors entered into updated service contracts on 12 December 2002.

A second three-year contract was entered into with David Wallis with effect from 1 February 2003.
Bob Davies intends to stand down as a Director at the Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2004. iii Pension entitlement for executive Directors Executive Directors are entitled to join the Geest Final Pay scheme or the Executive Personal Pension scheme.
The Final Pay scheme has a members contribution rate of 6.25% of pensionable salary.
For executive Directors it provides a pension of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary on retirement at age 60, subject to completion of at least 20 years pensionable service.
For less than 20 years pensionable service, pension rights are accrued at the rate of one thirtieth of basic salary per annum.
In both cases Inland Revenue limits are applied.
The scheme also provides life assurance and pensions for dependants of members on their death in service or following retirement.
Directors who joined the scheme after May 1989 are subject to the earnings cap, so the Company provides these members with a cash supplement for the part of their salary which exceeds the cap.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
Statutory reports Geest PLC 89 Details of executive Directors pensions who are members of the Geest Final Pay Scheme are set out below: Table 8: Pensions Listing Rules disclosure Accumulated Transfer value of Increase in increase in total earned accrued pension accrued pension pension at the in the period in the period end of the period Name J M Pullen 19,117 J K Scriven 2,950 41,250 16,050 G J Voyle 2,660 30,635 13,870 Table 9: Pensions Directors remuneration report regulations 2002 disclosure Increase in transfer value Increase in Transfer value of Transfer value of Directors over the year, Accrued pension at accrued pension accrued pension at accrued pension at contributions net of Directors 3 January 2004 during the year 3 January 2004 28 December 2002 during the year contributions pa pa pa J M Pullen 19,117 521 236,110 191,610 44,500 J K Scriven 41,250 3,990 310,860 232,170 6,160 72,530 G J Voyle 30,635 3,419 230,900 169,610 6,160 55,130 The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid and payable to the individual Director.

No Director had an interest in the plan at 28 December 2002.
Investment shares are the shares purchased by the executive Director with the first 25% of salary earned in short term bonus, net of tax and National Insurance contributions, plus any additional shares purchased for inclusion into this cycle of the COIP.
In respect of this cycle, since the Directors did not receive any of their 2002 short term bonus, in accordance with the COIP rules, the committee permitted them to allocate to the COIP up to 25% of gross salary in shares released under cycle 3 of LTIP.
# Shares subject of match are the number of shares that could have been purchased by the executive Director had the amount applied in acquiring the investment shares been applied without deduction of income tax and National Insurance.
