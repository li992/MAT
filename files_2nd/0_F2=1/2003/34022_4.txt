The adoption of stretching and publicly stated goals has Barclays 131 had a positive impact in Barclays, creating focus and energy which have helped us to deliver strong financial performance during the period.
Peer group 116 average Total Shareholder Return Our primary goal was to achieve top quartile Total Shareholder Return FTSE 100 72 Index TSR on a sustained basis, relative to our peer group.

period as a whole, ranking third out of twelve, with a TSR for the period of 31%.
This compares to a weighted average return for the peer group of 16% and a return of minus 28% for the FTSE 100 market Index.
During the goal period, five members of the peer group had negative TSR.
The remainder of this section provides a summary of our performance against the three supporting goals adopted to drive the primary objective of delivering top quartile TSR: absolute value: economic profit: Cumulative economic profit performance versus goal and costs.

116 and in the FTSE 100 Index would have fallen to 72 during the same period.
Economic profit Back in 1999, we set ourselves the stretching goal of doubling economic profit over the period 2000 to 2003 inclusive, which required us to generate 6.1 billion of cumulative economic profit during the period.
This was the level of economic profit we estimated we would need to assure top quartile TSR performance over the four years.
In 2003, we delivered 1.4 billion of economic profit, 15% higher than in 2002.
This resulted in a cumulative total for the goal period of 5.3 billion, 87% of the goal.
As it happened, the market turndown in 2001 and 2002 lowered the performance bar required to achieve top quartile TSR.
In other words, in 1999 we thought we would need to create compound growth in economic profit of 19% to deliver top quartile TSR.
In fact we generated 13% per annum but that was sufficient to achieve the relative ranking of a top three position among the peer group of twelve organisations.
8 Costs Outlook We made a commitment in 1999, to reduce the annual run rate of costs Our results in 2003 and over the 2000 to 2003 period have shown by 1 billion by the end of 2003.
This goal was designed to deliver an that we can translate strategic goals into financial delivery.
We enter efficient cost base and create a more disciplined cost management 2004 tter and more confident of our ability to continue to improve culture within the Group.
Barclays needed both these things.
We went into 2003 with a cumulative total cost saving of 910 million for 2000 to 2002 inclusive.
In 2003, we captured a further 355 million of cost savings, resulting in a cumulative total for the four-year goal period of 1.26 billion, 26% higher than our goal.
As well as making us John Varley more efficient, the cost savings increased capacity for investment in Group Deputy Chief Executive income generating activities.
In addition to the 1 billion goal, we committed to achieving and sustaining top quartile productivity in all businesses.
We benchmarked each business relative to the external competition to develop an estimated top quartile productivity standard.
The chart below headed cost:income benchmarking shows that four businesses, Barclaycard, Business Banking, Barclays Africa, and Barclays Capital have top quartile cost:income ratios.
Business performance relative to the benchmark is reviewed regularly, and all business leaders have productivity targets as an integral part of their personal performance contracts.
