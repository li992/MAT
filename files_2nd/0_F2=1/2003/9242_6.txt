Mr Smith will be retiring as a director at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.

The Board believes that both directors continue to make a valuable contribution, in particular Mr Morton brings his extensive North American and industrial business experience.
Sir Geoffrey Owens experience in global economic issues and knowledge of industrial and corporate matters provides an important perspective and a useful balance to the Board, it therefore wishes them to continue as directors.

The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities in terms of recruitment, training and career development of all employees, including those with disabilities.
Subsidiaries are encouraged to make all employees aware of the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of their companies.
A copy of the Groups Employment policy statement is available on the Companys website or on request from the Company.
Basis of preparation of the accounts As set out in the statement of directors responsibilities on page 37, the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.
A statement on going concern relating to a business requires judgement at a point in time about future events which by their nature are inherently uncertain.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Supplier payment policy The Group requires its subsidiaries to negotiate clear and satisfactory arrangements for the payment of suppliers, as part of the overall terms and conditions of the supply, and to make payment accordingly.
At the year end there were 55 days of purchases outstanding for the Groups UK subsidiaries.
Auditors It is recommended that Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed as auditors.
Shareholders At 31 December 2003 there were 4,793 shareholders.
Substantial equity interests Pursuant to the requirements of section 198 of the Companies Act 1985, as at 2 March 2004 the Company had received the notifications of beneficial interests of 3% or more in the Companys issued share capital as set out below.
The requirements of section 198 of the Companies Act specify that notifications of holdings of over 3% only have to be made when a full percentage point increase or decrease in the beneficial interest occurs, and that there is no notification requirement in respect of holdings of less than 3% in individual unit trusts even where the aggregation of these holdings amounts to a beneficial interest in excess of 3%.
There is also no notification requirement in respect of discretionary management of shares without a beneficial interest.
However, when the total holding of material and non-material interests exceeds 10% of the Companys issued share capital, there is an obligation of disclosure with respect to the full share holding.
