8 The vaccine market How can you compete in the vaccines market?
The five largest vaccine businesses dominate the market today, but Acambis is targeting a series of significant opportunities to establish itself as a major player in the worldwide vaccines industry.
US STATES AFFECTED BY WEST NILE IN 1999 US STATES AFFECTED BY WEST NILE IN 2003 West Nile First identified in 1937, West Nile, before 1999, had only appeared sporadically in areas of the Middle East, Africa, Russia and southern Europe.
In 1999, it arrived in New York and caused 62 diagnosed cases and seven deaths.
That year, Acambis started a project to develop a vaccine against West Nile virus.
By the end of 2003, the total case count in the US was over 13,500 and more than 500 people had died.
The virus had also spread to Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean.
Acambis foresight meant that, in 2003, it became the first company to start human clinical trials of a potential vaccine to protect against West Nile.
