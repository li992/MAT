The Private Banking division continued its creditable performance, with operating profit before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items increasing 28.9% to 34.6 million.
All of the groups Private Banking operations contributed to this solid performance.
The variance in the operating profit over the period can be explained as follows: Net interest income dropped slightly, notwithstanding a healthy growth in advances of 51.4%.
This was largely due to the depreciation of the Rand Pound Sterling average exchange rate masking the underlying growth in South Africa.
82 Annual Report 2003 The solid growth in net fees and commissions receivable is attributable to increased lending turnover in all operations.
Furthermore, the division continued to benefit from its diverse nature of activities, with structured lending fees, advisory fees, transactional banking fees and retail foreign exchange income experiencing strong growth over the period.
Dealing profits were positively influenced by the increase in value of certain investments held by the division, which have arisen out of the provision of investment banking services to private clients.
The activities of the Private Client Investment Banking division are positioned well below the radar screen of the traditional corporate finance and private equity houses, and focus on the active wealthy entrepreneur.
Furthermore, the division is well equipped to offer small to medium size businesses the service of partnering their personal and business requirements by providing advisory services and asset acquisition.
As a result, the division took certain equity positions in the businesses of these private clients.
The equity exposures are within the groups risk parameters and are monitored regularly.
Administrative expenses grew, largely as a result of a 13.3% increase in headcount over the period and an increase in incentive-based remuneration in line with solid growth in profitability.
Developments Key business developments over the past year are outlined below.
South Africa The Private Bank in South Africa posted a commendable performance as a result of its integrated approach to wealth creation and wealth management.
Since March 2002, the private client lending book grew by 24.6% in Rand terms to R17.2 billion 2002: R13.8 billion.
In difficult and volatile investment markets, rigorous investment management processes and comprehensive infrastructure protected client portfolios and maintained assets under administration.
In transactional banking, critical mass was created, with a substantial increase in the number and usage of account holders.
The Private Bank continues to focus on product innovation: o Launch of Journey card.
o Establishment of Pinion, a private insurance product aimed at private clients facilitating all personal insurance requirements into one policy.
oA strategic enhancement during the financial year was the development of a private client investment banking service, which is aimed at wealthy entrepreneurs and focuses on: - Funding through the provision of debt and equity.
- The creation of specialist investment opportunities for clients wanting to diversify their investment portfolios.
The division was rated the number one private bank for the third consecutive year in the  SA Banking Survey 2002.
Annual Report 2003 83 UK and Europe Performance across all business areas was solid, with particularly good growth from structured property finance specific to the UK market in the form of mezzanine and senior debt.
Since March 2002, the private client lending book grew by 17.0% in Pound Sterling terms to 925 million 2002: 790 million.
Despite a strong bias in the lending book towards commercial and residential property exposures, the book is well secured and the group believes that loan to value ratios of between 60% to 65% are conservative.
In terms of various stress tests applied, a reduction of 30% in property values could result in a naked exposure of approximately 12.2 million.
In line with a detailed strategic review that was undertaken during the period, specialist investment products were introduced as well as the new private client investment banking service.
The division relocated its banking deposit business call centre to South Africa, generating an annual saving of 1.2 million.
As part of the divisions marketing objective, it started to successfully penetrate specific community groups, niches and segments.
The division is building an appropriate business and IT architecture, balancing the investments with the scale of the business to facilitate the delivery of its value proposition.
Australia Client deposits and overall level of advances have increased substantially since the group was granted a banking licence in August 2002.
Since March 2002, the private client lending book grew by 40.7% to A$422 million 2002: A$300 million.
The division continued to enhance its positioning in the investment property finance, wealth advisory and investment management arenas.
Outlook The Private Bank continues its core philosophy of independent best advice.
In an increasingly commoditised environment, it is important for the Private Bank to build a brand with which the concept of advice is clearly associated.
The core strategic focus remains the leveraging of talent pools, products, technology and infrastructure across all geographies, in addition to ongoing product innovation and maintaining a portfolio of businesses.
The introduction of new and enhanced products and additions to existing products should assist penetration into target markets.
South Africa In South Africa, the division has suitably positioned itself in the private banking market through its extensive network and established experience, and expects to continue realising the benefits in this regard.
Product innovation, new client acquisition and growing assets under administration remain a 84 Annual Report 2003 priority.
In the context of a continually increasing demographic shift, black economic empowerment initiatives remain core.
UK and Europe The Private Banking businesses in the UK and Europe are still in a growth phase and vast opportunities exist for future development and increased presence and profitability.
The Investment Management business continues to focus on both a client-centric investment consulting approach and on sourcing strategies that are opportunistic and non-traditional.
The focus for the Trust businesses is on high-end advisory-led services and business development.
The Specialist Lending team will continue to market through professional intermediaries and the Private Client Investment Banking team aims to benefit from investment funding opportunities that arise.
Furthermore, the establishment of a new banking presence in Geneva will enable the development of additional structured products to service targeted clientele.
Australia In Australia, the Private Bank will continue to concentrate on providing quality advice to the high net worth segment, while developing its product and service offering to ensure a balanced portfolio of businesses.

Overview of performance UK GAAP 000 31 March 2003 31 March 2002 Variance % Change Net interest income 5 549 5 880 331 5.6% Net fees and commissions receivable 45 569 58 904 13 335 22.6% Dealing profits 55 608 553 91.0% Other operating income and dividends 50 3 914 3 864 98.7% Admin expenses and depreciation 44 949 53 686 8 737 16.3% Operating profit 6 274 15 620 9 346 59.8% Cost to income ratio % 87.8% 77.5% Private client funds under management millions 8 372 10 122 1 750 17.3% Discretionary 3 045 4 262 1 217 28.6% Non-discretionary 5 327 5 860 533 9.1% Before taxation, amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items.
The Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking division recorded a disappointing performance, with operating profit before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items of 6.3 million, decreasing 59.8% on the previous year.
The division was negatively impacted by lower market prices and reduced demand for equity and related investment products.
Notwithstanding, both Investec Securities Limited in South Africa and Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite CSC in the UK remained profitable throughout the period, albeit at lower levels than in the prior year.
In terms of its strategic review of the US operations, Investec sold its private client retail broking operations to the management of the business at the beginning of the financial period.
Further information is provided on page 12 and 13.
The variance in the operating profit over the period can be explained as follows: Net fees and commissions receivable declined significantly, as the businesses continued to be negatively impacted by the fall off in markets over the past year.
The decline in other operating income can be attributed to the profit made on the disposal of 86 Annual Report 2003 CSCs shareholding in the London Stock Exchange in the prior year around 4 million.
Similar realisations were not repeated in the current year.
Administrative expenses were positively influenced by various cost cutting initiatives as well as a sharp decline in incentive-based remuneration given declining profitability.
The decline in personnel expenses was around 6 million.
South Africa Total funds under management as at 31 March 2003 were R25.6 billion 2002: R27.3 billion, of which R4.5 billion and R21.1 billion were managed on a discretionary and non-discretionary basis, respectively.
The recent strength in the Rand led to diminishing Rand values of the asset swap portion of portfolios.
The division was able to supplement its revenue stream through a number of new investment initiatives.
UK and Europe Funds under management fell from 6 billion as at 31 March 2002 to 4.7 billion as at 31 March 2003 on the back of declining market indices.
Of the 4.7 billion, 2.9 billion and 1.8 billion were managed on a discretionary and non-discretionary basis, respectively.
Net new funds under management of 376 million were recorded for the period under review.
While more than half of the new funds emanated from private clients and trusts, the initiatives on the charities side continued to be beneficial, with the business winning charity portfolio management mandates to the value of more than 100 million.
At 31 March 2003, CSC administered some 560 million of personal equity plan and individual savings account funds for third parties.
Prior to financial year-end, and yet to be reflected in the funds under management, CSC was appointed by the Lord Chancellors Department as one of two Panel Private Client Fund Managers to act on behalf of the Public Guardianship Office, the Court Funds Office and the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee.
Annual Report 2003 87 Outlook The outlook for the groups Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking businesses is dependent on the overall performance of global equity markets.
The group will continue to investigate opportunities to enhance its competitive positioning and profitability and will seek to expand its Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking businesses through select acquisitions.
South Africa Investec Securities Limited is focusing on identifying ways of diversifying its brokerage income stream by introducing alternative product offerings and leveraging off group services that are appropriate for clients.
The conversion of client portfolios into fee paying, fully managed accounts is an ongoing objective, designed to increase annuity revenues.
Furthermore, the business continues to rationalise costs wherever possible, while still investing for the future by building systems to improve efficiencies and profitability.
UK and Europe CSC intends to grow funds under management by maintaining high levels of service and professional performance, supplemented by relatively low-cost marketing efforts.
The strategic focus looking forward will be directed to: Concentrating on core activities where the division has critical mass.
Attracting appropriate high net worth clients.
Further developing the smaller charities niche market.
Resuming the push of investment related services.
Accelerating the collectivisation of smaller portfolios.
While CSCs business model and mix enable the business to be better equipped than most to cope with periods of low volumes and revenues, it would not be immune to the effects of a prolonged severe downturn.
