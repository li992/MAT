DIAMOND PROJECT Murowa Rio Tinto: 78 per cent Rio Tinto and Rio Tinto Zimbabwe propose to approve expenditure of US$10 million on a small scale plant to start diamond production at Murowa near Zvishavane in southern Zimbabwe in 2004.
An updated feasibility study confirmed the existence of three kimberlite pipes representing a mining reserve of 18.7 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.9 carats per tonne.
Initial operations will focus on 1.3 million tonnes of weathered material containing 140,000 tonnes of enriched ore which will be mined first.
The small scale approach reduces the initial investment required and will allow confirmation of marketing and regulatory arrangements prior to expansion, which could be considered within three years.
Diamonds from Murowa will be marketed through Rio Tinto Diamonds in Antwerp.
Safeguards are in place regarding chain of custody of the product.
Zimbabwe is a signatory of the Kimberley Process.
The development affirms a long standing commitment to Zimbabwe and will make a small contribution towards the economic development of the country.
