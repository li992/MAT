Polythene wrapping is collected for recycling and arrangements have been set up for salvageable cardboard tubes to be recycled via the existing logistics operation where possible.
Production of non-hazardous waste has been curtailed significantly over the past six months, reducing the volume sent to landfill.
9 Financial instruments The Company uses a limited number of financial instruments to manage the financial risks faced by the Company comprising cash, short-term deposits, bank overdrafts and various items such as trade debtors and creditors which arise directly from operations.
The main financial risks faced by the Company are those of interest rate, exchange rate and liquidity.
Foreign exchange risk is minimised by a purchasing goods for resale in sterling and b utilising the European cash flows to settle the euro loan repayments.
In respect of interest rate risk, the Companys policy is to place surplus cash at commercial rates on treasury deposit with its bankers, to the extent that the cash flow can be reasonably predicted.
This policy has not changed during the period and is currently under review.
In respect of liquidity risk, the Company finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through overdraft facilities.

Carpetright plc Directors report continued Annual report and 22 accounts 2003 11 Purchase and cancellation of Ordinary shares At the 2002 Annual General Meeting shareholders gave the Company renewed authority to purchase a maximum of 7,514,832 shares of 1p each.
During the year under review, the Company purchased for cancellation 1,580,000 Ordinary shares of 1p each under the authority 2002: 847,678 representing 2.1% of the called up share capital for consideration of 9.3 million.
The purchase by the Company of its own shares demonstrates the Companys continued commitment to ensuring that its balance sheet is managed in the long-term interests of the shareholders.
A resolution seeking renewal of the authority will be put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
12 Annual General Meeting In addition to resolutions to adopt the accounts, declare a final dividend, approve the Directors remuneration report, re-elect Directors and reappoint the auditors, three further resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The first is to give the Directors general power to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 245,277 equal to approximately 33.3% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority which will lapse at the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
The second is to disapply the statutory rights of pre-emption contained in section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to rights issues and issues for cash not exceeding 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors consider it desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power which will terminate at the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
The third resolution will renew an existing authority which gives the Company power to purchase its own shares within limits as to number of shares and price.
The Directors will only exercise the authority if they are satisfied that any purchase will increase the earnings per share of the Ordinary share capital in issue and will be in the interests of the shareholders.
Options over 230,650 Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company were outstanding as at 26 June 2003 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report representing 0.31% of the issued share capital of the Company as at that date.
If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for which they are seeking authority under the proposed resolution, the options outstanding as at 26 June 2003 would represent 0.35% of the Ordinary share capital in issue following such exercise.
13 Auditors KPMG Audit plc have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company and, in accordance with section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing their re-appointment will be put to the members at the Annual General Meeting.
