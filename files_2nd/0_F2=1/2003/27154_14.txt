Directors Report The Directors submit their annual report together with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2003.
Results and dividends The revenue attributable to equity Shareholders for the year amounted to 13,121,000.
The first and second interim dividends of 4.25p per Ordinary share each were paid on 17 January 2003 and 16 April 2003 and the third interim dividend of 4.5p per Ordinary share was paid on 16 July 2003.
The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 4.75p per Ordinary share payable on 31 October 2003 to holders of Ordinary shares on the register on 3 October 2003 making a total distribution to Ordinary Shareholders of 12,461,000, as shown in Note 6.
A resolution in respect of the final dividend will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The sum of 660,000 has been added to the Companys revenue reserve.
Dividends are paid by means of three interim dividends and a final normally in January, April, July and October.
Further details on dividends are contained in the Chairmans Statement on page 7.
The Net Asset Value per Ordinary share at 30 June 2003 was 433.8p 2002 541.3p.
Share Buy-backs At the Annual General Meeting held on 30 October 2002, Shareholders approved the renewal of the authority permitting the Company to purchase its Ordinary shares in the market.
The Directors wish to renew the authority given by Shareholders at the previous Annual General Meeting.
The principal aim of a share buy-back facility is to enhance Shareholder value by acquiring shares at a discount to Net Asset Value, as and when the Directors consider this to be appropriate.
By utilising the power to purchase shares when they are trading at a discount to Net Asset Value per share, the resulting Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders will increase.
This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so would result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders and if it is in the best interests of Shareholders generally.
Any purchase of shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
Under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the maximum price exclusive of expenses that may be paid on the exercise of this authority must not exceed 105 per cent of the average of the middle market quotations for the shares over the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase.
The minimum price which may be paid will be 25p per share.
Shares which are purchased under this authority will be cancelled.
The purchase of shares by the Company will be made from the realised capital gains reserve of the Company.
The purchase price will normally be paid out of the cash balances held by the Company from time to time.
A special resolution, numbered 10, in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, will be put to Shareholders for their approval to renew the authority to purchase in the market a maximum of 14.99 per cent of shares in issue on 17 September 2003 10,523,798 Ordinary shares.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of passing of the Resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means, in effect, that authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting, or earlier if the authority has been exhausted.
During the year ended 30 June 2003, there were no share buybacks.
Murray Income Trust PLC 21 Directors Report Issue of shares In terms of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, the Directors may not allot unissued shares unless so authorised by the Companys Shareholders.
11 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting will, if approved by Shareholders, give the Directors the necessary authority to allot the unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of 877,568 equivalent to 3,510,272 Ordinary shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued Ordinary share capital as at 17 September 2003.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means, in effect, that authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting.
When shares are to be allotted for cash, Section 89 1 of the Act provides that existing Shareholders normally have pre-emption rights and that the new shares are offered first to such Shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings of Ordinary shares.
However, Shareholders can, by special resolution, authorise the Directors to allot shares otherwise than by a pro rata issue to existing Shareholders.
12 will, if passed, give the Directors power to allot, for cash, equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 877,568 equivalent to 3,510,272 Ordinary shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued Ordinary share capital as at 17 September 2003 as if Section 89 1 does not apply.
This is the same amount of share capital that the Directors are seeking the authority to allot pursuant to Resolution No.
This authority will also expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months, whichever is the earlier.
This authority will not be used in connection with a rights issue by the Company.
The Directors intend to use the authority given by Resolution No.
12 to allot shares on a non-pre-emptive basis only in circumstances where this will be clearly beneficial to Shareholders.
Issues will, therefore, be made only where shares can be issued at a premium to Net Asset Value of 2.5 per cent or more, which would increase the value of assets underlying each share.
At present, the Companys Ordinary shares are available under the Savings Plans operated by the Aberdeen Group.
In circumstances where the share price of the Company stands at a premium to Net Asset Value of 2.5 per cent or over, it may be advantageous for the Company to issue new shares directly to participants in the Savings Plans, or to other prospective purchasers.
The issue proceeds would be available for investment in line with the Companys investment policy.
No issue of shares will be made which would effectively alter the control of the Company without the prior approval of Shareholders in a General Meeting.
Share Capital The issued Ordinary share capital at 30 June 2003 and 17 September 2003 amounted to 70,205,458 Ordinary shares.
Review of the Business A review of the Companys operations is given in the Chairmans Statement on pages 7 and 8 and in the Investment Managers Review on pages 12 and 14.
PEP and ISA Status The Company intends to manage its affairs so as to be a fully qualifying investment trust for inclusion in a general PEP and also so that the Companys shares will be qualifying investments for the stocks and shares component of an ISA.
