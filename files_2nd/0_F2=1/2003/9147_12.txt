Kingfisher plc Annual Accounts 2003 35 Notes to the accounts continued 33 Pension costs Pension schemes operated and regular pension costs SSAP 24 The Group operates a variety of pension arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes and funded defined contribution schemes.
By far the most significant are the funded defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for the Groups UK employees.
The total pension charge in the profit and loss account of 43.8m 2002: 48.1m includes 3.2m 2002: 3.0m for the UK defined contribution scheme.
A formal actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme the Scheme was carried out by an independent professionally qualified actuary, at 31 March 2002, using the projected unit method of funding.
In this valuation, the assets were taken at their market value of 900m excluding AVCs.
A value was placed on the liabilities by discounting the anticipated future benefits, including allowance where appropriate for future increases in pension and pensionable salaries, using assumptions derived by reference to market conditions as at 31 March 2002.
The principal assumptions adopted for the future were an inflation rate of 3.0% p. a. an investment return on existing assets of 6.6% p. a. an investment return on future contributions of 6.6% p. a. pensionable pay increases of 4.6% p. a. and pension increases of 2.75% p. a.. On this basis, the assets were sufficient to cover over 101% of the Schemes liabilities.
The next valuation will be made on or before 31 March 2005.
The pension cost for this Scheme charged in the profit and loss account of 35.2m 2002: 38.9m is based on the formal actuarial valuation described above, adjusted to reflect market movements since the date of this valuation, and in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Variations against regular cost have been amortised using the straight line method.
The pension cost for the scheme is 3.6m higher than the contributions paid into the scheme by the Group during the year.
The contributions paid into the scheme are in line with the contribution rate as advised by the actuary following the recent valuation.
There are also funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements covering senior executives in France, for which the charge in profit and loss account was 4.8m 2002: 5.4m.
A further 0.6m charge 2002: 0.8m has been reflected in the profit and loss account in respect of other overseas pension arrangements.
FRS 17 disclosures The Accounting Standards Board has announced a deferral of full mandatory adoption of FRS 17 following the notification of intention by the International Accounting Standards Board that it is to review IAS 19, the present international standard for post employment benefits.
Instead the transitional disclosure requirements will continue.
The valuation of the Scheme used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the Groups UK scheme at 31 March 2002 and updated to 1 February 2003 and takes into account the transitional requirements of FRS 17.
The financial assumptions used to calculate estimated Scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2003 2002 Annual percentage rate % % Discount rate 5.5 5.7 Salary escalation 3.9 4.0 Rate of pension increases 2.3 2.4 Price inflation 2.3 2.4 The assets in the Scheme at 1 February 2003 and the expected future rates of return on them were: 2003 2002 millions % millions % Equities 388 8.5 702 8.0 Bonds 288 4.7 143 5.0 Property 7 7.0 Other principally cash 99 3.8 223 4.0 Total market value of assets 782 6.5 1,068 6.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,050 1,228 Deficit in the scheme 268 160 Related deferred tax asset 80 48 Net pension liability 188 112 The assets and liabilities in the Scheme at 1 February 2003 exclude Superdrug and Woolworths which transferred out of the Scheme during 2002 03.

35 Share options The granting of all options is made by the Remuneration Committee, which consists solely of non-executive directors.
Under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Schemes, participants normally receive a bi-annual allocation of options based on their position in the Group.
In granting options, the Remuneration Committee has regard to both individual and Company performance.
The option price is the average market price over a five day period ending on the grant date, without discount.
Prior to April 2002, the option price was the market price on the day the offer was made, without discount.
The options are capable of exercise after at least three years and within 10 years of the date of grant.
The only exceptions are the Phantom Share Options granted on 23 October 1997.
On the exercise of Phantom Options, applicants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of notional shares in the Company.
In total 1,229 executives held various options as at 1 February 2003.
In addition, all permanent employees excluding those receiving Executive Options were granted options over 400 shares subsequently adjusted to reflect the rights issue in both 1997 and 1998, provided that they were employed as at 19 March 1997 and in employment on the date of grant.
These options are within the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under the UK ShareSave Scheme, eligible UK employees can enter into an Inland Revenue approved savings contract for a period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option price is the average market price over three days shortly before an offer to participate, discounted by a maximum of 20%.
Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or five year period.
Exemption from UITF Abstract 17 Revised has been taken for the Scheme.
International ShareSave plans, along the lines of the UK ShareSave Scheme, are available to eligible employees in Ireland, France, Belgium and Hong Kong.
There are 20,061 employees in ShareSave plans, of which 2,612 are in the international plans.

com Following the demerger of Woolworths Group, its employees included in the 20,061 participants mentioned above are entitled to continue their Kingfisher ShareSave options until maturity or disassociation the point at which the common shareholding in Woolworths Group and Kingfisher plc falls below 50%, whichever is earlier.
From this date their options will be exercisable for a six month period.
The Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST is used to satisfy options granted under the UK ShareSave Scheme.
The QUEST subscribes for shares at their market value at the time of subscription funded by the exercise money received from option holders and contributions from Group companies.
During the year, the QUEST subscribed for 995,500 shares for a total consideration of 2.1m.
Dividends on shares held by the QUEST are waived in accordance with the trust deed.
The rules of the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Schemes and ShareSave plans include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
Options to subscribe under the various schemes for ordinary shares of 13.75p, including those noted in directors interests in the Kingfisher Annual Review 2003 on pages 39 to 41, are shown in the table below.
For tax reasons, slightly different adjustments have been applied to options held by French resident employees.
These options are, therefore, disclosed separately.
2 The date from which options are exercisable has changed where performance conditions for exercise have not been met.
The options will become exercisable when the Groups EPS has grown by at least RPI 6% over a three year period.
The options will lapse unexercised if the performance conditions are not met by the fixed lapse date.
The table above includes the options, which will be met by shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP.
The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP The Kingfisher ESOP is a discretionary trust which has been funded by a 128.6m interest free loan from the Company and its subsidiaries to acquire shares in Kingfisher plc.
The ESOP's current shareholding is 37,229,377 shares valued at 71.7m on 1 February 2003.
Dividends on these shares have not been waived.
The cost of running the Trust is included in the profit and loss account.
Where options have been granted with an exercise price below the average purchase price, the difference is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to the earliest exercise date.
In the view of the directors, the shares held by the ESOP are not impaired.
