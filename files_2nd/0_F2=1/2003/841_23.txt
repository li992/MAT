The aggregate book value of the identifiable assets and liabilities was 7.9 million and the aggregate goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 25.8 million.
The acquisition cost of joint ventures and other investments amounted to 16.3 million in 2003 and principally related to investments in public private partnership projects and shares in the company acquired for the purposes of the Performance Share Plan 2002.
Joint ventures and other investments with a carrying value of 11.6 million were disposed of in the year, realising proceeds of 11.7 million.

28 Lease Commitments The current annual commitments payable under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows: Land and Land and Plant and Plant and buildings buildings equipment equipment 2003 2002 2003 2002 million million million million Group: Expiring: In one year or less 1.3 3.0 5.0 3.0 Between two and five years 10.7 13.9 15.0 8.8 Over five years 19.3 5.0 0.1 31.3 21.9 20.1 11.8 Company: Expiring: Over five years 0.4 0.4 29 Contingent Liabilities Guarantees given by the company in respect of borrowings of subsidiaries amounted to 0.2 million as at 31 December 2003 2002: 2.6 million.
The company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds issued, on behalf of group companies, in the normal course of business.
This includes direct and indirect support on a joint and several basis for a performance bond on the Cross Israel Highway Concession for an amount of 83.7 million 2002: 93.3 million.
AMEC has an effective 11 per cent interest in the Cross Israel Highway Concession.
It has provided support on a joint and several basis both directly to an intermediate company and indirectly from the intermediate company to the concession for letters of credit that the concession has procured from external banks.
These letters principally relate to the performance obligations of the concession.
The intermediate company in which AMEC has a one third share has a one third share in the concession and its share of the performance obligations of the concession amounted to 28.8 million as at 31 December 2003 2002: 41.8 million.
The performance obligations of the concession amounted to 86.4 million as at 31 December 2003 2002: 125.4 million.
AMECs share of the concessions obligations may exceed its effective 11 per cent share should any of the other parties fail, a situation, which is not currently envisaged.
One of the letters of credit procured by the concession is a continuous guarantee for an amount of 22.6 million and is renewable annually.
It is not envisaged that the guarantee would exceed this amount over the life of the concession.
The borrowings of joint ventures, consolidated on a gross equity basis, are generally without recourse to AMEC other than for normal performance obligations which are usually given on a several basis.
AMEC has provided guarantees in respect of committed bank facilities granted to certain property joint ventures.
The borrowings drawn against these facilities amounted to 37.0 million at 31 December 2003 2002: 34.0 million, and the current debt service ratios for these joint ventures are all within the agreed levels.
AMEC has a commitment to invest 56.7 million in joint venture projects and further details are provided in note 27.
It has also provided guarantees on certain projects to invest further amounts of up to 9.8 million if the projects do not perform satisfactorily.
No future adverse events, however, are currently envisaged.
In addition, AMEC has provided joint and several guarantees on certain projects for its partners investment commitments.
Guarantees provided directly amounted to 27.0 million as at 31 December 2003, an amount that would be increased by a further 53.3 million if the indirect guarantees on the Cross Israel Highway Concession were included.
All parties on the Cross Israel Highway Concession are forecast to fulfil their investment commitments by the end of April 2004.
The failure of any of AMECs partners, however, is not currently envisaged.
AMEC takes internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal actions or claims for and against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are unlikely to succeed.
AMEC plc Annual Report 2003 73 Amec back WACE 4 1 04 4:38 PM Page 74 Notes to the Accounts continued 29 Contingent Liabilities continued During 1994 and 1995, AMEC Construction Management Inc. ACMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, entered into various contracts with the United States General Services Administration GSA for the construction of courthouses in Missouri and California and for the refurbishment and seismic upgrade of a US Customs House in California.
The total value of these contracts at point of signing was in the order of US$290 million.
Due, inter alia, to unforeseen site conditions, client delays and numerous design and scope changes, ACMI suffered significant cost overruns and submitted substantial recovery claims.
In June 1999, GSA terminated the right of ACMI to complete one contract, which at that stage was 85 per cent complete.
ACMI contested the termination and sued the GSA for recovery of all claims on this contract.
The United States Department of Justice then filed a counterclaim alleging false claims on the GSA contracts and sought to argue that, as a result, ACMI had forfeited its rights to recovery of all claims.
ACMI, upon legal advice, pleaded guilty in December 2000 and November 2001 to two federal felonies and paid two fines totalling approximately US$1.2 million.
AMEC also agreed to introduce additional ethical processes and procedures, both for the North American workforce and for those staff employed by AMEC, whose responsibilities caused them to have regular business contact with AMEC North America and thus, the US Government.
On 20 August 2002, ACMI and AMEC plc, a party to the North American bonding arrangements, were notified, as a consequence of the ACMI non-compliance offences, that they had been debarred from seeking contracts with the US Government with retrospective effect for a 12 month period from 20 February 2002.
AMEC ceased to be debarred on 20 February 2003 and is now able to bid for all US government contracts.
The GSA recently filed a motion for summary judgement seeking an order declaring that ACMI had forfeited its claims on all the projects.
ACMI opposed the motion and oral argument was held in February 2004.
A decision is not expected for at least six months.
AMEC continues to hope that an amicable settlement of all the outstanding issues with the GSA can be secured but there is, at this time, no certainty that such an outcome will be achieved.
30 Pension Arrangements The group operates a number of pension schemes for United Kingdom and overseas employees.
All United Kingdom members are in defined benefit schemes and the majority of overseas employees are in defined contribution schemes.
a SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs Contributions by employees and employers are paid in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and are held separately from the assets of the group in trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the group was 12.8 million 2002: 16.9 million and there is a prepayment of pension costs as at 31 December 2003 of 70.3 million 2002: 59.0 million included within debtors: amounts falling due after one year.
The projected unit valuation method has been used to assess liabilities and future funding rates for the three major schemes which cover approximately 90 per cent of United Kingdom members.
The latest actuarial valuations of these schemes were undertaken as at 31 December 2001 and 1 April 2002.
These showed that the market value of the assets was 1,058.6 million, with the actuarial value of assets being sufficient to cover 114 per cent of the accrued benefits.
The principal assumptions were based upon future investment returns of 5.50 to 6.30 per cent, future pensionable salary increases of 3.70 to 4.75 per cent, future pension increases of 2.50 to 2.70 per cent and valuation rates of interest of 5.50 to 5.60 per cent.
b FRS 17 Retirement benefits The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent valuations of the three major schemes as at 31 December 2001 and 1 April 2002, and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the schemes liabilities under FRS 17, on a projected unit valuation method, are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 Per cent Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 5.4 5.5 6.0 Rate of inflation 2.7 2.3 2.4 Rate of increase in salaries 3.7 3.3 3.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.7 2.3 2.4 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
