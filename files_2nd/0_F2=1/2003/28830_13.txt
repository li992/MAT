The pension benets earned by the executive directors, as members of Group dened benefit schemes, were as follows: Total accrued Transfer value Transfer value Difference in pension at of total accrued of total accrued transfer values Change in 31 December pension at pension at less members accrued 2003 or date 31 December 31 December contributions pension in year of retirement 2003 2002 note 1 Julian Hance note 3, 6, 12 15,168 159,252 1,424,700 1,420,656 4,044 Andy Haste appointed 2 April 2003 note 3, 7, 8, 11 1,239 1,239 8,906 5,194 Directors who left during 2003 Bob Gunn retired 2 April 2003 note 4, 5, 10 31,269 486,155 6,629,406 4,636,595 1,531,158 Notes: 1.
The difference in transfer values reects the difference between the two transfer values calculated using relevant information on the respective dates and is not necessarily the actuarial increase of the underlying pension.
For Bob Gunn the gures are also impacted by movements in exchange rates.
The gures set out in the table above provide information as required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Listing Rules require the change in accrued pension to be shown excluding the effects of ination and the transfer value of this increase.
These gures are shown in the notes below.
The accrued pension gures shown are the annual amounts of members pension payable from normal retirement age.
Increases to pensions when in payment are applied in accordance with the relevant scheme rules or on the same discretionary basis as applies to the membership of the relevant scheme as a whole.
On the death of the member leaving a surviving spouse and or children, spouses and or childrens pensions are payable in accordance with scheme rules.
Bob Gunn is a member of a Canadian pension scheme whose benets are denominated in Canadian dollars.
The gures shown in sterling have been calculated by taking the appropriate Canadian gure and converting this into sterling at the exchange rate at 31 December 2003 or 31 December 2002 as applicable.
For Bob Gunn the increase in his accrued pension during the year, excluding the effects of ination, was 18,532 pa.
The increase in his early retirement pension, excluding the effects of ination, was 55,942 and the transfer value in respect of this was 762,848 at 31 December 2003.
For Julian Hance the increase in his accrued pension during the year, excluding the effects of ination, was 11,133 pa and the transfer value in respect of this was 99,250 at 31 December 2003.
As Andy Haste joined on 2 April 2003, ination on previously accrued benets does not arise and the increase in his accrued pension excluding the effects of ination and the transfer value thereof are the same as stated in the table above.
Andy Haste is required to contribute to the scheme.
Messrs Gunn and Hance are not required to contribute to the schemes and, with the exception of Bob Gunn, they all have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions AVCs.
Neither the voluntary contribution nor the resulting benets are included in the table.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the UK Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
Following the appointment of Andy Haste as Group Chief Executive on 2 April 2003, Bob Gunn stepped down from the Board and retired from the Group on 30 September 2003 at which date, under the rules of the schemes, he would have been entitled to an early retirement pension of 448,097 pa but he was granted a pension of 486,155 pa shown in the table above.
Of the transfer value shown in the table 518,969 relates to the additional early retirement pension he was granted over the early retirement pension ordinarily available.
Between his retirement date and 31 December 2003, he received pension payments amounting to 81,026, of which 6,343 relates to the additional early retirement pension he was granted.
The transfer values shown at 31 December 2003 and the increases in transfer values do not include these payments.
The benets shown above in respect of Andy Haste relate to his membership of a dened benefit pension scheme up to the earnings cap.
Julian Hance is due to leave the Company in April 2004.
At that time, and based on his current pensionable remuneration, he will be entitled to a pension from his normal retirement age 62 of 161,700 pa which is an increase of 2,448 pa over the total accrued pension at 31 December 2003 shown in the table above.
The pension will be revalued between his date of leaving and normal retirement age in accordance with scheme rules.
The pension could commence earlier than normal retirement age, and if so, would normally be subject to an actuarial reduction, but as part of his severance terms, he is to be allowed to take the pension from age 50 without the application of any actuarial reduction.
The transfer value at his date of leaving, allowing the early retirement from age 50 on an unreduced basis, and using the transfer value basis in force at 31 December 2003, is 3,261,600 and the difference between this and the transfer value at 31 December 2003 is 1,836,900.
Of this amount, 1,792,000 relates to the value of being able to take the pension at age 50 on an unreduced basis compared with the value of the pension ordinarily available from normal retirement age.
