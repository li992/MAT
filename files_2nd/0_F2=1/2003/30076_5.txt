Managers Report Chris Turner Fund Manager 5 June 2003 Introduction Pan European property shares had another excellent year relative to European equities in general.
Property values were, on average, steady, earnings rose modestly as did dividends.
On a country basis, the UK produced the best physical property total return plus 10.6% and almost the worst property share total return minus 20.6% a huge 30% discrepancy which I comment on later in my report.
My main investment themes remained unchanged throughout the year.
That is to say I have continued to add to our retail property exposure and to invest in companies in this area with good liquidity and decent sustainable dividend yields.
At the same time I have continued to sell the shares of companies with high gearing and particularly those exposed to office property whatever the dividend yield.
This risk-averse policy has worked reasonably well.
Where I erred was in regional asset allocation.
I left too much money in the UK and failed to go overweight on the Continent.
In particular the Trust had far too little invested in Austrian and Swiss real estate stocks where property shares show positive total returns.
Nevertheless I avoided most of the horror stories, of which there were several.
Stock selection was positive enough to allow the Trust to outperform the benchmark again.
In the City and Docklands rental A birds-eye view of all the commercial and residential values have already fallen over 25%.
Vacancy rates are property in Europe would now show that capital values are over 10% and still climbing.
Empty desks are also evident falling, but only by one or two per cent per annum.
Tenant in many fully occupied buildings.
The office market in the demand is weakening particularly in office markets as the West End is also poor, and the vacancy rate is close to Pan European economies splutter to maintain even modest 10%, but there is still just enough tenant demand to GDP growth.
However, the impact of falling rental values is ensure that the market has some depth to it.
On the being offset by investor demand, which broadened over the outskirts of London, M25 office rental levels are soft after year and has been encouraged by the poverty of income a sharp increase in vacancy rates.
In regional UK markets yields in other asset classes and by the historically low cost the main source of demand is the public sector.
Meanwhile, though average values are Continental city centre office markets seem inexorably to in decline there are still areas of the property market where be following Londons lead.
In Amsterdam, Berlin, occupier demand exceeds supply and values continue to Frankfurt, Madrid, Munich and Stockholm, where rise.
The key in assessing the future trend of capital values significant new speculative office construction occurred in in any particular market is the outlook for tenant demand the last three years, conditions have already worsened relative to current and future supply.
Investor demand sharply with rental values down by between 15% to 20% eventually follows tenant demand not vice-versa.

rates and therefore a slower decrease in rental values Weakness in rental values is most marked in the core and so far.
Gauging the timing and extent of the nadir and suburban areas of the largest cities, and least obvious, as then the recovery in office markets is a crucial question yet, in regional towns.

The optimists believe that rents property value trends in both directions, is currently will soon stabilise at their new lower levels and that winning the award for having the fastest falling rents and demand will recover as soon as GDP growth accelerates.

confidence has been so sharp that private sector I have tried to concentrate the equity investments in the occupiers will only recover their desire to hire more labour shares of those retail property companies that own the very gradually and that while vacancy rates remain at bigger shopping centres, which have monopolies in their historically high levels rental values will continue to drift catchment areas, and on those that concentrate on retail downwards.

I remarked at the start of my statement that the poor performance of UK property shares ran contrary to the Initial yield is a strong factor in the current pricing of strong returns from UK direct property.
There was no global property shares, and tax freedom, or the lack of it, is single outstanding cause of this discrepancy, but rather it the major component of the difference in initial yields.
