com 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP see note 35 which are treated as cancelled.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for the bonus element of the rights issue, which closed in August 2002.
Figures for the prior year have been restated accordingly.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year.
Supplementary earnings per share figures are presented.
These exclude the effects of operating and non operating exceptional items and acquisition goodwill amortisation to allow comparison to the prior year on a comparable basis.
