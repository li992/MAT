Special Business The Notice of Annual General Meeting contains as special business two Special Resolutions, one Extraordinary Resolution and one Ordinary Resolution: i Special Resolution Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights This item, set out as Resolution 9 in the Notice of Meeting, seeks to renew the authority granted at the previous Annual General Meeting for the directors to take advantage of Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
Section 89 of the Act requires that an allotment of shares for cash may not be made unless the shares are first offered to existing shareholders on a pre-emptive basis in accordance with the Act.
Section 95 of the Act permits the directors to disapply these pre-emption requirements and accordingly a Special Resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting which, if passed, will have the effect of granting the directors the power, on similar terms to that granted by the Special Resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting held on 25 April 2003, to allot up to 5 per cent of the present issued ordinary share capital otherwise than in accordance with Section 89 of the Act in addition to any issue by way of rights.
ii Special Resolution Amendment to the Articles of Association This item, set out as Resolution 10 in the Notice of Meeting seeks shareholder authority to increase the level of the directors fees.
The Articles of Association have since 1997 provided that the aggregate fees payable each year to the non-executive directors be limited to 200,000.
The Board recognises that it is likely that further recruitment of high calibre non-executive directors will be desirable.
The current level of fees paid to the nonexecutive directors is at the rate of 170,000 p. a. : increasing the aggregate cap to 400,000 p. a. and authorising the Board to increase this sum annually in line with the UK wage inflation index will provide the Board with the necessary flexibility when recruiting further non-executive directors.
iii Extraordinary Resolution Authority to Purchase Own Shares This item, set out as Resolution 11 in the Notice of Meeting, seeks to renew the authority of the company to make market purchases of up to 29,255,257 ordinary shares 15 per cent of the issued ordinary shares at 31 December 2003 of 5p each at a price not exceeding 5 per cent above the average of the mid-market quotation of the ordinary shares in the five business days preceding such purchase at a price not below 5p per share.
Purchases will only be made on the London Stock Exchange and only in circumstances where they are, in the opinion of the directors, in the best interests of the company and the Group.
Such purchases will be financed out of distributable profits and will only be made in circumstances which, in the opinion of the directors, should result in an improvement in earnings per share.
Subject to these criteria, your directors propose to continue with the programme of purchasing the companys shares.
Any shares purchased under this arrangement will either be cancelled or held in treasury.
