4 The Companys benchmark is the S&P 500 Composite Index in sterling terms.
This is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not track this benchmark and, consequently, there may be some divergence between its performance and that of the Company.
5 Management fees and all other operating expenses including tax relief, where allowable, but excluding interest payments expressed as a percentage of average shareholders funds over the year.
6 If applicable, a performance fee may be payable by the Company.
Full details of the management and performance fees are given on page 25.
7 Actual gearing means total investments expressed as a percentage of ordinary shareholders funds and therefore takes into account the Companys current liquidity and treats holdings in liquidity stocks as cash.
