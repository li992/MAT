Special business at the Annual General Meeting At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting resolutions will be proposed for the following purposes: Resolution 10 is seeking approval of the Remuneration Report which is set out on pages 31 to 39.
Resolution 11 is to grant to the directors limited authority to allot securities in the Company up to an aggregate amount of 18,539,204.
If passed, the resolution will enable the directors to allot a maximum of 370,784,080 ordinary shares which represent one third of the issued ordinary share capital excluding treasury shares as at 30 March 2004.
Save for shares to be issued to satisfy existing legal obligations, the directors have no present intention of exercising the authority which would be conferred by this resolution.
Resolution 12 is to confer on the directors a restricted power to allot or, now that the Company may hold shares as treasury shares as further described below, sell shares for cash without complying with statutory pre-emption rights.
24 10666.01 Pages 22-41 14 04 2004 19:43 Page 25 Report of the directors continued If passed, the disapplication will cover issues and, in the case of treasury shares, sales by way of rights and other issues and or sales up to an aggregate nominal value of 2,780,511 which such amount represents 55,610,220 ordinary shares amounting to approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2003 and also as at 30 March 2004.
In relation to the exercise of this authority, the Company will have regard to the guidelines published by the investment committees of both the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds.
Resolution 13 is to confer authority on the Company to purchase its own shares.
No purchases have been made to the date of this report and there are no outstanding contracts to purchase shares as of this date.
If granted the directors will exercise the authority only if in their judgement it is in the best interests of shareholders generally and where exercise should result in an improvement in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders.
If passed, the resolution will enable the Company to purchase up to 55,617,614 ordinary shares 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 30 March 2004.
The maximum price at which any share may be purchased is the price equal to 5% above the middle market quotations of such share as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of such purchase, exclusive of expenses, and the minimum price at which any share may be purchased is the par value of such share.
Following the amendments introduced with effect from 1 December 2003 by the Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003, the Companies Act 1985 now permits the Company to hold any such bought back shares in treasury, with a view to possible re-issue at a future date, as an alternative to immediately cancelling them as had previously been required by the legislation.
As at 30 March 2004, the Company held no shares in treasury.
If the Company purchases any of its ordinary shares pursuant to resolution 13, the Company may cancel these shares or hold them in treasury.
Such decision will be made by the directors at the time of purchase on the same basis as outlined above.
The number of options for ordinary shares which are outstanding at 30 March 2004, the latest practical date prior to publication of the Annual Report and Accounts, was 108,530,941 9.8% of the present issued ordinary share capital, excluding treasury shares.
If the proposed authority for the Company to purchase its own shares is used in full, the total number of such options will represent 10.3% of the issued ordinary share capital, excluding treasury shares.
That percentage would be 10.8% if the existing authority for the Company to purchase its own shares were to be used in full prior to the Annual General Meeting.
However, the directors have no current intention to make any purchases of own shares under that authority before the Annual General Meeting when that authority lapses.
The authorities sought by resolutions 11, 12 and 13 are to replace the existing authorities which expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and these authorities will lapse at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
Auditors Following a review process, the directors propose that Deloitte & Touche LLP be appointed as auditors to the Company with effect from the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting  LLP having resigned as the Companys auditors with effect from that time.
Deloitte & Touche LLP have expressed their willingness to act as auditors to the Company and accordingly resolutions to appoint them as auditors and to authorise the directors to fix their remuneration will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Special notice of the resolution proposing the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP has been given to the Company as required by the Companies Act 1985.
