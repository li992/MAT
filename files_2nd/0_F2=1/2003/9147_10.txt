CB Hillier Parker has carried out a valuation of such a representative sample as at 31 December 2002 and, based upon the results of these valuations, there have been internal valuations by qualified valuers employed by the Group of the remainder of Chartwell Land's portfolio.
Properties with any element of Group occupancy are valued on an existing use value basis, which does not take account of formal lease arrangements with Group companies or the Groups occupation of the premises.
Properties without Group occupancy are valued on the basis of open market value.
These valuation bases comply with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual.
Representative samples of the properties owned by Castorama, Darty and BUT were valued by Galtier S. A. and Trillard S. A. as at 31 December 2002.
Based on the results of these samples, the remaining properties belonging to these companies were internally valued by the directors.
The basis of valuation is existing use value.
The directors have resolved to incorporate these valuations in the accounts and the resulting revaluation adjustments have been taken to the revaluation reserve.
The revaluations during the year ended 1 February 2003 resulted in a revaluation surplus of 39.3m 2002: 27.9m.
