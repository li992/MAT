qxp 4 5 04 12:48 PM Page 5 MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS OUR PRODUCTS Wolfsons WM8753 is one of the best performing, lowest power dual communications and audio CODECs available.
Introduced in 2003, it delivers significant improvements in integration and has allowed the designers of personal digital assistants PDAs and multi-media phones to create products with a smaller size but that achieve longer battery life without sacrificing sound quality.
This highly innovative product has made possible the kind of highly desirable features that were previously considered uneconomic to implement.
We believe it is just one example of Wolfsons engineering creating real value for the customer.

qxp 4 5 04 12:48 PM Page 6 MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS Wolfson is a leading supplier of mixed-signal audio solutions and occupies a strong position in the expanding multi-media communications market: a market where shipments of multi-media phones alone are expected to exceed 250 million units by 2005.
Some key drivers for high quality portable audio are the integration of MP3 playback for real-time music download, the integration of video streaming and camcorder functionality and games applications.
In the more broadly based portable multi-media appliance market, Wolfsons technology has been the key to increased market penetration.
In addition to mobile phones, Wolfson believes that its target markets of digital still cameras, digital video camcorders, MP3 players and PDAs are all growing very strongly and are collectively expected to exceed 100 million units in 2004.
Each of these products represents a potential opportunity for Wolfsons mixed-signal technology.
We have leveraged our mixed-signal technology to deliver highly differentiated solutions to some of the worlds most demanding customers.
