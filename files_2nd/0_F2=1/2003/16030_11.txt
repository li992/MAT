46 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC The following items are to be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting as items of special business.
Resolution 8: report of remuneration committee In accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, this resolution seeks shareholders approval of the report of the Remuneration Committee set out on pages 39 to 44.
Resolution 9: executive share option scheme 2001 This resolution seeks shareholders approval to amend the rules of the Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 so that options may be granted to executives up to six months from retirement age.
Further details are given in the letter from the chairman to shareholders dated 17 March 2004.
Resolution 10: share matching scheme 2004 This resolution seeks shareholders approval to the proposed Share Matching Scheme which is summarised on page 40 and further details of which are given in the letter from the chairman to shareholders dated 17 March 2004.
Resolution 11: renewal of authority to allot shares Under the Companies Act 1985 the board is not able to allot shares except with the general or specific authority of shareholders.
Resolution 11 renews the boards authority to issue share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of 2,157,802 being the lesser of the companys authorised but unissued share capital and one third of its issued share capital.
This represents 19.02 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the company as at 5 March 2004.
The authority extends until the earlier of the conclusion of the next annual general meeting and the date fifteen months from the passing of this resolution.
The board does not have any present intention of exercising this authority other than for the purposes of the companys employee share option schemes.
The company does not hold any treasury shares at 5 March 2004.
Resolution 12: limited authority to allot shares for cash The Companies Act 1985 provides that, when equity securities are being issued for cash, such securities must first be offered pro rata to existing shareholders unless the board is given power to allot them without regard to that requirement.
Resolution 12 therefore empowers the board to allot for cash, equity securities of a nominal amount not exceeding 567,110 representing 5 per cent of the issued share capital as at 5 March 2004 without first offering such securities to existing ordinary shareholders.
Any issue of shares for cash will, however, still be subject to the requirements of the UK Listing Authority.
Resolution 13: authority to purchase own shares Your directors believe that it is in the best interests of shareholders that the company should have the flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares up to 10 per cent of the issued share capital.
The effect of any such purchases and the cancellation of such shares would be to reduce the number of shares in issue and the directors would only make such purchases after consideration of the effect on earnings per share and the longer term benefits for the company and shareholders generally.
The fact that such authority is being sought should not be taken to imply that shares would be purchased at any particular price or indeed at all.
At 5 March 2004, there were options outstanding over 4,793,791 ordinary shares, representing 4.23 per cent of the companys issued ordinary share capital.
This would rise to 4.7 per cent if the authority being sought to buy back shares were to be exercised in full and all of the repurchased shares were to be cancelled.
AUDITORS On 1 August 2003, Deloitte & Touche, the companys auditors transferred their business to Deloitte & Touche LLP, a limited liability partnership incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000.
The companys consent has been given to treating the appointment of Deloitte & Touche as extending to Deloitte & Touche LLP with effect from 1 August 2003 under the provisions of section 26 5 of the Companies Act 1989.
