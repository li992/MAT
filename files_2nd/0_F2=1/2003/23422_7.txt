Realisations included 23 million from the sale of a number of smaller unlisted investments, 12 million from the partial sale of listed securities, 9 million from private equity funds and 10 million from the refinancing of and redemption of loans by portfolio companies.

The largest of these related to HLF Group where a full provision of 30 million was made against Electras investment.
This provision alone represented a 6% reduction in the net asset value of Electra for the year.
The reason for the provision is complex and arose from a combination of factors.
An attempt was made to list the company in July 2002, which was withdrawn in the light of market conditions.
Subsequent discussions with potential trade buyers and provisions made to reflect pension fund and other liabilities led to an erosion of the equity value of the company.
The provisions against Agricola Group, a business involved in animal feeds and Esporta, an operator of fitness clubs reflected difficult trading conditions in these particular sectors.
