Investment Managers Review Portfolio Analysis Portfolio Analysis In the year to 30 September 2003 Electra's net asset value per share decreased from 764p per share to 760p per share.
The second half of the year saw a strong recovery in performance which offset most of the decline in the first half of the year, when the net asset value fell to 702p.
Over the period the investment portfolio showed a slight reduction in value from 692 million to 680 million as a result of a net disinvestment from the portfolio of 15 million offset by net gains of 3 million.
New investments in the year amounted to 39 million.
This represented a significant reduction from the previous year when 116 million was invested primarily to support existing portfolio companies.
The reduced rate of investment was anticipated and reflected greater stability in the underlying investment portfolio.
The changes in the portfolio were as shown below: Summary of Changes to Overall Portfolio Year ended 30 September 2003 2002 000 000 Opening valuation 691,727 759,891 Investments 39,182 116,421 Realisations 53,803 137,208 Change in valuation 2,505 47,377 Closing valuation 679,611 691,727 The above valuations at 30 September exclude accrued income 2003: 31,619,000: 2002: Despite the economic situation 22,633,000. many of Electras portfolio companies particularly amongst Realisations continued to be impacted by uncertain market conditions the larger holdings have continued throughout the period and total cash proceeds of 54 million compared to to make good progress.... 137 million in the previous year.
However, because of the reduced level of new investment, this lower level of realisation still resulted in a net disinvestment from Electras portfolio during the period of 15 million, only slightly below the previous year.
At 30 September 2003 Electra's investment portfolio comprised direct investments in 82 companies with an aggregate value of 607 million together with investments in 27 private equity funds with an aggregate value of 73 million.
Of the direct portfolio, investments with a value of 86 million were quoted on a recognised stock exchange but were subject to restrictions on sale.
The top ten and top twenty investments accounted for 53% and 71% of the total portfolio respectively.
Geographically, 76% of the total portfolio is in the UK and Europe, 16% in North America, 7% in Asia and 1% in South America.
Outlook The last two years has been a period of economic uncertainty and difficult stock markets.
This has resulted in a relatively high level of support for the existing portfolio and a declining trend of realisations.
Despite the economic situation many of Electras portfolio companies particularly amongst the larger holdings have continued to make good progress in terms of enhancing operating earnings and in the continued repayment of acquisition debt.
Looking forward, there remains considerable scope to increase the value of Electras portfolio companies through both further earnings growth and debt reduction.
It is also the case that the maturity of the portfolio is such that, given reasonable market conditions, considerable cash flow could be generated from the realisation of certain of the portfolio investments.
12 Electra Investment Trust PLC Electra Investment Trust PLC Portfolio Analysis Currently there appear to be signs of stronger economic activity.
Stock markets have risen sharply and the level of mergers and acquisitions, a significant factor in Electras markets, appears to be increasing.
We believe these factors could lead to greater activity amongst financial buyers who over the past four years have been the major purchaser of Electras investments.
In short, market conditions appear to be more favourable for realisations and this fact, together with the maturing profile of the portfolio, could lead to a significant increase in the amount of cash generated from Electras portfolio.
