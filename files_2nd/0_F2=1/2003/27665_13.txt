PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES The Company is the holding company of the Old Mutual group of companies, whose principal activities are life assurance including retirement savings, asset management including unit trusts and portfolio management and services, banking and general insurance.
SHARE CAPITAL The Companys issued share capital at 31 December 2003 was 383,689,581.10 divided into 3,836,895,811 Ordinary Shares of 10p each 2002: 378,250,637.20 divided into 3,782,506,372 Ordinary Shares of 10p each.
During the year ended 31 December 2003, a total of 4,869,439 shares in the Company were issued at an average price of 75p each under the Groups share option schemes and 49,520,000 shares were issued at a price of 74p each on 7 March 2003 under a placing in connection with the payment of an instalment due to the principals of Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd related to the restructuring of the revenue sharing arrangements at that firm.
Authorities from the shareholders for the Company to make market purchases of, and or to purchase pursuant to contingent purchase contracts relating to each of the four African stock exchanges on which the Companys shares are listed, up to an aggregate of 378,253,948 of its own shares were in force at 31 December 2003.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The Chief Executives Statement, the Group Financial Review and the Business Reviews contained in this document include a review of the year and the outlook for the Group.
The Groups profit, appropriations and financial position are shown in the financial statements.
DIVIDEND The directors recommend a final dividend of 3.1p per share for payment on 28 May 2004 to holders of Ordinary Shares on the register at the close of business on 23 April 2004.
If approved at the Annual General Meeting, this dividend will be paid to shareholders on the South African, Malawi and Zimbabwe branch registers and the Namibian section of the UK register in the respective local currencies of those territories, by reference to the relevant exchange rates prevailing on 1 April 2004, as determined by the Company.
The equivalents of the recommended Sterling dividend in these currencies will be announced by the Company on 2 April 2004.
It is expected that payment will be made via dividend access trust mechanisms in each country concerned.
This means that holders of shares on the South African branch register will receive their dividend from a South African domestic entity and will therefore not be subject to the South African tax on foreign dividends in relation to it.
The Boards policy on dividends is to seek to achieve stable returns to shareholders over time, reflecting the Groups long term rate of return and the cash flow requirements of its businesses.
The Board anticipates declaring an interim dividend for the current year in August 2004, for payment in November 2004.
DIRECTORS The Board currently has ten members, consisting of two executive and eight non-executive directors.
All of the current directors except for Mr M J P Marks who was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2004 served throughout the year ended 31 December 2003.
Mr P G Joubert and Mr C M Stuart retired from the Board as non-executive directors on 26 June 2003 and 28 July 2003 respectively, upon reaching their seventieth birthdays.
Mr R C M Laubscher ceased to be an executive director on 8 December 2003 as a consequence of stepping down as Chief Executive of the Companys 52% owned banking subsidiary, Nedcor Limited.

SUBSTANTIAL INTERESTS IN SHARES At 17 March 2004, the following substantial share interests had been declared to the Company in accordance with Part VI of the Companies Act 1985: % of total Name Number of shares issued shares Barclays plc 166,099,058 4.3% Legal & General Investment Management Limited 128,217,673 3.3% Old Mutual Life Assurance Company South Africa Limited 300,000,000 7.8% Public Investment Commissioners of the Republic of South Africa 285,726,184 7.4% 38 | Directors Report DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT MATTERS 1 EMPLOYMENT POLICIES The Groups employment policies are designed to promote a working environment that supports the recruitment and retention of highly effective employees, improves productivity and fosters relationships free of discrimination.
They are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure their appropriateness for the locations within which they apply.
Whilst local employment policies and procedures are developed by each subsidiary company according to its own circumstances, the following key principles of employment are applied consistently throughout the Group: employees are recruited and promoted on the basis of their suitability for the job, without discrimination in terms of race, religion, national origin, colour, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation or disability unrelated to the task at hand.
In South Africa this principle is balanced with the requirement to address issues of employment equity, and the local businesses practices take due account of this: clear goals are established, together with training and feedback on performance, to deliver the Group or business objectives and to provide a satisfying working environment for employees: a working environment is provided that meets the health and safety standards of the Group and local regulations and which allows employees to work to the best of their abilities, free from discrimination and harassment: employee involvement, consultation and communication are managed in various ways, including in-house publications, briefings, roadshows, and internet-based channels: and the efforts of employees in creating the success of the Group are appropriately recognised.
Compensation systems are structured to recognise both the contribution of individuals and the performance of the sector of the business in which they work.
In addition to the above, a consistent set of policies, as the minimum standard of employment practice applicable to all employees throughout the Group, was agreed in 2003.
2 TALENT MANAGEMENT Old Mutual recognises the pivotal role that talent management plays in the delivery of its international strategic ambitions.
The key focus areas in achieving this are: employing high calibre leaders with international experience, who are able to contribute to the shaping and delivery of effective Group strategy as well as delivering regional business goals: establishing a set of core values to which everyone in the Group subscribes: building a strong base of international leadership expertise throughout the Group: building a performance culture in which the leadership owns the strategy, people are accountable for their performance and there is clear alignment between Group, business and individual goals: and ensuring proper implementation of world-class practices in support of talent management.
Engagement of the Top Leadership Group TLG with the twin goals of driving the delivery of their own business objectives and implementing the Groups strategic agenda has continued.
Following the approval by the Board of the Groups strategy, workshops were held with the TLG in each region to promote their understanding of the Group strategy and what was required to implement this within their region.
This understanding was further enhanced through the Top Leadership Forum that was held in South Africa in October 2003.
The Forum brought together the top leadership from throughout the Group for the first time since demutualisation.
The express purpose of the Forum was to identify opportunities for collaboration throughout the Group, and at the same time to recognise the scale and scope of Old Mutuals operations in the three regions.
The work on harvesting synergies highlighted at the Forum continues and is being tracked through the business reporting channels managed by Group Finance.
Several commitments were made as a result of work done at the Forum, including: the development of a set of core values that will apply throughout the Group and that will work in tandem with the values which each of the regional businesses have developed.
Work on defining these Group values is expected to be completed during the first half of 2004, which will be followed by a review of current management practices to ensure that the Group values are implemented throughout the businesses: the introduction of an internship programme to encourage the international management development of individuals with high potential throughout the Group.
The compensation, development, support and performance management policies necessary to underpin international transfers have been reviewed and will be implemented during 2004.
Directors Report | 39 3 DEVELOPMENTS IN EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE The implementation of Human Resources strategy and policy is effected throughout the Group and monitored and reviewed in the various business units.
The Group strives to be an employer of choice wherever it operates and has created centres of excellence in human resource practice in its larger and more established businesses.
These centres of excellence support and assist the development and implementation of world-class practice in the Groups newer and smaller businesses.
Some recent developments and achievements are outlined below.
The Old Mutual Business School in Cape Town, which provides development programmes for leaders and managers throughout the Group, won two coveted international awards in 2003, the Corporate University Exchange award for innovation and excellence the first time this award has been made to a non-American European corporate university and the Corporate University Best in Class award for overall excellence: Old Mutuals HIV AIDS workplace programme in South Africa was ranked in the top ten in the world by the Global Business Initiative and Global Reporting Initiative and contributed to an increase in registered HIV cases, which allowed for improved access to counselling of employees and their families on HIV AIDS-related issues.
The Groups South African businesses continued to play a leading role in that market.
Key initiatives included: both the banking and life assurance businesses took an active role working in employer bodies which finalised proposals to the South African government on the Financial Sector Charter dealing with Black Economic Empowerment and employment equity: employment equity, management transformation and acceptance of cultural diversity was accelerated through cultural diversity programmes and a voluntary early retirement programme.
The above achievements illustrate the impact of the Groups approach to talent management, both in raising its profile as an employer of choice and also in gaining recognition for its contribution to the broader communities within which it operates.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY In most cases suppliers of goods or services to the Group do so under standard terms of contract which lay down terms of payment.
In other cases, specific terms are agreed beforehand.
It is the Groups policy to ensure that the terms of payment are notified in advance and adhered to.
The Company has signed the Better Payment Practice Code, an initiative promoted by the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK to encourage prompt settlement of invoices.
The total outstanding indebtedness of the Company and its service company subsidiary, Old Mutual Business Services Limited to trade creditors at 31 December 2003 amounted to 955,000, corresponding to 16 days payments when averaged over the year then ended.
CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS The Company, its subsidiaries in the UK, and the Old Mutual Bermuda Foundation collectively made charitable donations of 222,000 during 2003 2002: 421,000.
The Group made no EU or other political donations during the year 2002: none.
Details of the Groups wider involvement in charitable support are contained in the Corporate Citizenship section on pages 22 to 27 of this Report.
SOCIAL INVESTMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES A description of the Groups social investment and environmental activities is included in the Corporate Citizenship section on pages 22 to 27 of this Report.
AUDITORS During the year ended 31 December 2003 fees paid by the Group to KPMG Audit Plc and its associates KPMG, the Groups auditors, totalled 4.5 million for statutory audit services, 3.5 million for other audit and assurance services and 2.5 million for tax and other services.
Included in the 4.5 million for statutory audit services was 1.6 million paid to KPMG by Nedcor: a further 1.6 million was paid by Nedcor to Deloitte & Touche in respect of joint audit arrangements.
The Group Audit Committee considered the balance of audit and non-audit remuneration paid to KPMG at its meeting on 17 February 2004 and declared itself satisfied that the non-audit work was awarded on arms length terms and did not compromise the independence of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors to the Company.
KPMG Audit Plc have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company and a resolution proposing their re-appointment will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
