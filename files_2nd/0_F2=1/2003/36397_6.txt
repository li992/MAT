Portfolio Review We capitalised on the strength of the investment market to dispose of 28 properties for 215.6 million in line with their aggregate March 2002 book values The last year was a difficult one for central London property markets.
Across the Capital supply, particularly of office space, outstripped demand with vacancy rates at the end of the period exceeding 11%.
Whilst much of the surplus office accommodation was marketed by tenants, not landlords, the negative effect on rental values has been felt by all, particularly in the City.
Here rental values for Grade A space in some areas have declined by over 25% in the past twelve months and are, we estimate, set to fall further this year.
We will not witness rental stability until general business sentiment improves and companies regain the confidence to expand.
It was against this background that we carried out a strategic review of our portfolio early in the year, from which it was clear that we needed to act decisively on three fronts: 1.
Property Disposals During the year, 215.6 million of investment properties were sold in line with their March 2002 valuation, the majority of which took place in the second half of the year, and we sold the remainder of our trading portfolio.
Management of Income and Voids In the face of rapidly correcting rental values, we regarded it essential that we concluded as many outstanding rent reviews as possible whilst also approaching occupiers to discuss impending lease expiries well in advance.
During the year, 24% of the rent roll has been reviewed, renewed, let or restructured.
3.5 million of net new rents have been added to the rent roll through rent reviews, lease renewals and new lettings, whilst the percentage of rent subject to an expiry during the next 24 months has been reduced by over a third from 23.4% to 14.7%.
At the beginning of the year, our void rate stood at 1.3%.
In the face of challenging letting market conditions, today that figure has moved to 3.0%.
In central London, which contains 95% of our portfolio, voids are only 1.9%, comparing favourably with the rate for the central London market overall of over 11%.
Revisiting our Development Prospects We have potential development sites in London at Bishopsgate, EC2, our head office building in Mortimer Street, W1, Great Portland Street, W1, Titchmor on Mortimer Street, W1, and New Bond Street, W1.
All of these and other opportunities have been considered fully during the year.
We will be submitting new planning applications during the summer for 190 Great Portland Street, and later this year for our Titchmor 16 Annual Report 2003 Portfolio Review site, which will likely provide for the retention of the 1930s Elsley House and Elsley Court.
We are in the design stage of an exciting redevelopment of Bond Street House situated in one of the best retail locations in the Capital at the junction of New Bond Street and Clifford Street, W1.
At two of our sites, redevelopment has been deferred following profitable asset management activities.
First, at our Bishopsgate holdings, we restructured a lease with the principal occupier and the Groups single largest tenant, the Willis Group, extending 93% of the propertys income from 2004 until 2011.
Second, at Hanover Square, W1, following an extension of the leases to Harbottle & Lewis and Abbey National from 2004 to 2013 and 2017, respectively, a redevelopment of the building will not be taken forward.
Valuation The external valuation, carried out by CB Hillier Parker, registered a decline of 91.4 million or 10.5% to 780.0 million.
The West End portfolio fell by 10.1% in the year, although the rate of fall was lower in the second half, whilst the City and Holborn properties fell by 14.1%, primarily in the second six months.
The small portfolio outside London rose by 0.5% during the period.
As we predicted both this time last year and at the Interim stage, the central London market particularly in the City has seen a material correction in values.
The valuation of our central London properties has fallen broadly in line with the declines registered in the Capital and, were it not for our disposals and asset management activities, would have fared less well relatively.
There are two key reasons behind the valuation result: first, weakness in the letting market has undermined rental values by 15.2% in our London portfolio meaning that reversions previously anticipated by the valuers are now less likely to flow through: and, second, empty space is proving more difficult to let, with rents lower and incentives higher than 12 months previously.
The reality of our letting efforts during the year was that the void rate remained at similarly low levels to that at March 2002, and the City and Holborn portfolio remained fully let.
At 31 March 2003, the portfolios value of 780.0 million reflected a net initial yield of 6.3%.
It was broadly rack-rented, with 1.1 million of reversion to come through over the next five years before a number of over-rented leases expire to reduce the income.
The total five year reversionary potential of the portfolio, including voids and properties under refurbishment, was 62.0 million, on a rent roll at the year end of Portfolio Review Annual Report 2003 17 58.5 million.
At the beginning of the year the reversionary potential of the Group stood at 12.5 million.
Since then, 5.1 million has been crystallised through asset management activities and 10.0 million was accounted for by declining rental values, whilst through our sales programme we disposed of properties which were overrented by 1.5 million.
West End and Covent Garden At March 2003, availability in the West End office market stood at just over 9 million sq.
ft. or approximately 11% of the stock, up from around 5% in March 2002.
Take up during 2002 was in line with the long-term average at just under 4 million sq.
ft. but in the last quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003 it was disappointing at 1.7 million sq.
ft. with viewings down on normal market levels.
By far the majority of space to let was second-hand and quoting rents had been reduced significantly to encourage demand.
Although there were pockets of the market where many years supply existed at current demand levels and there will be further downward pressure on rents, we believe that rental levels in the West End have now broadly corrected for good quality space and we are encouraged by the significant level of viewings since the end of hostilities in Iraq.
Today, there is little availability of good new floor plates of Grade A standard in the West End and, indeed, where these become available there is evidence of increasing demand.
Our West End portfolio at 31 March 2003 was valued at 550.6 million, representing 70.5% of the Groups total portfolio.
Of this, 290.1 million was in offices north of Oxford Street, with 121.2 million in offices in the rest of the West End and 136.2 million in West End retail.
Average rents passing for offices north of Oxford Street at 31 March 2003 were 29 per sq.
ft. last year, primarily due to significant rent reviews at 160 Great Portland Street, where the passing rents of 2.2 million were reviewed to 4.0 million, in line with our estimates this time last year.
Average rental values of offices north of Oxford Street fell from 33 per sq.
In the rest of the West End and Covent Garden portfolio office rents passing increased from 35 per sq.
ft. through rent reviews, although office rental values declined from 39 per sq.
ft. Retail rental values in the West End remained stable in the year with continued demand for large format, well-located units.
Average rents passing for our West End retail 18 Annual Report 2003 Portfolio Review properties, excluding those north of Oxford Street, rose from 58 per sq.
ft. following the crystallisation of significant rental reversion at 15 16 New Bond Street, W1.
Significant lease restructurings were entered into at 21 Bloomsbury Street, WC1, 34 43 Russell Street, WC2, 55 Drury Lane, WC2, 14 Hanover Square, W1, and 27 35 Mortimer Street, W1.
In each case the tenants committed to new, longer leases at a total rent of 4.1 million strengthening the Groups rental cash flow.
117.7 million of sales of West End investment property were executed during the period including 11 Maddox Street, W1, 17 19 Bedford Street, WC2, 33 Chancery Lane, WC2, 42 43 Drury Lane, WC2, Broad Court, WC2, 21 Bloomsbury Street, WC1 following the lease restructuring, 350 Oxford Street, W1, Kings Walk Shopping Mall, Kings Road, SW3 and three flats in Covent Garden.
These sales produced a surplus over the March 2002 values of 6.1 million net of costs, mainly from the sales of Bloomsbury Street and Kings Walk Shopping Mall.
We also sold the remaining flats at our residential development at Ranelagh House, SW3 resulting in a small trading loss.
Since the year end we have sold two properties, our last remaining flat in Covent Garden and 26a, b, c Albemarle Street, W1, for 10.8 million, in line with 31 March 2003 values.
We acquired one small investment property during the year and, more significantly, we exchanged contracts to buy a large refurbishment opportunity at Metropolis House, 39 45 Tottenham Court Road and 28 Percy Street, W1 for 16 million with completion due towards the end of June.
Starting on site in the late summer, we will completely recondition this 1960s tower to offer 100,000 sq.
ft. in a variety of Grade A floor sizes to the West End market in mid 2005.
City and Holborn The City market has continued to see the effects of excess supply as the expansionary boom of the late 1990s unwinds.
The real estate economy in the City is less diverse than the West End with a reliance on Financial and Business Services, a sector reported to have shrunk by 25,000 jobs in the City since 2001.
Our City and Holborn portfolio at 31 March 2003 was valued at 187.0 million, representing 24% of the Groups portfolio.
The fall in values of 14.1% was cushioned by the significant restructuring of this portfolio carried out during the year.
Average rents in our City portfolio were 32 per sq.
ft. in line with those at the same time last year.
Average rental values were 30 per sq.
Portfolio Review Annual Report 2003 19 Significant rent reviews were completed at 24 31 Holborn, EC1 and 90 Fetter Lane, EC4, where rents were increased from 0.7 million to 1.5 million, broadly in line with our estimates at the beginning of the year.
At 31 March 2003, we had no voids in the City and Holborn.
We continue to work to pre-empt potential voids through active asset management, an example of which was the lease restructuring with the Groups single largest tenant, Willis, at 1 Camomile Street, EC2.
Due to expire in September 2004, we extended the term on this 75,000 sq.
ft. of space to March 2011, in line with expiries at our adjoining holding, 80 Bishopsgate.
Put together, these two buildings comprise 130,000 sq.
ft. and represent an exciting medium-term opportunity to develop a significantly larger office building in a first rate City location.
During the year we sold 13 15 and 17 Moorgate, EC2 in two transactions for an aggregate price of 31.3 million, just in excess of their 31 March 2002 valuation.
The first of these was let at an average rent of 65 per sq.
ft. with 10.5 years remaining on the lease.
The rental value was virtually half this amount at the time we sold it in September.
Other Properties The remainder of our portfolio consists of assets located outside central London.
These are considered non-core and will be disposed of at best advantage over time.
At 31 March 2003 we had four assets in this category with an aggregate value of 42.4 million, up 0.5% over the period.
The portfolio comprises a leisure development at Sol Central, Northampton, now 95% let with the last significant unit under offer, two office buildings in Maidenhead and a recently-refurbished, largely vacant office building in Hounslow.
During the year we sold:Weybridge Business Park, Surrey: Stephenson and Knollys House, Addiscombe Road, Croydon: 714 746 London Road, Hounslow: 51 53 Station Road, Redhill: and a small parcel of land at London Road, Hounslow.
The aggregate net disposal receipts of 66.4 million, were some 8 million below the 31 March 2002 valuation.
