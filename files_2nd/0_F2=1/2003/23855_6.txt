However there is a notable bias at country level, Outlook - The European economic environment improved with a weighting in favour of the smaller peripheral during the last six months of 2003.
The prime driver of 8 this was the improving global outlook driven in particular by the improving economic outlook in the US.
The strengthening of the euro versus the US dollar in this context is notable, as the European economies are exhibiting slower GDP growth than the US.
For companies who export from the Eurozone to the US, this implies an important loss of competitiveness in a global context.
The strength of the euro should however mean that European interest rates will remain at a low level.
The terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 serve as an unwelcome reminder that global terrorism remains a continuing issue in the world.
This tragic event will have an impact on consumer and business confidence not only in Spain but across Europe.
The longer term effect of this on economic developments is impossible to predict, but it is notable that the 11 September 2001 attacks occurred at a point when stockmarkets and economies were already weakening: in contrast current conditions have been improving.
We continue to believe that stock selection, based on in-depth company analysis, will continue to be crucial over the coming year.
