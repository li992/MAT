The Directors have, however, no current intention of exercising that authority.
The second, a Special Resolution, relates to the limited power given to the Directors to allot equity securities for cash representing up to 5% of the existing issued ordinary share capital, without the statutory pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 1985 applying.
This power, which accords with normal practice, expires on the date of this years Annual General Meeting.

The third item of special business is the renewal of the authority of the Company to purchase its own ordinary shares as permitted under its Articles of Association.

The Directors have no immediate intention of using such authority and would do so only when they consider it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally and an improvement in earnings per share would result.
Prior to 1 December 2003, any shares purchased in this way would have been cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly.
However, the Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003 have altered the position to permit shares purchased by the Company out of distributable profits to be held as Treasury Shares which may be cancelled, sold for cash or transferred for the purposes of the Companys employee share schemes.
This Resolution specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased representing approximately 10% of the Companys existing issued ordinary share capital and the minimum and maximum prices at which they may be bought, reflecting the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and the Financial Services Authority.
The final resolution is a Special Resolution to consider and, if thought fit, to approve the changes to the Companys Articles of Association as outlined in the circular to shareholders dated 17 March 2004.
