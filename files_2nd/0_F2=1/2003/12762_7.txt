Finance Directors Review continued Trading Psion Teklogix recorded turnover of 129.1m, compared to 123.5m in 2002.
Psion Teklogix trades throughout the world and is affected both directly and indirectly by changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the US Dollar.
The average US Dollar to Sterling rate was $1.64 in 2003 compared to $1.50 in 2002.
On constant exchange rates, turnover was 5.7% higher than the prior year.
The translation of revenues to sterling is a direct effect of exchange rate changes.
Psion Teklogix is also indirectly affected in many non US Dollar markets as major global competitors tend to price in US Dollars to which Psion Teklogix must respond in order to remain competitive.
Psion Teklogix continues to maintain historical levels of expenditure on research and development.
In addition, the introduction of new products such as the NetBook Pro and 7535 handheld terminal required supporting launch related expenditure.
Despite this, operating profit at Psion Teklogix represented 7.7% of turnover in 2003, compared to 6.1% in 2002.
Psion Software did not generate any revenue in 2003, compared to 5.1m in 2002, which related to a contract development project that was completed in that year.
This operating loss included 0.8m 2002 0.3m in respect of the allocation of shared costs from the Head Office.
The terms of the disposal of Psion Software to Visto Corporation are described in Note 25 on page 60.
Joint Venture Psions results include a proportionate share of the results of Symbian, its joint venture investment.
Further details of Symbians results can be found in Note 12.
In February 2003, Samsung Electronics paid 17.0m for a 5% share of Symbian.
As a result, Psions shareholding was diluted from 26.6% to 25.3%.
In accounting terms, Psion disposed of 1.3% of Symbian with Symbian being valued at a total of 340m.
An unrealised gain of 4.0m has been recognised in the 2003 balance sheet.
In October 2003, Psion paid 17.5m for part of the Motorola shareholding in Symbian, with Nokia purchasing the balance of Motorola shares.
As a result of this transaction, Psions shareholding increased from 25.3% to 31.1%.
In accounting terms, Psion acquired 5.8% of Symbian with Symbian being valued at a total of 300m.
Goodwill of 16.4m was recorded on the balance sheet of Psion as part of this transaction.
On 8 February 2004, Psion entered into a binding agreement, subject to shareholder approval and regulatory authority clearance, to sell its entire shareholding in Symbian to Nokia OY.
Under the agreement Psion will receive an initial fixed payment of 93.5m in cash and further contingent payments payable in March 2005 and March 2006.
The subsequent payments will be equal to the total number of devices containing Symbian OS sold by licensees in 2004 and 2005, respectively, multiplied by 84.0 pence per unit.
Based upon analyst mean consensus estimates of units to be sold in these years the total of these payments would amount to 42.2m.
The contingent payment structure enables Psion to retain exposure to the performance of Symbian in the medium term.
Assuming that the necessary approvals are obtained, in 2004 Psion will record the results of Symbian up to the date of completion of the disposal.
The proceeds of disposal to be recorded in 2004 will be based on the fixed consideration payable at completion plus a prudent estimate of the deferred consideration discounted to reflect the anticipated receipt of cash.
The cost of disposal will be the carrying value of the investment at the date of disposal plus the external legal and advisory costs of the disposal.
The carrying value of the investment will depend on the results of Symbian up to the date of the disposal.
Exceptional Operating Expenses Exceptional operating expenses in 2003 totalled 1.7m 2002 1.0m surplus, which related to the centralisation of Psion Teklogixs hardware development in Canada and the reorganisation of its North American sales team see note 4. based on publicly available research between April 2003 and December 2003.
