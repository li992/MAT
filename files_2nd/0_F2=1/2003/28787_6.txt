This dividend will absorb 4.9 million of distributable reserves.
The movements on capital reserve and consolidated revenue reserve are shown in notes 21 and 22 on page 46.
NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value of one ordinary share at 31 March 2003, after deducting the proposed dividend of 3.1p per share, was 430.2p.
REVIEW OF BUSINESS The Company specialises in investments which are held with a view to achieving long-term capital growth.
The fixed asset investments were valued at 31 March 2003 at 684.5 million.
An analysis of these investments is contained in note 10 on page 38.

At the present time, the portfolio meets the requirements to enable the shares of the Company to be included as an investment within an Individual Savings Account ISA.
SHARE CAPITAL AND PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES Details of the authorised and issued share capital appear in note 19 on page 45 of the accounts.
No ordinary shares have been issued during the year.
During the year to 31 March 2003 the Company has not purchased any ordinary shares for cancellation.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 4 July 2002, the Company was given power to purchase up to 23,511,540 ordinary shares, which represented 14.99% of the issued share capital as at that date.
This power expires on 30 September 2003.
Share purchases are only made when they enhance the net asset value per share.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 14 Directors Report SHARE CAPITAL AND PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES CONTINUED A resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to seek power to purchase up to a maximum of 23,511,540 shares, at a price which is not less than 1 per share and not more than 5% above the average middle-market quotations for the preceding five business days.
This represents 14.99% of the present issued share capital.
If the issued share capital is less at the time of the Annual General Meeting by reason of purchases, the maximum will be 14.99% of that issued capital.
The authority now sought would last until 30 September 2004.
The Directors do not intend to purchase shares at more than their attributable net asset value.
SPECIAL BUSINESS AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Although the Companys Articles of Association provide that all unissued shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors, Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 requires that the authority of the Directors to allot relevant securities shall be subject to the approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Accordingly, shareholders are being asked at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to renew, for a period of one year, the Directors authorisation to allot the Companys unissued shares up to a nominal amount of 52,282,722, which is less than a third of the issued equity share capital of the Company at the date of this report.
The Directors have no present intention of allotting shares pursuant to this authority.
The amount specified for the current year follows the ABI guidelines.
The Directors also seek the renewal of the usual authority to enable them, during the period expiring on the date of the Annual General Meeting in 2004, to allot not more than 5% which would correspond to 7,842,408 shares of the issued shares as at 31 March 2003 for cash other than by way of rights.
It is the intention of the Directors, under such authority, not to allot shares at less than their attributable net asset value.
PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS The Directors are aware of the interests as at 20 May 2003 of the following companies, or the groups of which they are a member, in 3% or more of the ordinary issued share capital of the Company.
Number % of Share Shareholder of shares capital Prudential plc 7,550,509 4.81 Legal & General Investment Management Limited 5,384,530 3.43 Other than the interests of Lord Rothschild, representing 16.18% of the ordinary share capital of the Company at 20 May 2003 as set out on page 18, the Directors are not aware of any other disclosable interest representing 3% or more of the shares of the Company.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors Report 15 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Directors consider that the Company has complied throughout the year with the provisions of the Code of Best Practice set out in Section 1 of The Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice the Combined Code.
A detailed report was prepared at 30 June 2000 listing the internal control procedures undertaken within the Group.
This report has since been reviewed annually and subsequently considered by the executive Directors and the members of the Audit Committee.
The methods by which the Company has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code are detailed below and also in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 21 to 25.
The Directors The Board of Directors currently consists of two executive and seven non-executive Directors whose biographical details are given on page 12.
The Board meets regularly during the year and is provided with detailed and appropriate information concerning the Companys affairs and performance to enable the Directors to discharge their responsibilities in an informed manner.
The non-executive Directors are considered to be of sufficient calibre, experience and number to exercise significant independent judgement on the strategy and financial planning of the Group.
The Board is responsible for the overall investment strategy of the Company although it delegates the majority of the investment management responsibilities to the two executive Directors and to third party managers.
It is also responsible for approving both the annual and interim report and accounts.
The Board has delegated to the two executive Directors and other senior management the day to day responsibilities of budgetary control and administration.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Operating Officer are undertaken by Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge respectively who meet on a regular basis and maintain regular contact with the non-executive Directors.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.
In addition, Directors are able to take independent legal advice on the furtherance of their duties, at the Companys expense, up to a maximum of 25,000 per annum.
Although there is no formal Nomination Committee, it is the practice that any new nomination to the Board is discussed and agreed by all the Directors, thus ensuring that no one Director or group of Directors is able to exercise any undue influence.
In accordance with the Companys Articles of Association a third of all Directors are required to seek re-election by rotation at least every three years.
On joining the Board, new Directors are given background documents and information describing the history of the Company and its objectives.
Relations with Shareholders The Board and the directors of the management company maintain a dialogue with both institutional shareholders and analysts and also respond promptly to other shareholders enquiries.
Shareholders are invited to ask questions at the Annual General Meeting and, as far as is practicable, the Chairman of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee and the Audit Committee is always available at the same venue to answer any questions from shareholders.
The net asset value of the Company is disclosed on a monthly basis to the London Stock Exchange to enable shareholders and analysts to follow the progress of the Company.
The Company also maintains a website at www.
co. uk where the information is regularly updated.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 16 Directors Report CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED Accountability and Audit STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Company and the Group for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Internal Control The Board of Directors is responsible for the Groups system of internal control.
Such systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, as such, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against any material misstatement or loss.
The Board has delegated to executive management the implementation of the systems of internal control within an established framework applicable throughout the Group.
The Board considers that the necessary procedures have been implemented to satisfy the requirements of the Financial Services Authority with respect to the guidance Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code issued in September 1999.
The Board considered the need to establish a separate internal audit function.
However, it was decided that the size and nature of the Groups activities do not currently merit the additional expense and operational complexity that an internal audit function would entail.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the key systems of internal control in operation during the financial period through the monitoring processes set out below.
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT The Group has established an organisational structure which allocates defined levels of authority and reporting responsibility in respect of the operational, compliance, financial and taxation affairs of the Group to a small number of senior executives.
An executive committee, which consists of the two executive Directors and senior executives, meets regularly to discuss matters of importance to the Group.
RISK MANAGEMENT The identification of major business risks is carried out by the Board in conjunction with the relevant executives.
The mitigation and monitoring of risks identified is undertaken by the Board or the executive committee as appropriate.
Detailed portfolio valuations are undertaken every week and these form the basis for risk control decisions regarding equity exposure, liquidity, market price risk and exchange rate risk.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors Report 17 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONTROL PROCEDURES There is a budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the executive management.
Monthly actual results are reviewed and reported against budget and reviewed regularly by the executive management.
The Group maintains guidelines in relation to the key controls exercised over its financial and operating affairs.
Duties are segregated to the extent commensurate with the size of the Groups organisation and business environment.
Audit Committee On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee, which comprises three non-executive Directors, reviews the effectiveness of these systems.
The Committee meets bi-annually to receive reports arising from the external audit process and to review issues arising therefrom with management.
The Committee also monitors the adequacy of the Groups accounting policies and financial reporting and discusses the results of the external audit of the Groups accounts with the auditors.
The Audit Committee also considers the auditors independence, objectivity and the cost effectiveness of the audit process.
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference which deal clearly with its authority and duties.
Statement on Going Concern The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
DIRECTORS The present Directors, all of whom are non-executive other than Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge who are executive, were directors throughout the year.
The Directors are listed on page 12.
Pursuant to the Articles of Association, Timothy Barakett, Mikael Breuer-Weil and Baron Lambert will retire by rotation from the Board at the Annual General Meeting and will be proposed for re-election at that meeting.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 came into force on 1 August 2002 and require that the Company produce an annual report on the Companys remuneration policy and its Directors remuneration.
The Company is also required to put an annual resolution to shareholders for approval of that report.

The majority of the remainder of RITCPs investment portfolio is managed by the directors of JRCM.

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives: cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: and derivative transactions which the Group enters into to manage market risks and currency risks.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
Market Price Risk Market price risk arises from uncertainty about the future value of the Groups investments.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions as the result of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets by taking positions in index futures relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those particular markets or to enable increased exposure when appropriate.
Short-term exposure to movements in exchange rates caused by the buying and selling of investments for future settlement is mitigated through entering into forward contracts.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups total return and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements as a substantial proportion of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting its exposure to particular foreign currencies.
These contracts are used for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk when this is deemed appropriate.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are analysed in note 27 on pages 48 to 50.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 20 Directors Report DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations and take appropriate action.
PAYMENT OF SUPPLIERS It is the Companys payment policy to obtain the best terms for all business.
The Company agrees the terms on which business will take place with its suppliers, and it is the Companys policy to abide by such terms.
The Company had no trade creditors at the year end.
