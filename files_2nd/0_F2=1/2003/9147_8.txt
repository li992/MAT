At 2 February 2002, Crealfi S. A. the Groups French consumer finance business, was recognised as a subsidiary company because of the Groups ability to exercise control of the venture by way of a commitment to increase the Groups economic interest.
Accordingly, in the year ended 1 February 2003, the Group financial services turnover and profit figures include the results of Crealfi S. A. for the period to 31 July 2002 while it was a subsidiary of the Group.
On 31 July 2002 the Groups arrangements with Crealfi S. A. were amended such that the Group will no longer increase its economic interest above 49.99%.
As a result, the Group no longer has the ability to exercise control and the business is no longer a subsidiary.
Accordingly, Crealfi S. A. is not consolidated but included as a joint venture with effect from 1 August 2002 and its turnover and profit is included within joint ventures and associates turnover and profit for the period from 1 August 2002.
In the year ended 2 February 2002, the Groups financial services turnover and profit figures include the results of Time Retail Finance, the UK consumer finance operation which was disposed of on 31 January 2002.
