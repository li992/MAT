Directors The names and biographical details of the Directors of the Company are shown on pages 38 and 39.
The Directors retiring in accordance with the Articles of Association at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting are Mr T G Neiland, Dr A D Portno and Mr I Robertson, all of whom, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
Mr Robertson has a service contract with the Company terminable upon either the Company giving twelve months notice or Mr Robertson giving six months notice.
The other Directors standing for re-election do not have service contracts with the Company.

Mr A Greasley, who attained the age of 70 on 16th January 2004, has also indicated his intention to retire from the Board later in the year.
The Companys current intention is to replace them with two independent Non-Executive Directors in order to increase the number of independent Non-Executive Directors on the Board in line with the new standards of best practice set out in the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Directors and other substantial share interests The interests, as defined in the Companies Act 1985, of the Directors in the ordinary share capital of the Company are set out in the table on page 41.
The total number of ordinary shares in which the Directors taken together were beneficially interested as at 31st December 2003 was 31,754,232 excluding non-beneficial interests in respect of 1,216,937 ordinary shares held by Mr D W Wilson, or members of his family, and 202,000 ordinary shares held by Mr T G Neiland.
In addition to their conditional entitlement to matching ordinary shares held by the Trustee of the Trust set out on page 50, the Executive Directors are, for the purposes of the Companies Act 1985, regarded as being interested in all the 33,562 ordinary shares in the Company which the Trustee of the Trust held as at 31st December 2003.
It is not expected, however, that any Executive Director will be entitled to receive from the Trust a number of ordinary shares greater than those to which he is conditionally entitled under the Companys share incentive schemes.

41 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Report of the Directors WB RA f ckd 2003 40 52 26 2 04 12:12 pm Page 42 Report of the Directors continued Health and safety During 2003, the Group completed a full review of its health and safety processes.
The Board is committed to ensuring that the Groups activities are carried out in accordance with relevant statutory provisions and all reasonable and appropriate measures are taken to avoid risk to employees or others who may be affected.
Whilst management is committed to providing a safe working environment with the appropriate working practices and training, this can only be achieved if employees equally give their commitment to a rigorous health and safety culture.
The Group continues to develop and refine preventative measures to minimise the likelihood of accidents and incidents on site.
The valuable contribution from in-house experts and the sharing of best practice is fundamental to the Groups long-term health and safety strategy.
This includes site visits, workplace inspections and providing advice on statutory requirements and general safety matters.
A new system for monitoring safety performance was introduced towards the end of 2003.
Standards have been set for all sites, which will be closely monitored and assessed during 2004.
During 2003 there were no fatalities and there was a 10% reduction in reportable accidents.
Environmental policy The Board acknowledges the Groups responsibilities with regard to the environment and its approach to these matters is demonstrated in the Environmental Performance section on pages 22 and 23 and in the Environmental Review on pages 36 and 37.
Corporate governance The Boards statement on corporate governance is set out on pages 43 and 44.
Going concern The Group continues to place considerable emphasis on its budgeting and forecasting procedures and each month produces a forecast of trading and cash flow covering at least the forthcoming fifteen months.
Accordingly we continue to have in place all the procedures and information appropriate to the going concern assessment required by the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Having reviewed the Groups resources and a range of likely trading out-turns, the Directors believe that they have reasonable grounds for stating that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Donations Donations during the year for educational purposes, to charity and to local causes, amounted to 49,800 2002: 41,000.
There were no political donations during the year.
