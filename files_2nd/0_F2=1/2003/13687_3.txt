RPS Group Plc 24 Report and accounts 2003 The Board Composition and Operations The Board currently comprises four Executive and four Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman.
The Executive Directors are responsible for the management of all the Groups business activities.
The Non-Executive Directors are all independent of management and contribute independent judgement and extensive knowledge and experience to the proceedings of the Board.
The Chairman is also an Independent Non-Executive.
The Board generally meets on a monthly basis other than during holiday periods and more frequently when business needs require.
The Board has a schedule of matters referred to it for decision and the requirement for Board approval on these matters is communicated widely throughout the senior management of the Group.
Its principal tasks are to formulate strategy and to monitor and control operating and financial performance in pursuit of the Groups strategic objectives.
Where Directors have concerns which cannot be resolved about the running of the Company or a proposed action these concerns are recorded in the Board minutes.
It is the policy of the Company that if a Director resigns these concerns are provided in a written statement to the Chairman for circulation to the Board.
It is the responsibility of the Company Secretary to ensure appropriate insurance cover is maintained in respect of legal actions against Directors.
The level of cover has recently been increased to 10 million.
The Board is also responsible for the financing of the Group, material capital commitments, commencing or settling major litigation, corporate acquisitions and disposals and appointments to subsidiary company boards and anything else which may materially affect the Groups performance.
Comprehensive papers which deal with all material issues are circulated in advance of each meeting.
There is an agreed procedure for Non-Executive Directors to take independent professional advice and training at the Companys expense.
This is in addition to the access which every Director has to the Company Secretary.
The Secretary is charged by the Board with ensuring that Board procedures are followed.
When new members are appointed to the Board access is available to appropriate, external training courses and to advice from the Companys solicitors in respect of their role and duties as a public company Director if required.

The key functions of the Chairman are to conduct Board meetings and meetings of shareholders and to ensure that all Directors are properly briefed in order to take a full and constructive part in Board discussions.
The Chief Executive is required to develop and lead business strategies and processes to enable the Groups business to meet the requirements of its shareholders.
