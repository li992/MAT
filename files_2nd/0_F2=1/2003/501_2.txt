We do this on a global basis, with over 100 service centres, and operating in 28 countries worldwide.
The solutions we provide range from the simple to the very complex.
From the simple hire of a standby generator at a sporting event, to multi-million pound contracts to maintain production in petrochemical plants, support military and humanitarian operations, or provide additional generating capacity to national electricity grids.

For our customers, power, temperature control, and oil-free air are services on which their businesses are totally dependent.
Most of our customers use our services only occasionally but when they do, they rely on us to keep their business or operation running.
