Aldershot brick plant, Ontario The Aldershot brick plant is the jewel in the crown of Hanson Brick in North America.
Located just outside Toronto, it was designed to replace an ageing facility whose clay reserves were exhausted.
Commissioned at the end of 2001 at a total investment of C$63m it had its ofcial opening in the spring of 2002.
It is the largest single brick production facility in North America producing high quality bricks.
The plant impact on the bottom line has also been significant with a better than expected unit cost performance.
The additional capacity has been a significant advantage to our sales teams in a very strong market: where Hanson Brick has managed to consistently meet the demands of its customers.

In the Pipe & Products division continuing trading profit fell by 4.8% to 92.5m, including acquisitions.
Although heritage volumes in this division fell 5.7%, prices increased 2.7% in declining markets.
In 2002, pressure pipe declined from a record year in 2001, due mainly to lower volumes and the delay of a major project in Dallas.
The acquisitions of Centennial in Canada in 2001 and Choctaw in the south eastern United States in 2002 made an important contribution, increasing overall volumes by 12.7% in 2002.
Continuing trading profit from the Brick & Tile division improved by 4.0% to 33.9m compared to 2001, benefiting from the demand for housing in 2002 and leading to record margins.
Despite a 1.8% decline in volumes and the effect of reorganisation costs, brick unit margins increased slightly, reecting higher prices.
The decline in volumes in 2002 was primarily due to the sale of a brick plant in Mississippi and production difficulties at some of the divisions operations, which were overcome.
