In Healthcare, we have a high concentration of large customers and the returns on average are generally somewhat lower than in Industrial & Consumer Care.
Our focus here will be on cash generation through selective investment and we will look to create value through our polymer technology partnerships.
Overall for Materials Technology, our focus will be on improving returns through continued productivity and mix change and strong cash generation.
Looking Forward Focus on Growth The progress that the Group has made in the second half of 2003 puts us in a strong position to move forward in both earnings and cash flows.
However, our translated earnings will be affected by movements in the US dollar.
We anticipate some benefit from improving economies, particularly in North America, but we will also see full year benefits from new contracts and acquisitions completed during the course of 2003.
We have strengthened both businesses by working relentlessly on productivity whilst still investing to grow.
As a result, we are now in a position where our operational leverage is good, our cost base is tight, our free cash flows are growing stronger and we have a good team in place.
Our priority now is to put an increasing emphasis on growth whilst continuing to apply the fundamentals on which we have focused in the past.
