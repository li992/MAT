62 Annual Report 2003 integrated global management structure Investecs management structure, reporting lines and responsibilities have been built around a geographic, product and functional matrix.
It is structured around global divisional leaders, global roles and geographic business leaders.
This management structure enables the group to meet the challenge of regional responsiveness and global competence.
The integrated global model enables the group to take advantage of best economies of scale, leverage resources and core competencies, and exploit synergies across all regions in which the group operates.
The directors believe that the links between its overlapping parts, and the degree of effective integration, make the matrix an effective model.
The quality of the links is a result of values-based behaviour and practice, which are key drivers of Investecs culture.
