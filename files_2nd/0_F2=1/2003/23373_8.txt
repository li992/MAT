The highest paid director in 2002 was Paul Gratton whose emoluments for 2002 were 700,035, in addition to a pension contribution of 32,568 to a defined benefit pension scheme.
Stacey Cartwright resigned from the Egg plc Board on 26 September 2003.
Under the terms of an agreement with the Company concluded at that time, which reflected the principle of mitigation, Stacey left the Group and was entitled to receive her monthly salary, bonus and other benefits until the expiry of her contract, which is due to take effect on 29 February 2004.
The salary, bonus and other benefits figures in the above table relate to the period of her service between 1 January and 26 September 2003.
The additional sum shown as other payments to former director represents the total value of salary, bonus and other benefits payable under the above agreement following her resignation as a director.
Additionally, Stacey was also entitled to retain certain share options under the Egg Employee Share Option Plan and share awards under the Egg Restricted Share Plan as shown in tables 5 and 6.
Mark Nancarrow was appointed to the Board on 26 September 2003 and David Doyle on 10 October 2003.
The figures shown above are pro-rated and relate to the period in which they served as executive directors.
Pensions All of the executive directors have pension arrangements to which the Group makes contributions.
Paul Gratton participates in an individual defined benefit scheme whilst Mike Harris, Stacey Cartwright and Mark Nancarrow have individual defined contribution schemes.
David Doyle is a member of the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.

Remuneration of non-executive directors The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board, and are set at a level that, historically, has been sufficient to attract and retain individuals of the appropriate calibre.
Jonathan Bloomer was remunerated by Prudential plc.
His services to the Group were of a non-executive nature and his emoluments were deemed to be wholly attributable to his services to Prudential plc for the period.
The fees shown are for services as director of Egg plc and its subsidiaries from 1 January 2003.
Pascal Cagni joined the Board on 29 April 2003, and Ronnie Baird joined the Board on 21 October 2003.
Their fees for 2003 are therefore pro-rated.

The service contracts for Mike Harris and Paul Gratton are dated 22 May 2000.
The service contract for Mark Nancarrow is dated 26 September 2003 and the service contract for David Doyle is dated 10 October 2003.
Each of the executive directors contracts is terminable by either side giving twelve months written notice of termination.
In either case, the Group will not require the individual to carry out their normal duties under the contract for more than six months.
The Committee has discretion over any compensation for any unvested long-term incentives in the case of loss of office by an executive.
Long-term incentives The Group operates a restricted share plan the Restricted Share Plan and an employee share option plan the Share Option Plan.
Awards were granted to executive directors under both plans at the time of the Initial Public Offering.
These awards were designed to take into account the inherent value accumulated under a previous cash based long-term incentive arrangement Long-term Incentive Plan in the eighteen months prior to flotation.
For this reason performance conditions were not applied to these grants.
This plan terminated upon flotation.
It has been the policy of the Remuneration Committee to grant awards of long-term incentives annually, under either or both the Restricted Share Plan and the Share Option Plan.
In the event that awards are made in 2004, it is intended that the level of awards will be maintained, with UK awards being delivered in restricted shares.
Performance conditions apply to the grant of awards under both plans.
Performance conditions on grant are based on the delivery of Eggs business plan for the year, and the individual responsibilities necessary to deliver the plan.
The targets for the Egg business plan were achieving profit, sales and revenue targets: individual responsibilities were in support of that plan.
For executive directors, the key individual responsibilities are: Paul Gratton ensuring delivery of the Groups operating plan and achieving the optimal positioning of information technology, brand and cost base necessary for both the year and for Eggs future plans: David Doyle ensuring business strategies are value creative and deliver the financial targets incorporated in the Groups operating plan, ensuring the integrity of financial results and implementing sound risk management: Mike Harris devising Eggs future strategic plans: Mark Nancarrow delivery of the customer proposition, customer service and long-term customer value.
These are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance conditions were not applied to the vesting of awards granted under the Restricted Share Plan before 2002 or under the Share Option Plan.

Total Shareholder Return TSR against the FTSE 350 was felt to be the most appropriate measure in the absence of specific comparators for Eggs stage of growth.
This is a general index and outperforming this is a reasonable measure of providing return to shareholders.
The proportion of the initial award that vests will be determined by the Committees assessment of Eggs TSR ranked against the FTSE 350 at the end of the measurement period.
The measurement period begins on the date of the award and ends on the third anniversary thereof.
Depending on positioning against this group, the actual number of restricted shares received will be based on a multiplier of between 0 and 4 times the basic award shown in table 5.
The basic award will normally be given at median ranking against the TSR results for the FTSE 350, with straight-line interpolation rising to twice the basic award if performance is at upper quartile ranking, and quadruple the basic award if performance is at top ranking illustrated Figure 1 below.
Eggs performance against the FTSE 350 is shown in Figure 2 below.

The positioning for on target achievement against stretching objectives is validated with reference to the median of total direct compensation for the comparator group of retail banks in the FTSE 350, outlined earlier.
From 2002 Watson Wyatts Present Economic Value PEV methodology has been applied to arrive at long-term incentive award levels.
This builds on the mathematical and economic principles underlying the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The advantage of this methodology is that it allows the Remuneration Committee to value consistently all types of long-term incentives taking into account features relating to the expected future share price volatility and dividends, performance and exercise conditions.
A minimum shareholding requirement was introduced from 2003, whereby executive directors are required to hold shares to the value of twice their annual salary after seven years, with an interim requirement to hold shares to the value of their annual salary after three years.
Egg Restricted Share Plan On 25 April 2000, the Group adopted the Restricted Share Plan, under which executive directors of the Group may be awarded shares in Egg plc.

The executive directors of Egg plc ceased to be eligible to receive new awards under these schemes on 1 January 1999.
Prudential Restricted Share Plan At the end of each three-year performance period executive directors and certain other senior managers of Prudential plc may be granted a right to receive shares at no cost to the individual, dependent on the Companys performance.
For RSP awards prior to 2004, no rights are granted if the Companys TSR performance as ranked against the comparator group is at the 60th percentile or below.
The maximum grant will be made only if the TSR ranking of the Company is 20th percentile or above.
Between these points, the size of the grant made is calculated on a straight-line sliding scale.
In normal circumstances, directors may take up their right to receive shares at any time during the following seven years.
In respect of awards made in 2000 under the Restricted Share Plan, the Companys TSR was ranked 62nd out of the 88 relevant comparator companies remaining in the FTSE 100 ie, the 70th percentile for the three year performance period ended on 31 December 2002.
As Prudentials position was lower than 60th percentile, the 2000 awards lapsed and rights were not granted over any of the shares conditionally awarded to executive directors.
In respect of awards made in 2001 under the Restricted Share Plan, the Companys TSR was ranked 66th out of the 95 relevant comparator companies remaining in the FTSE 100 ie, the 69th percentile for the three year performance period ended on 31 December 2003.
As Prudentials position was lower than 60th percentile, the 2001 awards lapsed and rights will not be granted over any of the shares conditionally awarded to executive directors.
The awards made in respect of 2002 and 2003 under the Restricted Share Plan run to 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005 respectively and any grants under these plans will be based on the TSR ranking determined at the end of each of those performance periods.
Performance under these plans was ranked respectively at percentile positions 81 and 66 on the basis of TSR performance at 31 December 2003.
In determining the conditional awards to be made for 2003 the shares were valued at their average share price during the preceding calendar year, and the price used to determine the number of shares conditionally awarded in 2003 was 5.703 2002: 8.187.

50 Egg plc Annual Report 2003 Directors report continued Corporate social responsibility Community During the year, we initiated our first community policy with a dedicated budget of 250,000 which will be matched with a further equivalent 250,000 in voluntary time by our employees.
Our policy is to encourage all Egg people to be active in our communities and our policy has been devised in response to asking all our people how they would wish these monies to be used.
Our programme is focused on arts, education, sports and regeneration.
In 2003, we joined Business in the Community BITC, the UK charity that encourages business to improve its positive impact on society.
With BITCs assistance and support, we have devised and launched the Developing Local Talent Fund, our first community project, in Derby.
Egg is Derbys second largest employer, with around 1,700 people working at our premises in Pride Park.
Projects we have begun include: Derby County Football Club, where we have launched a football skills challenge into a number of local schools: Derby Playhouse, with whom we have created the Egg Theatre Academy: and Derby Rugby Football Club, with whom we have launched a rugby development programme.
We plan to use our experience in Derby to contribute to communities at our other locations.
Environment Our commitment to good environmental performance adds value to Egg, reduces business risk and gives Egg people a pride in their work.
We have a corporate environmental policy and a main Board member with specific responsibility for the environment.
We are working to bring our environmental management system EMS in line with the recognised ISO14001 standard.
Egg is listed in the FTSE4Good Index Series, a stock market index designed to measure the performance of companies that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards.
We have reported on our environmental performance for two years and have data since 2001.
Our performance against targets is shown in the table opposite.
Our environmental impacts are direct, such as the use of transport, energy and paper, or indirect, such as our decisions on investment and insurance.
We are a retail bank and do not make commercial loans.
This is a summary of our environmental performance.
Highlights of 2003 Set seven management targets see www.
com environment for details covering issues such as stakeholder dialogue and supply chain environmental rating.
From November 2003 electricity from renewable sources has been used at our Derby operations centre.
We will consider using more renewable energy in our buildings where possible.
Environmental sustainability was an integral part of the design and fit-out of the new building on our Derby campus.
Issues considered included: maximising the use of daylight and reducing the need for electric lights: automatic controls on lighting, air conditioning, taps, pumps and fans, to reduce wastage.
Incoming fresh air is heated by outgoing stale air, reducing heating demand.

2 2 We report emissions for the first time, using UK government conversion factors.
By 2005 we intend to reduce CO emissions from energy by 10%, 2 based on 2002 03 baseline.
3 We prefer to set stretching targets for the main parameters the table shows additional data rather than easily achievable targets.
Although we risk falling short of our goals, this demanding attitude drives us to make sustainable improvements.
Increased demands for power from a new building 2 in Derby primarily a data centre with fewer people per m has increased the electricity used per person.
Modifications to lighting systems in our other buildings in Dudley and Derby took longer to implement than planned.
Savings will be shown in 2004 data.
4 The targets proved too stretching.
We are reviewing our water minimisation strategy.
Renewed efforts will be made to cut water use.
We are working to further reduce car miles.
6 The underlying trend has improved year on year.
We are looking at ways to further improve our performance to meet the stretching target.
Supplier payment policy In most cases the supplier of goods or services does so under standard terms of contract that lay down terms of payment.
In other cases, specific terms are agreed beforehand.
It is the Groups policy to ensure that the terms of payment are notified in advance and adhered to.
The total outstanding indebtedness of the Group to trade creditors as at 31 December 2003 amounted to 7.6 million 31 December 2002: 2.0 million, corresponding to 29 days purchases when averaged over the year.
Auditors A resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
Going concern The Board has satisfied itself that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
The Groups financial statements have accordingly been prepared on a going concern basis.
