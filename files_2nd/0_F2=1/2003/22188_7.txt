Directors The Board comprises four executive directors and three independent non-executive directors, details of whom, together with brief biographical information, are set out on pages 16 and 17.
The companys Articles of Association require that one third, or as nearly as possible, of the directors retire by rotation each year.
Accordingly, the directors retiring by rotation and, being eligible, offering themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting on 7 May 2004 are N N Broadhurst, non-executive director, who does not have a service contract, M W G Collins and J J Corr, both of whom hold ofce as executive directors and have rolling service contracts requiring a period of 12 months notice from the company or six months from the director.
Mr B Cottingham, non-executive Chairman, attained the age of 70 years on 5 October 2003 and will have served as a director for nine years on 11 May 2004.
The companys Articles of Association exclude Section 293 of the Companies Act 1985 requiring a director to vacate his ofce at the age of 70 and, having satisfied the test of independence on his appointment as Chairman in 1999, the requirement of the new Combined Code on Corporate Governance paragraph A.
7.2 requiring a non-executive director, who has served for more than nine years, to be subject to annual re-election, does not apply to Mr Cottingham.
Notwithstanding this, Mr Cottingham and the Board have concluded that it would be good Corporate Governance practice for the Chairman to retire and offer himself for re-election at the annual general meeting.
The Board has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders the re-election of Mr Cottingham as a director as they greatly value his wide business experience and his continuing contribution to the leadership and effectiveness of the Board.
All directors are re-elected at intervals of not more than three years, in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code of Corporate Governance appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Details of the directors remuneration, share options and pension arrangements are set out in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration on pages 25 to 33.
