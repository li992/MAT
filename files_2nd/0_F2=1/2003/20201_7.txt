The improvement was also due to lower levels of new business in 2003 with UK GAAP recognising more of the profit up-front while US GAAP spreads the profit over the life of the contract and there is therefore a greater benefit from the in-force book.

A decrease of 882m in goodwill from income of 714m in 2002 to expense of 168m in 2003 primarily due to a 660m difference on impairments recognised under UK and US GAAP in 2002 see table below and additional goodwill of 190m recorded under US GAAP, disposed of in 2003.

Material movements include: A decrease of 841m in shareholders interests in long-term assurance business from income of 114m in 2001 to expense of 727m in 2002, primarily due to the recognition of deficits in the with-profits funds in 2002 as set out above.
A decrease of 121m in income from securitisation primarily due to a higher volume of mortgages securitised in 2001 compared to 2002.
Partially offsetting these decreases above is an increase of 671m from an expense of 7 7m in 2001 to income of 594m in 2002 in amortisation, primarily due to 1,138m of impairments recognised under UK GAAP in 2002 while only 478m was recognised under US GAAP.
