These activities comprise Corporate Finance, Institutional Research, Sales and Trading, Private Equity and Direct Investments.
The business positions itself across these operations as a super boutique, focusing on specific market niches.
It targets clients seeking highly customised service, which Investec offers through a combination of domestic depth and expertise and client centric approach.
The client base of the division includes: Major listed and unlisted corporations.
Overview of performance The prolonged weakness in financial markets and subdued trading volumes had a severe impact on the performance of the Investment Banking division.
Operating profit before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items declined by 62.6% to 17.3 million.
In South Africa, the Investment Banking division reported declining results, largely as a result of the lack of realisation opportunities in the direct investment portfolio from which the division had benefited in the previous year.
In the UK, Investec Investment Banking and Securities posted an operating loss.
In the circumstances and given the lack of visible prospects of a market recovery, the divisions cost base was significantly restructured.
Accordingly, a significant decline in staff numbers and the outsourcing of support activities, such as certain settlement functions, resulted in costs falling from a peak annualised rate of 29 million to 18 million.
Investec Inc. in the US, which was particularly vulnerable to the dramatic decline in equity markets, posted operating losses.
Towards the end of the financial year, the group decided it was not prudent to sustain the ongoing losses in the US Investment Banking operations, given the unlikelihood of the establishment of a profitable competitive business in the region.
Consequently, a strategic decision was taken to wind down the Investment Banking operations in the US.
At the beginning of the 2003 calendar year, PMG Advisors was sold and by the end of May 2003 all Investment Banking activities had ceased operation.
The cost of closing this activity is recognised as an exceptional item in the groups 2003 results.
Further information is provided on page 12 and 13.
In Australia, Investec Wentworth performed well, notwithstanding difficult market conditions.
100 Annual Report 2003 Operating profit - Corporate Finance and Institutional Research, Sales and Trading UK GAAP 000 31 March 2003 31 March 2002 Variance % Change Net interest income 6 166 5 045 1 121 22.2% Net fees and commissions receivable 34 765 68 964 34 199 49.6% Dealing profits 4 392 7 920 3 528 44.5% Other operating income and dividends 152 19 133 100% Admin expenses, depreciation, provisions 44 917 56 290 11 373 20.2% Operating profit 558 25 658 25 100 97.8% Before taxation, amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items.
The variance in the operating profit over the period can be explained as follows: Difficult market conditions continued to impact the Investment Banking division, particularly in the UK, where deal fees and commissions fell by 32.5 million.
In South Africa, deal fees and commissions declined marginally, with the Corporate Finance division concluding 55 corporate finance deals compared to 65 in the previous year.
Dealing profits were negatively impacted by a decline of more than 80% in UK market making revenues compared to the prior year.
Administrative expenses were positively influenced by significant restructuring that took place during the year in the UK, as well as a sharp decline in incentive-based remuneration given declining profitability.
The decline in personnel expenses was around 11 million.
Operating profit - Direct Investments and Private Equity UK GAAP 000 31 March 2003 31 March 2002 Variance % Change Net interest income 1 172 1 839 667 36.3% Net fees and commissions receivable 1 375 397 978 100% Dealing profits 4 397 260 4 657 100% Other operating income and dividends 14 110 24 499 10 389 42.4% Admin expenses, depreciation, provisions 1 974 2 162 188 8.7% Operating profit 16 736 20 635 3 899 18.9% Before taxation, amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items.
The variance in the operating profit over the period can be explained as follows: Net interest payable was positively affected by a reduction in loan balances, following the sale of certain investments in the prior year.
The divisions net fees and commissions receivable increased as a result of certain management and other fees received on transactions concluded during the period.
Annual Report 2003 101 Dealing profits increased as a result of the net positive mark-to-market adjustments in the groups private equity and direct investment portfolios.
Other operating income declined, largely as a result of the approximate net 15 million profit made on the disposal of investments after taking into account impairments, in the previous year.
This negative variance was offset by a strong performance from the UK Private Equity division, which benefited from the realisation of the partial disposal of one of its investments amounting to approximately 9 million.
Developments Key business developments over the past year are outlined below.
Corporate Finance South Africa Investec Corporate Finance continued its strong performance.
The division focused on group and corporate restructuring activities, shareholder activism mandates and black economic empowerment BEE transactions.
In accordance with Investecs BEE strategy, the division participated in both an advisory and an investment capacity in the acquisition by Peu Investment Group of a 20% equity interest in Capital Alliance Limited for R420 million, and the formation of Tiso Capital Partners.
The number of corporate finance transactions completed during the period declined to 55 2002: 65, while the number of sponsor broker deals increased to 45 2002: 36.
The division continued to seek creative and effective ways to develop value-added solutions for its clients.
The division was ranked first in volume and value of transactions in the Dealmakers Magazine Survey for Corporate Finance March 2003.
It was ranked second for advising on the highest volume and value of M&A transactions in the Ernst & Young Survey March 2003.
UK and Europe The performance of the division was severely impacted by difficult market conditions, reflected in declining fund raisings and advisory work plus lower stock market valuations.
The number of M&A deals and fund raising transactions completed during the period declined to 13 2002: 25 and to 10 2002: 24 respectively.
Despite this, the retained corporate client list was strengthened, with 13 wins as opposed to six losses.
The average market capitalisation of the corporate client list is approximately 86 million.
Australia Investec Wentworth secured a significant share of transactions, at a time when the level of M&A activity and capital raisings were substantially down in the Australian market.
The division advised on 20 deals valued at A$2.5 billion during the financial year.
102 Annual Report 2003 Israel During the year, the Corporate Finance and Research division was downsized, given market conditions.
Institutional Research, Sales and Trading South Africa The agency business suffered as a result of the lower average volumes traded on the JSE Securities Exchange of South Africa JSE.
The Structured Equity Desk continued its strong performance, with its activities now spanning both the JSE and FTSE.
The Institutional division of Investec Securities Limited successfully repositioned itself in the marketplace.
The divisions full service offering, with an emphasis on broad-based market coverage and significantly augmented execution capability, was well received by clients.
Noteworthy client rankings in the Financial Mail Survey May 2003 indicate that Investec Securities Limited is well positioned to leverage off the credible platform that has been created.
UK and Europe Despite low levels of activity, the divisions market share in large cap stocks increased from 1.3% to almost 2.2% of UK agency commissions.
The business expanded its research offering and market making capabilities, both of which enhanced Investec Investment Banking and Securities profile in the UK market.
Furthermore, the division continues to work closely with Institutional Stockbroking in South Africa, as demonstrated in the profitable launch of the Structured Equity Desk.
Israel Stockbroking commissions were negatively impacted by reduced domestic market activity, although this was partially offset by an encouraging increase in commissions on Nasdaq listed Israeli stocks.
Falling stock values also affected custody revenues.
Although the bank was awarded its first custodian contract by a bank, all previous clients were independent asset managers.
Private Equity and Direct Investments South Africa The Private Equity division enjoyed good quality transaction flow and benefited from an upward revaluation of certain of its investments.
There was a lack of opportunities in the Direct Investments portfolio from which the division had benefited in the previous year.
UK and Europe The Private Equity division benefited from a significant realisation in one of the underlying funds, amounting to approximately 9 million.
Annual Report 2003 103 The aggregate book value of the Private Equity and Investment portfolio was 23.4 million 2002: 27.1 million.
Australia Weak equity markets provided attractive opportunities, with amongst other things, the division investing A$8 million to acquire a one-third stake in mobile phone retailer, Fone Zone.
Outlook The outlook for the Investment Banking division is naturally geared towards the state of global equity markets.
The primary objective of the division is to secure its current positions and continue to build its operations in each of the markets in which it operates, with a strong focus on enhancing overall profitability.
South Africa The Investment Banking division in South Africa should benefit, going forward, as a result of a number of international banks scaling down their securities and advisory businesses.
Investec Securities Limited is well positioned to take advantage of an eventual upturn in market conditions, although it is difficult to anticipate when any meaningful turnaround will occur.
Furthermore, Investec Corporate Finance has a strong position in the market, with well-established relationships with clients and a pipeline of deals that remains steady.
The Private Equity divisions strategy is to remain niched and continue to focus on transactions where value can be leveraged through the divisions involvement and through the implementation of a specific approach.
UK and Europe In the UK, Investec Investment Banking and Securities believes that its strategic focus combined with the breadth and depth of its coverage have not been materially reduced by the restructuring activities that took place during the period.
The division is focusing on a number of revenue initiatives aimed at account management and new corporate client wins.
Furthermore, while there is scope for small further gains in Private Equity depending on market conditions, these opportunities are expected to be limited in the next financial year.
Australia In Australia, the group has made significant progress with building a sound platform for its Advisory and Private Equity businesses.
The group currently has two private equity funds and is looking to raise a third one.
The weak equity markets provide reasonable opportunities for the division.
The division will continue to focus on building a profitable and recognised business by maintaining a solid deal pipeline, aggressively targeting new clients, enhancing brand awareness and further integrating its operations into Investecs international network.
