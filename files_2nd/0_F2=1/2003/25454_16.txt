The company also offers a selection of offshore products to investors in Europe, Asia and the US.
Investec Asset Management seeks to position itself as a manufacturer of a limited number of high quality core products.
At present, its core specialities are South African, UK and global equities, fixed income and balanced products.
The company also offers a range of absolute return products.
Investec Asset Management uses predominantly non-proprietary distribution channels, thereby limiting potential conflicts of interest.
The business continues to invest in its capacity to engage and service these distribution channels.
Overview of performance Investec Asset Management, in the face of difficult equity market conditions, demonstrated its resilience and continued to build the capacity required to operate effectively.
For the business, this was a year of consolidation in South Africa and significant progress in the UK.
The transition from a single country fund manager with a limited product range in 1999 to an international fund manager with strong foundations in South Africa and the UK, able to reach into a wide variety of international markets, is complete.
A clear structure, solid leadership core and strong staff complement are in place.
Noteworthy developments over the past year include: Earnings proved resilient in the most demanding business environment yet experienced by the business.
Acceptance from leading UK consultants and multi-managers came earlier than expected.
A strong brand in the UK IFA market began to emerge, shown by market share growth.
The London-based investment team showed excellent investment performance in core propositions global and UK equities, balanced and fixed income.
The business achieved a transition from a balanced to a specialist house in South Africa.
Performance was disappointing against the peer group of South African balanced funds.
South African specialist performance was excellent.
The South African retail operations, now called Investec Personal Investments, had a successful year.
Investec Asset Management reported operating profit before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items of 19.5 million, which represented growth of 4.0% in Rand terms and a 6.8% decline in Sterling terms.
Assets under management increased by 3.4% in Sterling terms to 16.8 billion but declined by 20.0% in Rand terms to R210.6 billion.
108 Annual Report 2003 The variance in the operating profit over the period can be explained as follows: In South Africa, the Personal Investments division performed well, with a solid increase in retail fees earned.
This was as a result of improved flows approximately R1 billion 60 million, endorsing the strategic direction embarked on two years ago, and an increase in funds under management acquired from Fedsure which was only reflected for 10 months of the 2002 financial year.
Despite a reduction in fees and commissions earned, caused by an outflow of funds from former Fedsure clients approximately R8 billion 480 million, the Institutional Investments division continued to post a strong performance.
This was as a result of performance fees earned and cost containment initiatives.
The UK and Other International Operations division benefited from a reduction in expenditure approximately 4 million, largely due to tight cost control, a decline in headcount and minimal salary increases.
Despite net inflows to the institutional and retail funds, weak equity market conditions impacted on overall revenue.
Deal fees once-off fees were the most significantly affected, with retail once-off fees declining due to lower initial fees, while several once-off transactions from the prior year for example, restructuring costs and investment trust initial commission on a new trust were not repeated in 2003.

Despite difficult markets, experience and management stability enable Investec Asset Management to retain its focus on real issues, namely investment performance, client retention and sales.
The divisions leading position in South Africa provides a strong base from which to engage competitors domestically and internationally.
The company bought, and decisively turned around, a UK-based business amid one of the most testing bear markets in the last century.
Since the acquisition of Guinness Flight in 1999, Investec Asset Management has focused on the UK as a large, second domestic market.
In order to achieve this, Investec Asset Management has assembled and retained world-class equity and fixed income skills and has focused the business on a relatively small number of core investment propositions.
Today, Investec 114 Annual Report 2003 Asset Management is endorsed by the industrys most prestigious distributors and continues to deliver outstanding investment performance.
Investec Asset Managements long-term orientation, the determination to win and ability to retain key people, have historically set it apart from the competition.
For 12 years, management has been building an asset management success story.
It was never plain sailing, but these conditions are the most challenging yet.
The 13th year will be tough, but if management remains focused on its clearly articulated objectives, the foundation for the next growth phase of Investec Asset Management will have been laid.
assurance activities Head of Assurance Activities Ciaran Whelan Overview of performance and key business developments The groups South African life assurance activities, conducted by Investec Employee Benefits IEB reported operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill of 27.8 million, a decline of 10.6%.
Operational earnings increased significantly from 15.5 million to 51.7 million.
These results were positively influenced by further restructuring of the business and its investment portfolios, particularly in the first half of the financial year.
However, since embedded value accounting has been implemented, the net movement in the value of in-force business is accounted for in the profit and loss account, with the result that the current years operational earnings were offset by a negative adjustment of 23.9 million, compared to a positive movement of 15.6 million in the prior year.
Towards the end of the financial year the group concluded a deal with Liberty Group Limited Liberty whereby certain of the liabilities of the retirement fund administration business and the existing disability claimants business were reinsured with Liberty with effect from 31 March 2003 the deal is still subject to approval by the Competition Commission.
As a result of the actuarial reassessment of policyholder liabilities and the value of the in-force business at the year end, the effect of the deal with Liberty was to generate a profit of approximately 11 million, included in the operational earnings mentioned above, offset by a reduction in the value of in-force business of approximately 7 million.
The rationale behind this transaction was to: Reduce Investecs exposure to administration intensive businesses, which require significant infrastructure and ongoing investment: and Transfer liabilities of approximately 290 million to Liberty.
Post the implementation of the transaction IEB will mainly comprise: A Risk Only division.
Annual Report 2003 115 The Risk Only division provides death and disability benefits on a standalone basis where another company is responsible for the member administration.
The management of disability claims and the provision of various disability and underwriting services is also offered.
It is IEBs intention to aggressively grow this line of business and to become a significant player in this market without the legacy of huge administration systems.
Investec is confident that this line of business will be successfully integrated into the group as the nature of this business fits into the groups core competencies of risk management.
The division is in the process of setting its strategy for the Risk Only division and is currently revising its products and operating procedures in line with client feedback.
The Investment Only division is effectively an asset management function.
IEB will continue to manufacture appropriate investment and risk products to distribute to its client base.
