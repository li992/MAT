b There are five ordinary shares in an ADS.
The earnings per ADS have also been restated for the restructuring and refinancing in 1999.
The 1999 restructuring and refinancing represents a change in identity of the parent company rather than an acquisition.
Consequently, it has been accounted for under UK GAAP using merger accounting principles.
However, under US GAAP, the restructuring and refinancing would be treated as a reverse stock split and earnings per ADS have been restated.
c The reduction in gross assets between 1999 and 2000 is primarily due to the transfer of certain businesses to Lattice Group plc.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 Five year financial summary unaudited continued ANNUAL DIVIDENDS The table below sets out the amounts, on a UK GAAP basis, of interim, final and total dividends paid in respect of each of the years in the five years ended 31 December 2003 in Sterling per ordinary share.
These amounts are also shown translated, solely for convenience with the associated UK tax credit included, but after deduction of withholding tax, into US$ per ADS each representing five ordinary shares at the Noon Buying Rate on each of the respective payment dates for such interim and final dividends.
ADR holders will be entitled to receive the US$ equivalent of 0.093 per ADS on 7 June 2004.
The Company is not subject to any laws or agreements that materially restrict its ability to pay dividends from distributable reserves other than those disclosed in note 30, page 115.
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 1.86p, bringing the total for the year to 3.46p.
Future dividends will be dependent on the cash flow, earnings and financial condition of the Company and other factors.
Dividends are paid by the Company in Sterling and exchange rate fluctuations will affect the US$ amounts received by ADR holders on conversion by JPMorgan Chase Bank as depository of such cash dividends paid.
Moreover, fluctuations in the Sterling US$ exchange rate will affect the US$ equivalent of the Sterling price of the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to affect the market price of the ADSs in the USA.
