17 We are implementing this new style of OFR for the first time this year.
The intention is to provide existing and potential shareholders with a good understanding of our business, not only by outlining our performance during the reporting period but also by providing information on our strategy and objectives, our industry, the regulatory framework within which we operate and the structures by which we run our business.
These are exciting times for Acambis.
We are well positioned to build on our recent successes to establish Acambis as one of the worlds leading vaccine companies.
