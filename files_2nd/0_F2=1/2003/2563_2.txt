Statement by the Director General continued Statement by the Director General continued New EC Directives New EC Directives 17.
As part of the implementation of the new EC regulatory framework for Electronic Communications, Oftel has issued a number of consultation documents including one specifically on Financial reporting obligations in SMP markets - A consultation on accounting separation and cost accounting.
It is my intention that the final Financial Reporting in SMP Markets statement will be issued in time to allow me to cease the continued financial reporting obligations in relation to the period going forward from 1 April 2004.
However, the continued financial reporting conditions will remain in place to they extent that they apply to the period ending 31 March 2004.
Accordingly, BT have been informed, that they will be required to prepare Financial Statements under Condition 78 for the financial year 2003 04.
I have set out in this Statement a number of matters that will be discussed further with BT and action taken as necessary in the context of the 2003 04 Financial Statements.
We will also work closely with BT in preparing for the implementation of the new regulatory framework including any transitional implications.
