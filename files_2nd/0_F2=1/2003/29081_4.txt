Schroder Ventures International Investment Trust plc Portfolio Review continued CONCLUSION The performance of the SVIIT portfolio over the year has been encouraging with fully diluted net assets per share increasing by 3%.
SVIIT has reported compound annual growth in net assets per share over five years of 10%, which compares favourably to negative compound capital returns of the FTSE All-Share and FTSE World Index of 4% and 3% respectively.
On the whole, SVIITs portfolio of companies has continued to perform well in difficult economic and operating environments.
Public markets have recovered since their lows of March 2003 and this has had a positive impact on overall EBIT multiples used to value the portfolio, especially in the semi-conductor sector.
In addition, there are signs of an improvement in the environment for exits, with increased activity in the capital markets and signs of renewed interest by trade participants for strategic assets.
SVIITs portfolio of companies is well positioned to benefit from an improved 12 market for investment realisations.
