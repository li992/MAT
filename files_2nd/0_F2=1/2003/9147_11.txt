23 Currency risk To mitigate the effect of currency exposures arising from overseas investments the Group borrows in the local currencies of its main operating subsidiaries.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses to the extent of exchange differences arising on the equity investments.
Matched assets and liabilities are those that generate no gain or loss in the profit and loss account either because they are denominated in the same currency as the Group operations to which they belong or because they qualify under SSAP 20 as a foreign currency borrowing providing a hedge against a foreign equity investment.
At 1 February 2003, there were no material assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of Group companies, having taken into account the effect of forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments that have been utilised to match foreign currency exposures.
At 1 February 2003, the Group also held open various currency swaps and forward contracts that the Group has taken out to hedge expected future foreign currency cash flows see note 27.
Kingfisher plc Annual Accounts 2003 27 Notes to the accounts continued 24 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the Groups gross financial liabilities is as follows: millions 2003 2002 Within one year 746.9 915.2 Between one and two years 173.1 288.9 Between two and five years 1,196.5 94.4 Over five years 157.1 395.0 2,273.6 1,693.5 25 Borrowing facilities At 1 February 2003 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available: millions 2003 2002 Expiring within one year 140.6 32.1 Expiring in more than one year but no more than two years Expiring beyond two years 438.4 720.0 579.0 752.1 26 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a year end comparison of fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments by category.
Where available, mid-market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

com 27 Hedges Derivative financial instruments are accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial cash flow, asset or liability and their gains and losses are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Where such instruments do not hedge an underlying cash flow, asset or liability, they are accounted for using fair value accounting.
The table below details the unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging and the movements therein as follows: At 1 February 2003 Gains Losses Total net millions gains Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 2 February 2002 38.3 5.1 33.2 Gains and losses arising in previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were recognised in the period to 1 February 2003 18.4 0.9 17.5 Gains and losses arising in the previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were not recognised in the period to 1 February 2003 19.9 4.2 15.7 Gains and losses arising in the period ending 1 February 2003 that were not recognised in that period 22.2 35.9 13.7 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 February 2003 42.1 40.1 2.0 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised within one year 12.4 40.1 27.7 Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 29.7 29.7 42.1 40.1 2.0 At 2 February 2002 Gains Losses Total net millions gains Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 3 February 2001 27.8 3.5 24.3 Gains and losses arising in previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were recognised in the period to 2 February 2002 6.7 1.1 5.6 Gains and losses arising in the previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were not recognised in the period to 2 February 2002 21.1 2.4 18.7 Gains and losses arising in the period ending 2 February 2002 that were not recognised in that period 17.2 2.7 14.5 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 2 February 2002 38.3 5.1 33.2 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised within one year 18.4 0.9 17.5 Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 19.9 4.2 15.7 38.3 5.1 33.2 Included within unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 February 2003 are unrealised losses of 33.1m in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts which, at the balance sheet date, hedged projected receipts from the separation of the Groups electricals business.
Following the decision announced subsequent to the year end to effect the separation by demerger rather than by sale or initial public offering, a proportion of the foreign exchange hedge has been closed out at a realised pre-tax loss of 78.8m.
The unrecognised unrealised loss on the remaining hedge of projected receipts on demerger was 41.3m, before tax relief, at the close of business on 15 April 2003.

This provision arises through accounting for the UK pension costs under SSAP 24 see note 33.
The remaining pension provision of 11.0m 2002: 5.9m, relates to overseas pension schemes.
Within the onerous property contracts provision, the Group has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a shortfall and long term idle properties.
The provision is based on the value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
Due to the uncertainty relating to the timing of disposals and the related difficulty in predicting future successes, prudent estimates have been included in the assessment of the provision requirement.
The deferred tax not provided on revalued French and UK properties relates to the tax that would arise net of available reliefs including capital losses if those properties were sold for the revalued amount.
Losses and other timing differences which have not been recognised as deferred tax assets will be recoverable when there are taxable profits available against which they can be relieved.
Deferred tax has been included on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries only where there is an intention to remit these in the foreseeable future.
