DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Any bonus earned in excess of 40% of the maximum opportunity is payable in shares in the Company, which will be deferred for a period of three years: and A malus provision is operated which gives the Remuneration Committee the discretion to reduce lapse unvested deferred shares if an act or omission of the participant contributes to a material misstatement of the Groups financial statements or results in material loss or reputational damage for the Company.
The Directors consider that the future Group profit and ROC targets are matters which are commercially sensitive: they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans and expectations and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
However, the following table sets out the bonus pay-out to the Executive Directors for 2012 13 and Marstons actual Group profit and ROC performance for the period.
Group profit Executive before Director bonus exceptional as a percentage items ROC of salary 2012 13 88.4m 10.7% 0% There was no bonus deferral in 2012 13 as there was no pay-out under the annual bonus scheme.
Annual bonus in 2013 14 No changes are proposed in respect of the annual bonus scheme for 2013 14.
The maximum award under the annual bonus will remain unchanged at 100% of salary with 50% earned for on-target performance.
Performance targets continue to be set at the challenging levels of previous years, with performance based upon Group profit two thirds and ROC one third.
Any bonus earned in excess of 40% of salary will continue to be awarded in deferred shares paid after a further three years.
For the reasons set out above, the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group profit and ROC targets are commercially sensitive and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
However, the Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus pay-out delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
Long Term Incentive Plan Awards vesting in respect of the financial period LTIP awards granted in July 2010 and June 2011 were subject to the achievement of an EPS growth performance condition over a three year period.
Awards vest, on a sliding scale with 35% becoming exercisable if annual EPS growth exceeds RPI by 3%.
For 100% of an award to vest EPS growth must exceed RPI by 9% per annum.
EPS growth over the three year performance period ending 29 September 2012 was less than RPI 3% and the LTIP awards granted in July 2010 lapsed.
The extent to which the LTIP awards granted in June 2011 will vest will not be determined by the Remuneration Committee until June 2014, therefore an estimate of the level of vesting has been made.
On the basis that any formulaic payout does not reflect the Companys assessment of overall business performance for the period it has been assumed that this LTIP award will lapse.

This has prompted the Remuneration Committee to review the efficacy of the incentive arrangements which form part of the Marstons executive remuneration policy.
After extensive consultation with, and good support from, our major shareholders, shareholder approval for a new LTIP is being sought at the AGM.
The key objective for the Remuneration Committee has been to devise a plan which will use appropriate measures consistent with Marstons current strategic objectives: delivery of sustainable growth: increasing ROC and reducing leverage.
The Remuneration Committee has therefore concluded that performance measures for the LTIP should be a combination of Return on Capital, Free Cash Flow, and Relative Total Shareholder Return.
The detailed performance metrics proposed are as follows: Threshold vesting Vesting Maximum vesting % linked at 25% of the at 50% of the at 100% of the to award maximum award maximum award maximum award CROCCE 40% Base 0.25% Base 0.5% Base 1.0% FCF 40% Base 7.5% average Base 15% average Base 30% average growth per annum growth per annum growth per annum Relative TSR 20% Median Upper quintile There will be straight-line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance.
The base amounts will be set at a level that is considered stretching but without encouraging undue risk.

A summary of the key terms of the proposed 2014 LTIP set as a three year cumulative amount based on the budget for rules is set out in the notice of the AGM.
Awards will only be earned if FCF exceeds that cumulative level at the end of three years by Total pension entitlements for defined benefit schemes at least 7.5%.
