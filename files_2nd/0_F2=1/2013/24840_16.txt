The Group has considerable financial resources together with longterm contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
44 H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2013 The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Share Repurchases No shares have been bought back in the year.
The latest authority to purchase Ordinary Shares for cancellation was granted to the Directors on 25 July 2012 and expires on the date of the next Annual General Meeting.
The Directors are proposing that their authority to buy back shares be renewed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Treasury Shares Section 315 of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 allows companies to hold shares acquired by market purchase as treasury shares, rather than having to cancel them.
Up to 10% of the issued shares may be held in treasury and may be subsequently cancelled or sold for cash in the market.
This gives the Company the ability to reissue shares quickly and cost efficiently, thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.
There are current no shares held in treasury.
The Board currently would only authorise the sale of shares from treasury at prices at or above the prevailing net asset value per share plus costs of the relevant sale.
If such a measure were to be implemented, this would result in a positive overall effect on the Companys net asset value.
In the interests of all shareholders, the Board will keep the matter of treasury shares under review.
