Strategic Report Our Goals Our Goals Each year BBA Aviations Executive Management Committee sets a series of short and medium-term goals related to our areas of focus which are then cascaded throughout the Group.
Each business has actions aligned to the achievement of each ofthese specific and measurable goals that support the delivery of the strategy.
The execution of those actions is actively monitored by Group management.
These specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound SMART goals are aligned with our mission statements: Consistently exceeding customer expectations: Valuing and empowering our people in a zero incident, safe environment: Encouraging innovation: Working together for greater gain: Always behaving with integrity and respect.
For competitive reasons we do not disclose the detail of the short and medium-term goals related to these mission statements.
In 2013, we made good progress against our goals but we still have huge potential to push our performance in these areas further.
We continue to make improvements in the underlying operational progress of the Group.
At the beginning of 2013 the Group was reorganised from five businesses into two divisions.
The divisions and their management teams are now well established and the Group is beginning to access further cross-business opportunities through sharing best practice, standardised processes and practices, and optimising management and support structures.
