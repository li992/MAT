Why we exist Within WPP, our clients have access to companies Our mission with all the necessary marketing and To develop and manage talent: communications skills: companies with strong and to apply that talent, distinctive cultures of their own: famous names, throughout the world, many of them.
WPP, the parent company, for the benefit of clients: complements these companies in three distinct ways.
to do so in partnership: First, it relieves them of much administrative to do so with profit.
Financial matters such as planning, budgeting, reporting, control, treasury, tax, mergers, acquisitions, investor relations, legalaffairs and internal audit are co-ordinated centrally.
Second, the parent company encourages and enables operating companies of different disciplines to work together for the benefit of clients.
It also plays an across-the-Group role in the management of talent, property, procurement, IT, knowledge sharing, practice development and sustainability.
And, finally, WPP itself can function as the 21st-century equivalent of the full-service agency.
For some clients, predominantly those with a vast geographical spread and a need for a wide range of marketing services, WPP can act as a portal to provide a single point ofcontact and accountability.

2 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2013 The fast read What we think Grey swans and Chinese innovation by Sir Martin Sorrell 2014 will be tough but manageable.
Clients remain cautious post-Lehman but spending on marketing services should be bolstered by the mini-quadrennial events of the Sochi Winter Olympics, the FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the US mid-term Congressional elections.
Although a number of them have whitened, the grey swans or known unknowns the Eurozones potential fragility, developments in the Middle East, the BRICs hard or soft landing, the US budget and deficit issues, the UK referenda, the crisis in Ukraine and the Sino-Japanese dispute in the East China Sea create ongoing economic uncertainty.
Our business continues its transformation in line with wider societal, behavioural and technological changes.
While so-called traditional media and marketing disciplines remain critically important, Don Draper would hardly recognise as much as 70% of what we do today.
Digital marketing, media investment management and data investment management now account for about $12 billion of our $17.3 billion of revenues.
Strategically, we continue to focus on our four priorities: new markets, new media, datainvestment management and, last but not least, horizontality.
Sir Martin Sorrells article begins on page 93.
Why its Time to Say Goodbye to IKTHTMISOAIW I know that half the money I spend on advertising is wasted by Jeremy Bullmore One of the worlds most widely-held beliefs about advertising is based on a remark, allegedly made a hundred years ago, by one of four men, none of whom may have made it, and which, when examined, makes little sense.
Jeremy Bullmores essay can be read in full on pages 109 to 111.
Four strategic priorities Our goal remains to be the worlds most successful communications services advisor to multinational, regional and local companies.
To that end, we have four core strategic priorities: 1 Increase the share of revenues from faster-growing markets of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, and Central and Eastern Europe to 40-45%.
2 Increase the share of revenues of new media to 40-45%.
3 Maintain the share of more measurable marketing services such as Data Investment Management and direct, digital and interactive at 50% of revenues, with a focus on the application of new technology, big data and digital.
4 Achieve horizontality by ensuring our people work together for the benefit of clients, primarily through two horizontal integrators: Global Client Leaders and Country Managers.
