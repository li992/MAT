Strategic Report: Understanding Our Markets UNDERSTANDING OUR MARKETS Weir operates in three main markets: minerals: oil and gas: and power.
Together, these markets contribute more than 90% of Group revenue.
1 Figure 1: Weir mining sector commodity exposure Minerals Mining sector commodity mix Weir Minerals operates primarily in the global minerals Copper 35% processing sector.
Our equipment and services are Gold 14% applied across the mill circuit, the process by which Iron 11% rock ores are broken down into end commodities such Coal 6% as copper, gold and iron ore. Our largest exposures Phosphate 5% are to those commodities which need the greatest Nickel 4% amount of processing and have the strongest long Alumina 3% term prospects for growth.
See Figure 2 which shows Other minerals 22% forecast copper demand versus supply.
Demand for these commodities comes from the growing world population and the trend towards urbanisation where greater numbers of people move from the countryside to cities.
This is particularly the case in emerging economies.
2 Figure 2: Forecast copper ore demand and supply million tonnes Our original equipment orders are driven by capital expenditure from mining companies.
This can come 4,000 00 in the form of greenfield expenditure on new projects or brownfield spending, where existing assets are 3,600 developed to increase production or efficiencies.
The abrasive process of turning rock into a valuable end commodity means our equipment is exposed 3,200 to significant wear and tear.
This generates aftermarket sales where our products need regular servicing and 2,800 replacement parts.
This process is supported by another trend: global ore grades are in decline which means more processing is needed to produce the same amount of 2013f 2014f 2015f 2016f 2017f raw commodity over time.

4 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Figure 3: US oil production forecast, 20112020 Oil & Gas 3 million barrels per day Weir Oil & Gas operates in the conventional and History 2013 Projections unconventional upstream oil and gas markets, with a 10 niche position supplying specialist pumps to downstream markets.
Our largest exposure is to the North American 8 onshore unconventional market with international unconventional opportunities beginning to emerge.
6 Unconventional drilling involves the extraction of shale oil 4 and gas using hydraulic fracturing where high pressure water, sand and chemicals are used to release gas and oil 2 from rock far below the surface.
We serve these markets in three main ways: pressure control equipment and services to Exploration and Production E&P companies to ensure 2011 2014 2017 2020 drilling, completion and production processes can be 4 Tight Oil 2 onshore Lower 48 offshore carried out efficiently and safely: pressure pumping 5 Others 3 onshore Alaska equipment and services, which provide original equipment to oil and gas service companies for use in hydraulic fracturing fracking : and Weir Oil & Gas services, where dedicated engineering support and spares are provided to both conventional and unconventional markets in Europe Figure 4: World tight gas, shale gas, coalbed methane production 6 and the Middle East.
We also serve mid and downstream excluding US, Canada trillion cubic feet oil and gas markets with products for use in Floating 2013 Production Storage and Offloading FPSO, Liquefied 6 Natural Gas LNG and refining operations.
The main growth driver in these markets is growing global oil and gas demand.
The number of wells drilled 4 determines the level of demand for our equipment.
The intensity and growing complexity of drilling and completion applications leads to strong aftermarket 2 sales.
Our downstream business is primarily influenced by refining activity levels.

OECD Europe China Central and South America High pressure abrasive applications increase Australia New Zealand Middle East Rest of World aftermarket requirements.
Russia Leading service presence in all shale plays: strong customer partnership.
Pump to wellhead capability: broad portfolio provides opportunities in conventional and unconventional markets.
Global manufacturing and service footprint to capture international opportunities.
7 Figure 5: Total world installed generation capacity by source Gigawatts Power Weir Power & Industrial operates in the conventional, 7,000 nuclear and renewables power generation, industrial 6,000 and mid and downstream oil and gas markets.
We serve these markets through the design and manufacture 5,000 of valves, pumps and turbines and the provision of 4,000 specialist support services.
3,000 Growing global energy demand, particularly from 2,000 emerging economies, and the replacement of ageing 1,000 facilities to meet new environmental regulations are the main growth drivers in this market.
The increasing global 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 population dictates the need for new power plants and the refurbishment of existing facilities along with the Coal Liquids Hydro and other renewables development of renewable projects and oilfield Natural gas Nuclear infrastructure development.
