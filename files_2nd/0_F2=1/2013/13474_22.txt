For these reasons, average inventories remained locked in financing deals and therefore unavailable realised prices will not necessarily reflect the movements in any of the publiclyfor physical delivery.
Rio Tinto Uranium also sells predominantly on a longer-term Copper contract basis.
Moreover, there are significant product specification differences between mines.
Sales volumes of all products will vary during the year and the 2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 timing of shipments will also result in differences between average realised Gross sales revenue for the Copper group decreased by 11 per cent in 2013 prices and published prices.
This reflected an eight per cent decline in the copper price during the period, and a 16 per cent decline in the gold price, together 2012 sales revenue compared with 2011 with divestment of the Palabora and Northparkes operations during 2013.
Gross sales revenue in 2012 for the Energy group decreased by 17 per cent compared with 2011 as a result of lower prices.

This was partly offset by increasing volumes from Escondida due to higher grades and Iron Ore improvements to the crushing and conveying circuit and from Northparkes in 2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 line with a recovery in ore grades.
Gross sales revenue for the Iron Ore group increased by seven per cent Diamonds & Minerals compared with 2012, attributable to record sales volumes in the Pilbara and marginally higher prices: and sales volumes increased by five per cent across 2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 the product group.
In 2013, approximately 30 per cent of sales were priced with Gross sales revenue increased by three per cent, largely as the result of reference to a quarterly average index set at the prior quarters average lagged consolidating a full year of sales at Richards Bay Minerals RBM, which offset by one month.
The remainder was sold via pricing mechanisms priced closer to the impact of lower prices for zircon, titanium dioxide feedstocks, borates and the index price at the time of shipment, such as current quarter average, current metallics and lower sales volumes of titanium dioxide feedstocks due to month average or spot index prices.

Sales increased quarter-on-quarter throughout 2012, resulting in 2013 whilst slightly greater volatility was experienced in prices for rough record annual sales volumes despite significant volatility in the marketplace.
Diamond prices realised by Rio Tinto depend on the size and quality of diamonds in the product mix.
2012 sales revenue compared with 2011 Revenues for Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium RTIT increased 41 per cent year-on-year due to higher prices for titanium dioxide feedstocks and the RBM transaction in September 2012, partially offset by the divestment of the talc business on 1 August 2011.
The market for both titanium dioxide and zircon started the year strongly, although demand subsequently softened in the second half.
RTIT continued to replace its multi-year sales contracts with alternative pricing mechanisms in 2012, increasing the exposure to market prices.
