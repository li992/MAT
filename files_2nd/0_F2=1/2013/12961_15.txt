Resources and reserves Resources and reserves Our flagship operation: Having discovered the multimillion ounce Yalea deposit, Randgold built and financed #2 Loulo which started production from two open pit mines in November 2005.
This was followed by the development of the underground mines at the Yalea and Gara deposits.
The Loulo mine, the second largest of its kind in Africa, is now firmly established as a long-life, high-production operation.
Subject to a joint venture agreement see pages 62, 64 and 70 of this annual report for further details.

Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any parts of the companys resources will ever be converted into reserves which qualify as proven and probable reserves for the purposes of the SECs Industry Guide number 7.
