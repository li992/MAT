AXIO Data Group comprises seven market-leading information businesses serving a range of sectors including healthcare, intellectual property licensing, containerised trade and breakbulk services, aviation and forest products.
Its product brands are recognised for quality and authority by the markets they serve and include Vidal, MIMS, TechInsights, JOC and PIERS, Breakbulk, OAG and RISI.

Electra invested 91 million in April 2013 in the 148 million buyout from UBM plc.
The investment is considered attractive by virtue of the diverse, robust and cash-generative nature of the component businesses, the international scope of the groups operations, and the business improvement and growth opportunities.
The entry price represented a significant discount to the potential value of the component businesses.
