The Committee may in exceptional circumstances arising on recruitment, allow a longer period, which would in any event reduce to 12 months following the first year of employment.
Payment for loss of office The Committee will honour directors contractual entitlements.
Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses.
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case.
There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
There is no agreement between the Company and its directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a directors office or employment.
The service agreement for Mr van Beurden, the Chief Executive Officer, was entered into prior to his formal appointment in November 2007 andtherefore existed prior to 27 June 2012.
The service agreement contains a provision, agreed at that time, concerning payment on loss of office.
If the Company terminates Mr van Beurdens employment other than for a reason justifying immediate dismissal, then, as part of the payments owing on termination, a sum equal to the bonus as reported in the most recently preceding annual report of the Company will be paid.
The payment of a bonus on these terms is not part of the Company Remuneration Policy approved as part of this Remuneration Report for new directors nor is this a term in the contracts of any other Executive Director.
