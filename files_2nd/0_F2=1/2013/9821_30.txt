Governance Explanation of performance metrics chosen Performance measures are selected that are aligned to the Companys strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and long term incentive awards.
In setting these stretching performance targets the Committee will take into account a number of different reference points which may include the Companys business plans and strategy and the market environment.
Where relative total shareholder return is used there will be no payment for performance below median compared to the comparator group.
The annual bonus performance targets reflect key financial objectives of the Company and reward for delivery against these.
The LTIP performance targets reflect the Companys strategic objectives and therefore the financial and strategic decisions which ultimately determine the success of the Company.
The LTIP performance measures will be based on financial measures and or share price growth related measures, including but not exclusively : Cash Return On Cash Capital Employed this is a key driver of shareholder value and reflects Marstons investment disposal plans and the Balance Sheet.
Free Cash Flow this reflects the operating cash flow of the business after tax and interest which is available to return to shareholders as dividends: to reinvest to increase returns: or to pay down debt.
Relative Total Shareholder Return aligns managements objectives with those of shareholders and is a broad measure of the extent to which Company strategy is considered appropriate by the market as well as the extent to which it is being well implemented.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance targets and measures where it considers it appropriate to do so for example, to reflect changes in the structure of the business and to assess performance on a fair and consistent basis from year to year.
