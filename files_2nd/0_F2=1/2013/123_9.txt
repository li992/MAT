The can line will more than double our current capacity, initially producing both 330ml and 500ml cans at speeds of up to 120,000 cans per hour.
The logistics facility will replace the operation we currently run through the Eddie Stobart Lutterworth site.
The site has been designed with future expansion in mind with additional space provided which would facilitate a doubling of the initial volume expectations from the site across both manufacturing and logistics.
This is a significant investment which the board believes will support the future growth potential of the business and will allow us to maintain, develop and support the successful business model that we currently operate.
