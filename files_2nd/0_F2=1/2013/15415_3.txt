Through our production facilities across the world, we turn raw materials into distinctive, high-quality ingredients for our customers.
Our ingredients and solutions add taste, texture, nutrition and functionality to products used or consumed by millions of people every day.
Building a platform for future growth: Our vision is to become the leading global provider of speciality food ingredients and solutions.
Over the last three years we have been taking a number of steps to realise this vision through our business transformation programme.
The first part of the transformation, which is now complete, was about realigning and focusing our resources on growing our Speciality Food Ingredients business unit.
The second part is about getting the right enabling platform in place.
We have made good progress including the move to a new operating model comprising two global business units, implementing a global Shared Service Centre and the initial roll-out of our global IS IT system.
Attention is now turning towards growth and we have started to see signs of this coming through, including a significant increase in customer engagement following the opening of our global Commercial and Food Innovation Centre, solid progress in growing the innovation pipeline and launching new products and, increasing our presence in emerging markets.
