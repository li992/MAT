Other internal models help to estimate potential future losses arising from credit, market and other risks, and, using regulatory formulae, the amount of capital required to support them.
In addition, the models enable the Group to gain an enhanced understanding of its risk prole, for example, by identifying potential concentrations and assessing the impact ofportfolio management actions.
Stress testing and scenario analysis are an integral part of capital planning, and are used to ensure that the Groups internal capital adequacy assessment considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on its risk prole and capital position.
They provide an insight into the potential impact of significant adverse events and how these could be mitigated through appropriate management actions.
The capital modelling process is a key part of our managementdiscipline.
A strong governance and process framework is embedded in our capital planning and assessment methodology.
The key capital management committees are the Group Asset and Liability Committee GALCO and the Capital Management Committee CMC.
The members of the GALCO include all theGroup Executive Directors, the Group Chief Risk officer andsenior attendees from Group Treasury, Finance, Risk andthe business.
The GALCO regularly reviews the capital planand approves capital management policies and guidelines.
TheCMC oversees the tactical management of theGroups capital position and provides a bridge to GALCOs strategic management of the Groups capital position.
The GALCO delegates certain authorities to CMC in relation to capital management.
Risk review 129 The Groups capital position, including its relationship to the We apply the Standardised Approach for determining the Groups Risk Appetite Statement, is regularly considered by capital requirements for operational risk.
