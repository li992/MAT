PowerVR ray tracing Ray tracing is a technique for rendering cinema quality 3D at a level of near photographic realism that is impractical with traditional 3D graphics techniques.
Imagination has developed unique and patented technologies to radically lower the cost and dramatically increase the efficiency and performance of ray tracing.
Building on fundamental Imagination IP, such as OpenRL, an open application programming interface API for ray tracing, we are today creating technologies for tomorrows creative graphics professionals.
We are aiming to revolutionize graphics with embedded, mass market ray tracing.
Imagination will use tightly-coupled PowerVR GPU and ray tracing unit RTU technology to drive major innovations in the 3D graphics market.
Our PowerVR RTU technology will be fully integrated with Imaginations future generation of PowerVR GPUs.
