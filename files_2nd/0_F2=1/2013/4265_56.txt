Financial report continued Tax policy The key principles that constitute our Tax Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, are as follows: we are compliant with tax laws and regulations in all territories in which we operate and pay tax in accordance with these laws and regulations: we develop and sustain good and transparent working relationships with tax authorities, government bodies and other relevant third parties: we actively manage our tax affairs, as in all aspects of our business, in such a way as to maximise shareholder value, taking into account not just the immediate fiscal effects, but also longer term considerations including corporate reputation.
Financial control We regularly review the internal control environment, and assess our performance against this with a rolling programme of internal audits, the results of which are shared with the audit committee.
A full explanation of our control environment can be found in the Audit Committee report on pages 63 and 64.
