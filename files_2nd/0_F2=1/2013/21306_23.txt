maximum exposure and its net exposure to credit risk: reflecting the financial effects of collateral, credit enhancements and other actions taken to mitigate the Groups exposure.
For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, maximum exposure to credit risk represents the balance sheet carrying value after allowance for impairment.
For off-balance sheet guarantees, the maximum exposure is the maximum amount that Barclays would have to pay if the guarantees were to be called upon.
For loan commitments and other credit related commitments that are irrevocable over the life of the respective facilities, the maximum exposure is the full amount of the committed facilities.
All disclosures in this section pages 142 to 189 are This and subsequent analyses of credit risk include only financial assets unaudited unless otherwise stated.

As at 31 December 2013, the Groups net exposure to credit risk after taking into account netting and set-off, collateral and risk transfer reduced 8% to 709.8bn, reflecting a reduction in maximum exposure of 11% and a reduction in the level of mitigation held by 14%.
Overall, the extent to which the Group holds mitigation on its assets was stable at 54% 2012: 55%.
Where collateral has been obtained in the event of default, Barclays does not, as a rule, use such assets for its own operations and they are held for sale.
The carrying value of assets held by the Group as at 31 December 2013 as a result of the enforcement of collateral was a 234m 2012: 298m.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Concentrations of credit risk A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
The Group implements certain limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.
The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged.
Further detail on the Groups policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented on page 393.
Geographic concentrations As at 31 December 2013, the geographic concentration of the Groups assets remained broadly consistent with 2012.
The most significant change in concentrations was for cash held at central banks.
A significant reduction in Europe was noted, primarily with the European Central Bank, following the change in composition of the liquidity pool from cash and balances at central banks to government bonds: as a result UK cash contributed a higher proportion of the total.
This also increased holdings in UK, Europe and Americas available for sale debt securities.
An analysis of geographical and industry concentration of Group loans and advances held at amortised cost and at fair value is presented on pages 152 and 153.

The proportion of the overall balance concentrated towards governments and central banks reduced to 12% 2012: 14% primarily driven by the reduction in cash balances held within the liquidity pool.
Home loans now contribute 13% 2012: 11% of the total, due to growth within UK RBB.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Balance sheet credit quality The following tables present the credit quality of Group assets exposed to credit risk.
Basis of preparation For performing loans that are neither past due nor impaired, which form the majority of loans in the portfolios, the following internal measures of credit quality have been used for the purposes of this analysis: Strong there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full, these include investment grade: Satisfactory while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and, therefore, is of no current cause for concern to the Group, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to facilities such as unsecured loans and credit card balances: and Higher risk there is concern over the obligors ability to make payments when due.
However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency.
Non-performing loans loans that are impaired or are past due but not impaired have been included in the Higher risk category for this analysis with prior year comparatives restated to align presentation.
An age analysis of both is presented on pages 155 and 156.
For assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer.
Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies.
The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.
For further information on the way in which Barclays measures the credit quality of its loan portfolios, refer to page 404.
Overview As at 31 December 2013, the proportion of the Groups assets classified as strong remains flat at 83% 2012: 83% of total assets exposed to credit risk.
Traded assets remain mostly investment grade within the strong category, with counterparties to 95% 2012: 94% of total derivative financial instruments, and issuers of 95% 2012: 93% of debt securities held for trading and 96% 2012: 94% of debt securities held available for sale being investment grade.
The credit quality of counterparties to reverse repurchase agreements held at amortised cost remained broadly stable at 76% 2012: 73%.
The credit risk of these assets is significantly reduced due to the high levels of collateralisation held.
In the loan portfolios, 85% of home loans 2012: 82% to customers are measured as strong, The increase in the period reflects the acquisition of the largely strong credit quality portfolio in Barclays Direct during the year and improvements in the UK portfolio.
The majority of credit card, unsecured and other retail lending remained satisfactory, reflecting the unsecured nature of a significant proportion of the balance, comprising 71% of the total 2012: 69%.
The credit quality profile of the Groups wholesale lending improved with counterparties rated strong increasing to 69% 2012: 66 %, primarily due to increases in settlement and collateral balances which are generally rated strong in the Investment Bank.

This was driven by a rise in cash collateral and settlement balances, reflected in lending to other financial institutions, and an increase in home loans in the UK due to increased demand and the acquisition of Barclays Direct.
This was offset by decreases in Africa, due to currency movements, and in Europe, due to the realignment of our target customer profile.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 157 Risk review Credit risk continued Retail credit risk Gross loans and advances to customers and banks in the retail portfolios increased 2% to 236.2bn: principally reflecting movements in UK RBB, where a 6% increase to 138bn reflected the acquisition of Barclays Direct and growth in home loans.
This was partially offset by a reduction in Africa RBB, principally reflecting currency movements.
The loan impairment charge increased 4% to 2,161m principally the result of: UK RBB increased 29% to 347m primarily due to the non-recurrence of releases in 2012 impacting unsecured lending and mortgages.
Excluding these, impairment was broadly in line with prior year: Barclaycard increased 20% to 1,264m primarily driven by higher assets, including the impact of the acquisition of the Edcon portfolio in late 2012, and the non-recurrence of releases in 2012.
Impairment loan loss rates in consumer credit cards remained stable at 356bps 2012: 358bps in the UK and at 268bps 2012: 268bps in the US, but increased to 560bps 2012: 160bps in South Africa: Europe RBB increased 12% to 287m due in part to additional charges resulting from decreases in Spanish government subsidies to the renewable energy sector, foreign currency movements and an increase in home loan balances in recoveries.
This was partially offset by improvements in underlying collections performance: Africa RBB decreased 45% to 259m driven by lower charges in the South African home loans portfolios and foreign currency movements: Wealth and Investment Management increased to 9m 2012: nil driven primarily by losses on Spanish residential property: and Corporate Banking decreased to a 5m release 2012: 27m charge driven by a sharp improvement in residential property values.
Higher overall impairment charges led to an increase in the retail loan loss rate to 91bps 2012: 89bps.

Management adjustments to models for impairment Management adjustments to models for impairment in retail portfolios are applied in order to factor in certain conditions or changes in policy that are not incorporated into the relevant impairment models or to ensure that the impairment allowance reflects all known facts and circumstances at the period end.

Notes a All portfolios under secured home loans are primarily first lien mortgages.
Other secured retail lending under Barclaycard is a second lien mortgage portfolio.
b Other secured retail lending includes vehicle auto finance in Africa RBB and UK secured lending in Barclaycard.
This is primarily driven by Africa RBB and the associated depreciation of ZAR against GBP and the reduction in the recovery book in South Africa home loans.
The reduction in UK RBB reflected higher cash recoveries in Business Banking and lower flows into recovery in Consumer Lending.
The reduction in Barclaycard reflected lower balances in recovery across the principal portfolios.
The CRL decrease was partially offset by higher balances in Europe RBB, primarily due to appreciation of EUR against GBP and an increase in recovery balances across all home loans portfolios.
As a result PCRL balances increased by 3m: CRLs decreased by 99m: and PPLs increased by 102m.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Retail forbearance programmes Forbearance programmes on principal credit cards, overdrafts, unsecured loans, home loans and business lending portfolios Retail forbearance is available to customers experiencing financial difficulties.
Forbearance solutions may take a number of forms depending on the extent of the financial dislocation.
Short term solutions normally focus on temporary reductions to contractual payments and switches from capital and interest payments to interest only.
For customers with longer term financial difficulties, term extensions may be offered, which may also include interest rate concessions and fully amortising balances for card portfolios.
Forbearance on the Groups principal portfolios in the US, UK, Eurozone and South Africa is presented below.

The UK home loans under forbearance programmes decreased 7% to 2,364m.
In H213, the definition was expanded to include customers who are up to date on their mortgage but have either been granted a term extension or have drawn against their Mortgage Current Account and displayed other indicators of financial stress.
2012 forbearance balances were restated from 1,596m to 2,536m in line with the new definition.
As a result of the restatement, Mortgage Current Account balances see page 169 now account for 71% of the total forbearance balances, the majority of the remainder being term extensions which account for 17%.
Total past due balances reduced 14% to 497m due to improved collections procedures.
In South Africa, the reduction in forbearance balances is due to the implementation of enhanced qualification criteria which results in a more appropriate and sustainable programme for the customer, and a depreciation of ZAR against GBP.
In Italy, the majority of the balances relate to specific schemes required by the government, including schemes in response to natural disasters and amendments are primarily payment holidays and interest suspensions.
The decrease of 28% to 307m is in part due to customers exiting such government forbearance schemes after recommencing payments.
The coverage for forbearance accounts remains low, at 3.2% 2012: 1.7% reflecting the underlying quality of customers on these government schemes, with 85% of customers being up-to-date upon entering the forbearance schemes for natural disasters.
Forbearance balances on principal credit cards, overdrafts and unsecured loan portfolios decreased by 9% to 1,160m.
Forbearance programmes as a proportion of outstanding balances reduced in UK and US cards due to better payment rates arising from an improved credit environment.
In UK Cards, Repayment Plans which account for majority of the forbearance balances exit forbearance treatment when they are more than 60 days past due.
The small residual balance reported as 90 days past due relates to accounts that remain on legacy terms and conditions.
Impairment allowances against UK cards forbearance decreased following a review of the qualification criteria in the forbearance policy, the impacts of which became evident from Q2 2013.
This included a reduction of balances on forbearance programmes and better performance resulting in a decrease in impairment coverage ratio.
US cards forbearance programme coverage ratio was lower than the UK due to the nature of the customer mix partnership focused and the type of forbearance, where long-term fully amortising forbearance plans make up over 50% of all forborne accounts.
These plans have lower loss rates compared to the UK and carry lower levels of impairment driven by higher payment success rates compared with the UK.

Non-performing balances increased 13% to 90m, with a significant proportion of customers operating within the terms of their amended terms and conditions.
The relatively low total balances on forbearance coverage ratio of 8.7% 2012: 8.7% for UK business lending EWL managed balances principally reflects focus on obtaining good quality collateral security for secured deals.
Balances in Spain and Portugal increased 55% to 144m primarily due to the restructuring of facilities for EWL managed customers including loans to the renewable energy sector in Spain due to the reduction in government subsidies to this sector.
Impairment coverage increased in Spain reflecting the additional charges taken against loans to the renewable energy sector.

In the UK, gross loans and advances increased 7% to 123bn which includes 5.4bn of balances at acquisition from the Barclays Direct formerly ING Direct mortgage portfolio in February 2013.
Within the total home loans portfolio: d Owner-occupied interest-only balances of 44.5bn 2012: 45.7bn represented 36% of total home loan balances see page 168 for more detail.
The average balance weighted LTV for interest-only balances remained low at 54.2% 2012: 58.8% and 90 day arrears rates remained stable at 30bps 2012: 30bps which was in line with the overall portfolio performance: and e Buy-to-let home loans comprised 8% 2012: 7% of the total balances.
For buy-to-let home loans, 90 day arrears rates improved marginally from 0.2% to 0.1% while balance weighted portfolio LTV remained broadly stable at 62.9% 2012: 65.7%.
Gross loans and advances in South Africa of 12.2bn 2012: 15.8bn were broadly unchanged in local currency.
The improvement in the arrears and charge-off rates was driven by the continued strong performance of new lending and improvements in collections capabilities.
The decrease in recoveries balances was driven by revised strategies in the recoveries environment to reduce this portfolio, and lower charge-off rates.
In the principal European home loans portfolios, gross loans and advances reduced 3% to 31.9bn reflecting the amortisation of existing balances and reduced new business flows following the realignment of our target Europe RBB customer profile see page 14 for further detail.
90 day arrears rates and charge-off rates have remained broadly stable in Spain and Italy, but have reduced in Portugal due to improved collections performance.
Balances in recoveries and recovery impairment coverage rates have increased in Spain in part due to an increase in the legal recovery timescales following introduction of new Spanish mortgage protection laws.
The lengthy legal process in Europe and difficult property market conditions have contributed to the increased recovery balances and higher impairment coverage ratios.

e Buy to let refers to mortgages where the intention of the customer investor was to let the property at origination.
During 2013, the average balanced weighted portfolio LTV in the UK decreased to 56.3% 2012: 59.1% primarily due to appreciating house prices.
For 100% LTV, with the exception of Italy, balances decreased during 2013: In the UK, balances were 41% lower at 1,596m, partly driven by appreciating house prices.
However, the average balance weighted LTV for the same period increased due to the remaining balances having higher LTVs than those paid down: In South Africa, the 49% reduction in the balances to 540m 2012: 1,064m was driven by a reduction in the recoveries book and an appreciation in house prices: In Spain and Portugal, the balances decreased by 24% and 26%, respectively due to the increasing levels of repossessions where the assets are now held as Other Real Estate Owned see page 167 Foreclosures in process and properties in possession : and In Italy, the balances increased by 20% due to the falling property prices and court set auction valuations for properties going through the lengthy repossession process see section Foreclosures in process and properties in possession.
Note a Portfolio marked to market based on the most updated valuation including recoveries balances.
Updated valuations reflect the application of the latest house price index available in the country as at 31 December 2013.
Valuation weighted LTV is the ratio between total outstanding balances and the value of total collateral held against these balances.
Balance weighted LTV approach is derived by calculating individual LTVs at account level and weighting by the individual loan balances to arrive at the average position.

New bookings in Spain, Italy and Portugal reduced 35% to 791m due to changes to business strategy, a tightening of the standard LTV credit criteria and active management to reduce funding mismatch.
Average balance weighted LTV on new mortgages remained stable across these jurisdictions reflecting these credit criteria.
The proportion of new home loans above 85% LTV in Spain has decreased, and now primarily reflects lending to customers to finance the purchase of properties which were previously repossessed by the Bank and held as Other Real Estate Owned see Foreclosures in process and properties in possession below.
Foreclosures in process and properties in possession Foreclosure is the process by which the bank initiates legal action against a customer with the intention of terminating a loan agreement whereby the bank may repossess the property subject to local law and recover amounts it is owed.
This process can be initiated by the bank independent of the impairment treatment and it is therefore possible that the foreclosure process may be initiated while the account is still in Collections delinquent or in Recoveries post charge-off where the customer has not agreed a satisfactory repayment schedule with the bank.
Properties in possession include properties held as Loans and Advances to Customers and properties held as Other Real Estate Owned.
Held as Loans and Advances to Customers UK and Italy refer to the properties where the customer continues to retain legal title but where the bank has enforced the possession order as part of the foreclosure process to allow for the disposal of the asset or the court has ordered the auction of the property.
Held as Other Real Estate Owned South Africa, Spain and Portugal refers to properties where the bank has taken legal ownership of the title as a result of purchase at an auction or similar and treated as Other Real Estate Owned within other assets on the banks balance sheet.
This increase includes customers where contact and formal agreement of payment plans for arrears is still to be achieved.
On average, 22% of customers in foreclosures in process made a monthly repayment which was less than the monthly contractual payment.
31% of customers in Recovery have recommenced full contractual payments as a minimum, and the foreclosure process for these customers are in temporary suspension pending agreement on the arrears.
Notes a The proportion of new home loans above 85% LTV in Portugal includes home loans to restructure customer existing home loans, with no increase in exposure.
b Figures were restated following a detailed review of the LTVs post-migration to a new data management system.
c In Italy, customers continue to retain legal title of the property after the court has ordered an auction.
These are classified as properties in possession and excluded from foreclosures in process.
d In Portugal, properties in possession is based on the number of associated mortgage contracts.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 167 Risk review Credit risk continued The properties in possession portfolio in South Africa is comprised entirely of Other Real Estate Owned.
The reduction in 2013 is due to a more cautious approach adopted for taking ownership of properties at auction when the reserve price is not met, and improved sale processes for existing properties.
Foreclosures in process in the European mortgage portfolios increased driven by the continuing charge-offs.
Foreclosures in process and property in possession stocks are increasing and are impacted by the increasing time to repossess and sell property.
Exposures to interest-only home loans The Group provides interest-only mortgages to customers, mainly in the UK.
Under the terms of these loans, the customer makes payments of interest only for the entire term of the mortgage, although customers may make early repayments of the principal within the terms of their agreement.
Subject to such early repayments, the entire principal remains outstanding until the end of the loan term and the customer is responsible for repaying this on maturity.
The means of repayment may include the sale of the mortgaged property.
Interest-only lending is subject to bespoke underwriting criteria that includes: a maximum size of loan, maximum LTV ratios, affordability and maximum loan term amongst other criteria.
Borrowers on interest-only terms must have a repayment strategy in place to repay the loan at maturity and a customer contact strategy has been developed to ensure ongoing communications are in place with interest-only customers at various points during the term of the mortgage.
The contact strategy is varied dependent on our view of the risk of the customer.
Interest-only mortgages comprise 53bn 2012: 53bn of the total 123bn 2012: 115bn UK home loans portfolio.
Of these, 45bn 2012: 46bn are owner-occupied with the remaining 8bn 2012: 7bn buy-to-let.

The total overall home loans balances for customers who have a current account reserve has reduced by 12% to 72.7bn primarily due to amortising payments on the main mortgage account.
The average marked to market LTV has reduced to 53.9% 2012: 57.7% reflecting increasing house prices and paydown of the main mortgage loan.
Credit cards, overdrafts and unsecured loans The principal portfolios listed below account for 91% 2012: 90% of total credit cards, overdrafts and unsecured loans in the Groups retail portfolios.
With the exception of South Africa cards, arrears rates remained broadly stable.
Notes a South Africa cards now includes the acquired Edcon portfolio in both 2012 reflected partially for a 2 month period and 2013 figures.
The outstanding acquired balances have been excluded from the recoveries impairment coverage ratio on the basis that the portfolio has been recognised on acquisition at fair value during 2012 with no related impairment allowance.
Impairment allowances have been recognised as appropriate where these relate to the period post acquisition.
b The recoveries impairment coverage ratio for Italy salary advance loans is lower than unsecured portfolios as these loans are extended to customers where the repayment is made via a salary deduction at source by qualifying employers often through third-party payment collection companies and Barclays is insured in the event of termination of employment or death.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 169 Risk review Credit risk continued Recovery coverage increased significantly for UK cards, while the proportion of recovery balances was lower.
This was driven by increased debt sale activity which also resulted in a lower recovery expectation across the remaining recovery book, thereby resulting in a higher impairment requirement.
Significant improvement in US cards arrears rates was driven by a targeted strategy focused on growth in high quality customers and low-risk Partnerships.
In the UK personal loans arrears rates reduced due to the improved performance of new bookings following changes to credit criteria.
In South Africa cards, delinquency and charge-off rates deterioration reflected the change in product mix following the acquisition of the Edcon portfolio in late 2012, maturing vintages and portfolio seasoning.
Charge-off rates excluding Edcon would be 4.9% for 2013 2012: 4.2%.
The Italy salary advance loans portfolio was closed to new business in August 2012, and the increasing proportion of outstanding balances in recovery primarily reflects the reduction in loans and advances.
Iberia cards portfolios showed improved arrears rates, notably during the second half of 2013 reflecting the tightening of credit risk strategies through the recessionary period, combined with the non-recurrence of one-off events in 2012 which included challenges in migrating to a new card management system and enhancing some collections tools.
Re-age activity Re-age is applicable only to revolving products where a minimum due payment is required.
Re-age refers to returning of a delinquent account to up-to-date status without collecting the full arrears principal, interest and fees.
The changes in timing of cash flows following re-aging do not result in any additional cost to Barclays.
The following are the principal portfolios in which re-age activity occurs.

The portfolio is managed in two ways: arrears managed and early warning list EWL managed.
Arrears Managed accounts are principally customers with an exposure limit less than 50,000 in the UK and 100,000 in Europe, with processes designed to manage a homogeneous set of assets.
Arrears balances reflect the total balances of accounts which are past due on payments.
EWL Managed accounts are customers that exceed the Arrears Managed limits and are monitored with standard processes that record heightened levels of risk through an EWL grading.
EWL balances comprise of a list of three categories graded in line with the perceived severity of the risk attached to the lending, and can include customers that are up-to-date with contractual payments or subject to forbearance as appropriate.

The reduction in business lending balances in Spain and Portugal was primarily due to the tightening of credit policy and a reduction in new business volumes.
The loan loss rates in Spain increased to 608bps 2012: 210bps due primarily to the impact of changes in the renewable energy sector impacting the cash flow of customers in this sector and the difficult macro environment.
EWL balances in Spain as a percentage of drawn balances reduced significantly following the review of cases and identification of performing assets that were moved to the performing book.
The loan loss rates in Portugal increased to 691bps 2012: 503bps driven by increasing charge-off rates and recovery balances due to the macroeconomic environment.

This reflected currency movements in Africa RBB offset by an increase in Wealth and Investment Management, primarily reflecting growth in the home loans portfolio.
The total loan impairment charge across the wholesale portfolios decreased 27% to 901m principally due to lower charges in Corporate Banking, mainly as a result of lower charges in Europe, reflecting actions to reduce exposure to the Spanish property and construction sectors and, in the UK, against large corporate clients.
Impairment in Investment Bank was 9% higher than 2012 and was principally driven by a charge against a single name exposure in Q2 2013.
Key judgements were made on a number of identified cases within Investment Bank, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management.
No material changes were made to unidentified impairment in 2013.

Forbearance takes place when a concession is made on the contractual terms of a loan in response to an obligors financial difficulties.
Forbearance occurs when Barclays, for reasons relating to the actual or perceived financial difficulty of an obligor, grants a concession below current Barclays standard rates i. e. lending criteria below our current lending terms, that would not normally be considered.
This includes all troubled debt restructures granted below our standard rates but excludes loans that have been renegotiated for commercial reasons that are not indicative of increased credit risk.

Corporate Spain accounted for 42% 2012: 45% of total impairment booked to forbearance exposures.
The overall reduction in forbearance balances was driven primarily by full and partial repayments and balances written off or moved to recoveries.
The 19% reduction in Corporate Banking forbearance was driven primarily by reductions in Spain, which is predominantly property and construction exposure.
This reflects the overall strategic drive to reduce exposure in the Corporate Spain portfolio, including a small number of large write-offs taken as a result of debt sales: Wealth forbearance increased 7% driven by a combination of current EWL cases moving into forbearance, specifically due to a large number of property deals, along with newly reported cases booked in USA, Spain and Jersey.
The increase was partially offset by balance reductions as a result of repayments or cases returned to performing, as well as balances that moving to full legal recovery or being written off in the year: and Reductions in Investment Bank forbearance balances were primarily driven by repayment by clients and the sale of debt assets.

These transactions are generally undertaken under International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA agreements governed by either UK or New York law.
Exposure relating to derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, stock borrowing and loan transactions is calculated using internal PRA approved models.
These are used as the basis to assess both regulatory capital and capital appetite and are managed on a daily basis.
The methodology encompasses all relevant factors to enable the current value to be calculated and the future value to be estimated, for example, current market rates, market volatility and legal documentation including collateral rights.

The CRD IV RWAs of the Exit Quadrant businesses decreased 39.4bn to 54.4bn including reductions of 36.9bn in the Investment Bank.
This reflects reductions in Investment Bank portfolio assets of 21.7bn to 23.5bn, relating to US Residential, Structured Credit Portfolios and optimisation initiatives within the derivatives portfolio.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 181 Risk review Credit risk continued Exposures to Eurozone countries audited Overview The Group recognises the credit and market risk resulting from the ongoing volatility in the Eurozone and continues to monitor events closely while taking coordinated steps to mitigate the risks associated with the challenging economic environment.
Risks associated with a potential partial break-up of the Euro area include: Direct risk arising from sovereign default of an exiting country and the impact on the economy of, and the Groups counterparties in, that country: Indirect risk arising from the subsequent impact on the economy of, and the Groups counterparties in, other Eurozone countries: Indirect risk arising from credit derivatives that reference Eurozone sovereign debt see page 188 : and Direct redenomination risk on the potential mismatch in the currency of the assets and liabilities on balance sheets of the Groups local operations in countries in the Eurozone see page 189.
Contingency planning began in early 2012 based on a series of potential scenarios that might arise from an escalation in the crisis.
Multiple tests have been run throughout 2012 and 2013 to establish the impact on customers, systems, processes and staff in the event of the most plausible scenarios.
Where issues have been identified, appropriate remedial actions have either been completed or are underway.
During 2013 the Groups net on-balance sheet exposures to Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus and Greece reduced by 11% to 53bn.
Exposure to retail customers and corporate clients reduced 17% to 13.0bn: largely reflecting reduced lending in Spain, Italy and Portugal as part of the active management to reduce redenomination risk.
Sovereign exposure decreased 60% to 2.2bn principally due to a reduction in government bonds held as available for sale.
Basis of preparation The Group presents the direct balance sheet exposure to credit and market risk by country, with the totals reflecting allowance for impairment, netting and cash collateral held where appropriate.
Trading and derivatives balances relate to Investment Bank activities, principally as market-maker for government bond positions.
Positions are held at fair value, with daily movements taken through profit and loss: Trading assets and liabilities are presented by issuer type, whereby positions are netted to the extent allowable under IFRS.
Where liability positions exceed asset positions by counterparty type, exposures are presented as nil: Derivative assets and liabilities are presented by counterparty type, whereby positions are netted to the extent allowable under IFRS.
Cash collateral held is then added to give a net credit exposure.
Where liability positions and collateral held exceed asset positions by counterparty type, exposures are presented as nil: and Assets designated at fair value include debt and equity securities, loans and reverse repurchase agreements that have been designated at fair value.
Available for sale investments principally relate to investments in government bonds and other debt securities.
Balances are reported on a fair value basis, with movements in fair value going through other comprehensive income OCI.
a Loans and advances held at amortised cost comprise: i retail lending portfolios, predominantly mortgages secured on residential property: and ii corporate lending portfolios.
Settlement balances and cash collateral are excluded from this analysis.
b Sovereign exposures reflect direct exposures to central and local governments, the majority of which are used for hedging interest rate risk and liquidity purposes.
The remaining portion is actively managed reflecting our role as a leading primary dealer, market maker and liquidity provider to our clients.
Financial institution and corporate exposures reflect the country of operations of the counterparty or issuer depending on the asset class analysed including foreign subsidiaries and without reference to cross-border guarantees.
Retail exposures reflect the country of residence for retail customers and country of operations for business banking customers.
Off-balance sheet exposure consists primarily of undrawn commitments and guarantees issued to third parties on behalf of our corporate clients.
Notes a The Group also enters into reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending, which are materially fully collateralised.
b In addition, the Group held cash with the central banks of these countries totalling 0.2bn as at 31 December 2013 2012: 0.7bn.
Other material balances with central banks are classified within loans to financial institutions.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Summary of Group exposures The following table shows Barclays exposure to Eurozone countries monitored internally as being higher risk and thus being the subject of a particular management focus.
Detailed analysis on these countries is on pages 184 to 187.
Exposures on loans and advances to geographic regions including Europe as a whole are set out on pages 152 and 153.
The net exposure provides the most appropriate measure of the credit risk to which the Group is exposed.
The gross exposure is also presented below, alongside off-balance sheet contingent liabilities and commitments.
Gross exposure reflects total exposures before the effects of economic hedging by way of trading portfolio liabilities, derivative liabilities and cash collateral, but after taking into account impairment allowances and IFRS netting.
This reduction is principally due to a decrease in sovereign exposures by 60% to 2.2bn which was driven by a reduction in Spanish sovereign exposure by 91% to 0.2bn due to the disposal of available for sale government bonds, held for the purpose of interest rate hedging and liquidity, which have been replaced by interest rate swaps with alternative counterparties.
Italian sovereign exposure decreased 42% to 1.6bn principally due to a reduction in government bonds held as available for sale.
Residential mortgage exposure reduced by 4% to 31.4bn, reflecting lower new originations across Spain, Italy and Portugal in line with Group strategy to reduce redenomination risk.
Other retail lending reduced by 6% to 5.9bn driven primarily by reduced lending to business banking customers in Spain and Portugal as a result of the challenging economic conditions.
Corporate exposure reduced 24% to 7.1bn, largely reflecting reduced lending in Spain, Italy and Portugal as part of the active management to reduce redenomination risk.
Exposures to financial institutions increased by 14% to 6.5bn, with increased exposure in Ireland relating to securitised lending offset predominately by reductions in exposures for Spain and Italy.
The exposures for Cyprus and Greece are deemed immaterial to the Group.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 187 Risk review Credit risk continued Analysis of indirect exposures Indirect exposure to sovereigns can arise through a number of different sources, including credit derivatives referencing sovereign debt: guarantees to savings and investment funds which hold sovereign risk: lending to financial institutions who themselves hold exposure to sovereigns and guarantees, implicit or explicit, by the sovereign to the Groups counterparties.
A geographic and industrial analysis of the Groups loans and advances, including lending to European counterparties by type, is set out on pages 152 and 153. Credit derivatives referencing sovereign debt The Group enters into credit mitigation arrangements principally credit default swaps and total return swaps for which the reference asset is government debt.
For Spain, Italy and Portugal, these have the net effect of reducing the Groups exposure in the event of sovereign default.

Credit derivatives referencing sovereign assets are bought and sold to support client transactions and for risk management purposes.
The contract notional amount represents the size of the credit derivative contracts that have been bought or sold, while the fair value represents the change in the value of the reference asset.
The net protection or exposure from credit derivatives in the event of sovereign default amount represents a net purchase or sale of insurance by the Group.
This insurance reduces or increases the Groups total exposure and should be considered alongside the direct exposures disclosed in the preceding pages.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Exposure to Eurozone residential property sector Barclays risk exposure and impairment in Spain and Portugal has been and will be affected by the housing sector in those countries as a result of changes to the banks risk appetite in a declining housing sector, where the desired level of new business has been reduced, and with it, the total exposure.
The 2013 impairment charge to the residential mortgage book in Spain was 42m 2012: 72m and in Portugal was 22m 2012: 24m.
These decreases were principally driven by: Improvement in underlying performance following credit tightening and collections improvements: and A slowdown in the rate of growth in our Loss Given Default, driven by a slowdown in house price deterioration and a one off charge on Spain in 2012 not being repeated.
The impairment charge to our residential mortgage book in Italy increased to 41m 2012: 27m.
However underlying portfolio performance is broadly in line with expectations, with 90 day arrears rates and charge off remaining broadly stable.
For information on our exposures to home loans in Spain, Portugal and Italy see pages 165 to 167.
Eurozone Balance Sheet Redenomination Risk Redenomination risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group should one or more countries exit the Euro, leading to the devaluation of balance sheet assets and liabilities.
The Group is directly exposed to redenomination risk where there is a mismatch between the level of locally denominated assets and liabilities.
Within Barclays, retail banking, corporate banking and wealth management activities in the Eurozone are generally booked locally within each country.
Locally booked customer assets and liabilities, primarily loans and advances to customers and customer deposits, are predominantly denominated in Euros.
The remaining funding needed is met through local funding secured against customer loans and advances, with any residual need funded through the Group.
During 2013, the net funding mismatch decreased 0.2bn to 11.6bn in Italy and 1.1bn to 3.0bn in Portugal.
The surplus in Spain increased 0.8bn to 3.1bn.
Barclays continues to monitor the potential impact of the Eurozone volatility on local balance sheet funding and will consider actions as appropriate to manage the risk.
Direct exposure to Greece is very small with negligible net funding required from Group.
For Ireland there is no local balance sheet funding requirement by the Group as total liabilities in this country exceed total assets.
