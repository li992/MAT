Performance Share Plan PSP For PSP Awards to be made in 2014, the Committee has agreed some adjustments to the EPS and TSR measurements.
The EPS performance range has been widened from RPI 4% 9% p. a. which would be equivalent to 7% 12% p. a. assuming RPI of 3% p. a. to 5% 15% p. a. Vesting at threshold has been reduced from 25% 30% to 25% of maximum.
The Committee believes that nominal EPS growth is simpler and easier to calculate, more visible internally and externally, more salient to overseas participants and reflects the 0 limited relevance of UK retail price inflation to Kellers profits.
The 5% 15% wider range is intended to help mitigate the impact of year-on-year Keller 3-year EPS CAGR p. a. volatility and help ensure awards remain motivational throughout the performance period.
These targets have also been reviewed against Relative TSR vesting schedule analyst estimates, historical performance and EPS performance 50% of award ranges used at other FTSE250 companies.
100% In light of Kellers return to the FTSE250 from the FTSE Small Cap and to reflect better the Companys geographic footprint, the TSR comparator group has also been changed from the FTSE All-Share to the FTSE250 excluding investment trusts for 2014 Awards.
TSR will be calibrated using % outperformance, i. e. Kellers TSR is compared to the FTSE250 Total Return Index, rather than ranked relative to all Index constituents.
This approach is simpler and easier to calculate.
Vesting for performance in line with the index will be reduced from 30% to 25%, rising on a straight-line basis to full 25% vesting if Kellers TSR exceeds that of the FTSE250 by 10% p. a. or more.
This target for full vesting has been determined on the basis of an historical analysis of the median to upper quartile spread and 0 is in line with typical market practice for a company of Kellers size.
