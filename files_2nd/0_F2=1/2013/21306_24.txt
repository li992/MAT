Risk review Market risk Market risk is the risk of a reduction to earnings or capital due to volatility of trading book positions or an inability to hedge the banking book balance sheet.
All disclosures in this section pages 190 to 198 are unaudited unless otherwise stated Introduction This section contains key statistics describing the market risk profile of the bank.
It includes both regulatory and management measures.
This includes risk weighted assets by major business line, as well as Value at Risk VaR measures.
Throughout the section, measures on a regulatory and a management basis are shown.
The market risk management section on pages 405 to 414 provides full descriptions of these metrics.
The Group has seen a significant decrease in market risk, from lower business activities and disposals notably Exit Quadrant assets.
These movements are reflected in a wide range of risk measures within this section.
The relationship between the Groups market risk measures and balance sheet is presented on page 191.
Measures of traded market risk, such as value at risk, decreased in the year due to lower levels of client activity and improved market conditions.
More details are provided on pages 191 to 193.
This translated into lower volatility in daily trading revenue in the Investment Bank, although with lower average daily revenue from 2012 levels.
Market risk RWAs fell from 2012 levels as a result of improving market conditions and general reduction in exposures across the main books.
The section also covers non-traded market risks that mainly occur as a consequence of banking activities other than trading activities: for instance, interest rate risk that arises in the banking book IRRBB.
Annual Earnings at Risk AEaR to interest rate shocks, a key measure of IRRBB, reduced in 2013.
This reduction was predominately driven by changes in the equity structural hedge durations and a change in the hedge ineffectiveness sensitivity.
Other market risks, such as pension risk, are disclosed from page 197 onwards.

Traded market risk review Review of management measures The following disclosures provide details on management measures of market risk.
See page 407 for more detail on management measures and the differences when compared to regulatory measures.
The table below shows the total Investment Bank Management VaR on a diversified basis by risk factor see page 407 for risk factor definitions.
Limits are applied against each risk factor VaR as well as total Management VaR, which are then cascaded further by risk managers to each business.
The Management VaR numbers in the table below include add-ons, to better represent the market risk where the VaR model may not fully represent some risk factors.
See page 408 for a description of risks not in VaR RNIVs.
Average Management VaR reduced in 2013 due to a combination of lower client activity and improved market conditions, notably, tightening of credit spreads.
Market volatility, which was mainly driven by Eurozone in the previous year, improved in 2013 along with general market sentiment, supported by improving macroeconomic trends in developed markets resulting in the review of quantitative easing programmes.
Note a The primary risk factors for banking book assets and liabilities are interest rates and to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates.
Credit spreads and equity prices will also be a factor where the Group holds debt and equity securities respectively, either as Financial Assets Designated at Fair Value see note 14 or as Available for Sale see note 16. barclays.

From average 2012 levels, average VaR for credit risk fell by 8m 31%, interest rate risk fell by 1m 7% and spread risk fell by 12m 52%.
Overall average VaR for the Investment Bank fell by 9m 24%.
Equity risk VaR is the only risk factor that has shown an increase since 2012 as the business supported several key primary market activities over the year as well as increased volume.
The business remained within the Management VaR limits approved by the Board Financial Risk Committee BFRC throughout 2013 for both risk factor VaR and total VaR.
This includes all income generated by Investment Bank except for Private Equity and Principal Investments.
Business performance is discussed in more detail on pages 260 and 261.
The average daily revenue at the Investment Bank in 2013 was 41m, down 11% from 2012, however, there were more positive trading revenue days in 2013 than in 2012, with 97% of days generating positive trading revenue compared to 88% in 2012.
The volatility of income was lower in 2013, in line with the decrease in average Management VaR and lower market volatility.
Note a The high and low VaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole.
Consequently a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.

Due to differences in data sets for market risk and IFRS reporting, whilst assets and liabilities exclude balance sheet line items that would clearly not generate market risk e. g. fixed assets, some line items included e. g. Financial assets designated at fair value could contain assets that do not generate market risk.
Therefore other Investment Bank assets and liabilities contains i business lines that are primarily defined as banking book, and ii line items that should not generate market risk.

Market risks arising from the individual portfolios listed above diversify to provide total Investment Bank management VaR shown on page 192.
Some functions such as Treasury and Client Capital Management shows exposure as a result of the service it provides to the client facing franchise, such as managing the firms exposure to counterparty default or providing funding to execute business.
Some client activities are not within the scope of Management VaR, resulting in the potential diversification not being captured.
On the other hand, Management VaR associated with Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities reflects diversification within that business line.
The primary client facing businesses such as FICC and Equities contribute to the majority of the total balance sheet assets.
The Portfolio Asset Book manages credit exposures, which have been reduced over the year in line with the Exit Quadrant strategy.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 193 Risk review Market risk continued Combined Scenario Stresses As part of Barclays risk management framework, on a regular basis the performance of the trading business in hypothetical scenarios characterised by severe macroeconomic conditions is modelled.
Up to six global scenarios are modelled on a regular basis, for example, a sharp deterioration in liquidity, a slowdown in the global economy, terrorist attacks, global recession and a sovereign peripheral crisis.
Similar to 2012, throughout 2013 the scenarios analysis showed the biggest market risk related impact would be due to a severe deterioration in liquidity and a rapid slowdown in global economy.
Review of regulatory measures The following disclosures provide details on regulatory measures of market risk.
See page 409 for more detail on regulatory measures and the differences when compared to management measures.
Barclays market risk capital requirements comprise two elements: Trading book positions booked to legal entities within the scope of Barclays PRA waiver where the market risk is measured under a PRA approved internal models approach, including Regulatory VaR, Stressed Value at Risk SVaR, Incremental Risk Charge IRC and All Price Risk APR as required: and Trading book positions that do not meet the conditions for inclusion within the approved internal models approach.
Their capital requirement is calculated using standardised rules.
The below table summarises the regulatory market risk measures, under the internal models approach.

Average IRC fell by 59% to 238m 2012: 574m driven by a reduction in exposure to lower rated sovereign positions and a change in directional risk in corporate debt.
Average APR reduced by 34% to 141m 2012: 213m due to an exit of a significant portion of the correlation portfolio.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Non-traded market risk review Net interest income sensitivity The table below shows sensitivity analysis on the pre-tax net interest income for the non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
The sensitivity has been measured using the Annual Earnings at Risk AEaR methodology as described on page 413.
The benchmark interest rate for each currency is set as at 31 December 2013.
The effect of structural hedging is taken into account.
The change in UK RBB was due to a reduction in savings margin compression sensitivity due to additional hedges being transacted and a change in modelling pricing assumptions for Managed Rate Deposits in that they will follow market movements more closely.
The change in Africa RBB was primarily due to exchange rates and a reduction in asset and liability mismatch positions.
The change in Other was a combination of changes in the equity structural hedge durations across GBP, EUR and USD and a change in the hedge ineffectiveness sensitivity driven by increases in hedge positions partly due to the rights issue in 2013.
Banking book exposures held or issued by the Investment Bank are excluded as these are measured and managed using VaR.
AEaR to 100bp shocks decreased for the same reasons as outlined above and is split by currency in the table below.

196 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Foreign exchange risk audited The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk.
a Transactional foreign currency exposure Transactional foreign exchange exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity.
The Groups risk management policies prevent the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside the trading portfolio managed by the Investment Bank which is monitored through DVaR.
There were no material net transactional foreign currency exposures outside the trading portfolio during 2013 or 2012.
Due to the low level of non-trading exposures no reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates would have a material effect on either the Groups profit or movements in equity for either of the years ended 31 December 2013 or 2012. b Translational foreign exchange exposure The Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies principally US Dollar, Euro and South African Rand.
Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.
The Groups strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by using the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital movements to broadly match the revaluation of the Groups foreign currency RWA exposures.
During 2013, total structural currency exposures net of hedging instruments remained stable at 16.2bn 2012: 15.7bn.
The economic hedges primarily represent the US Dollar and Euro preference shares and additional Tier 1 instruments that are held as equity, accounted for at historic cost under IFRS and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.

The other material overseas schemes are in South Africa and the US where they represent approximately 5% and 2% respectively of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
As such, this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF.
Pension risk arises because the estimated market value of the pension fund assets might decline: or the investment returns might reduce: or the estimated value of the pension liabilities might increase.
See page 198 for more information on how pension risk is managed.
Assets The Board of Trustees defines an overall long-term investment strategy for the UKRF, with investments across a broad range of asset classes.
This ensures an appropriate mix of return seeking assets to generate future returns as well as liability matching assets to better match the future pension obligations.
The main market risks within the asset portfolio are against interest rates and equities, as shown by the analysis of scheme assets within Note 37.
Fair value of UKRF plan assets increased by 4% to 23.7bn 2012: 22.8bn, driven by equities on the back of an equities rally.
However, equities risk within the portfolio was relatively unchanged as its percentage against the rest of the portfolio remained stable.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 197 Risk review Market risk continued Liabilities The retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19R basis these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long term inflation rate and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve : An increase in long term inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities An increase in the discount rate corresponds to a decrease in liabilities Pension risk is generated through the Groups defined benefits schemes and this risk is deemed to move to zero over time as the chart below shows.
The chart below outline the shape of the uninflated liability cashflow profile with the majority of the cash flows approximately 75% falling between 0 and 40 years, peaking within the 21 to 30 year band and reducing thereafter.
The shape may vary depending on changes in inflation expectation and mortality and it is updated in line with Triennial Valuation process.
For more detail on liability assumptions see note 37.
Proportion of liability cashflows 0-10 years 11-20 years 21-30 years 31-40 years 41-50 years 51 years Risk measurement In line with Barclays risk management framework, the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility of the pension positions on a total portfolio level.
This ensures that the risks, diversification benefits and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations and investments are adequately captured.
VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis at the pension risk fora such as the Market Risk Committee, Pension Management Group and Pensions Executive Board.
The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities based on an IAS 19R basis see note 37.
The Trustees, via their consultants Towers Watson, receive quarterly VaR measures on a Funding basis.
In addition to this, the impact of Pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process.
Stress testing is performed internally at least on an annual basis, covering scenario such as European economic crisis and quantitative easing.
The UKRF exposure is also included as part of the regulatory stress tests and exercises indicated the UKRF risk profile is resilient to severe stress events.
Unlike traded market risk, the capital requirement for pension risk is not reflected in risk weighted assets.
Instead, the calculation is applied as a deduction from capital resources which has a similar effect on capital ratios.
Triennial valuation The last triennial valuation was started with an effective date of 30 September 2010.
In compliance with the Pensions Act 2004, the current valuation is being carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2013.
During 2014, the Bank and Trustees will agree a scheme-specific fund.
