Annual Report 2013 Polymetal International plc Strategic report 56 57 Strategic report Financial review Highlights market summary Precious metals Revenue in 2013 decreased by 8% to US$1,707 million compared to 2012 year-on-year as a result of average realised gold The year 2013 witnessed significant fluctuations in the precious metals markets, with a reversal of a positive trend that and silver prices decreasing 19% and 28% respectively year-on-year.
This unprecedented price decline was to a significant had dominated since 2009.
In the first quarter, markets were generally stable, with the gold price fluctuating in the range extent offset by 14% growth in the volume of gold equivalent sold.
However, in the middle of April gold witnessed one of the sharpest daily and weekly declines of the 1 Group Total cash cost was US$745 per gold equivalent ounce GE oz, up 8% compared to the 2012 level.
Cash costs were past decade, decreasing to US$1,378 oz, and then further dropping to US$1,192 oz by the end of June.
This steep decline negatively affected by the elevated level of unit costs and lower recoveries during the ramp-up at the Amursk POX facility and was prompted by significant reductions in ETF holdings and other investment demand sources, and the plans by the US Federal at the newly launched Mayskoye mine, while the mature mines demonstrated resilient cost performance.
Total cash costs Reserve to gradually decrease the amount of monetary stimulus to the US economy.
Later in the year, the gold price fluctuated in the second half of the year declined by 8% versus the first half of 2013 to US$721 GE oz driven by operational improvements between US$1,193 oz and US$1,420 oz, ending the year at US$1,202 oz on the back of the above-mentioned investor demand at the Albazino Amursk, where cash costs declined by 27% half-on-half to US$707 GE oz, and Omolon, where as a result factors, offset by a record level of consumer demand, especially from China and India.
As a result, the average LBMA gold price of mine plan revision a 32% cash cost reduction to US$756 GE oz was achieved.
for the period decreased 16% year-on-year.
Silver price dynamics followed gold with an increased level of volatility, dropping 1 All-in sustaining cash costs comprised US$1,086 GE oz and increased slightly by 3% year-on-year, driven mostly by an from US$30.9 oz as at 1 January 2013 to US$19.5 oz as at 31 December 2013.
This has also resulted in a further reduction increase in total cash costs during the period, which was largely offset by production growth and reduction of per ounce in the gold silver price ratio.
The average gold silver price ratio decreased from 1 54 in 2012 to 1 59 in 2013, while sustaining capital and exploration expenditure at our operating mines.
Adjusted EBITDA was US$598 million, a decrease of 36%, driven mainly by a decline in commodity prices.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, compared to 50% in 2012.
Precious metals market summary A non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of US$366 million resulting from the decline in gold and silver prices was recorded Gold Silver Gold silver as at 31 December 2013, mainly due to the write-off of goodwill and mining assets at Varvara, Khakanja and low-grade ore Gold price, US$ oz Silver price, US$ oz, and gold silver price ratio stockpiles at Omolon.
The post-tax amount recorded was US$315 million.
The impairment calculations were performed 1,800 70.0 using conservative price assumptions of US$1,200 oz for gold and US$18 oz for silver, which are meaningfully below current 1,600 60.0 spot prices.

Among the mature mines, sales generally followed production dynamics Consumables and spare parts Services Labour and gold silver ratio price movements.
Other expenses Purchase of ore from third parties Mining tax Changes in accounting policies and basis of estimates 2013 Application of IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine IFRIC 20 provides guidance on the accounting for the costs of stripping activities during the production phase of a mine.
286 305 180 5 33 109 919 When the benefit from the stripping activity is improved access to a component of the ore body in future periods, the stripping costs in excess of the average ore-to-waste ratio for the life-of-mine of that component are recognised as a non-current asset.
IFRIC 20 became effective for the Group from 1 January 2013.
2012 Prior to adoption of IFRIC 20, the Groups accounting policy was not to capitalise stripping costs during the production phase.
260 284 148 7 33 121 852 Therefore, as at 1 January 2012 there were no stripping assets on the Groups balance sheet.
The adoption of IFRIC 20 has resulted in the capitalisation of certain stripping costs and a reduction in the cost of sales and inventory recorded in 2012.
The stripping assets recognised as a result of the application of IFRIC 20 will also affect the level of depreciation charges in future periods.
See details in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
Total cash costs, adjusted EBITDA and Total cost of sales grew by 32% in 2013 to US$1,124 million, mainly on the back of volume-based growth in production and other non-GAAP metrics have been restated accordingly.
The capitalised stripping costs in 2013 comprised US$91 million sales 21% and 14% year-on-year respectively in gold equivalent terms.
Other cost drivers include domestic inflation in Russia compared to US$61 million in 2012 and were mainly represented by Omolon, Khakanja and Varvara.
6.5% in 2013, which was only partially offset by Rouble depreciation, and a significant increase in depreciation charges as a result of the launch and ramp-up of the Mayskoye concentrator and the Amursk POX plant, which are now both Use of JORC reserves for depreciation calculation in commercial production.
From 1 January 2013, the Group began to use JORC as opposed to GKZ reserves as the basis for unit-of-production depreciation calculations, as management believes this revised basis better reflects the long-term mine plans, which The cost of consumables and spare parts and the cost of services grew by 10% and 7% respectively, with most of the growth are also being prepared based on JORC reserves estimates.
Specific cost increases in the period are attributable to consumables and spare parts at the Amursk POX, which was fully operational during the year and displayed elevated consumption rates due to limited throughput and recovery The increase in profit for the period due to the adoption of IFRIC 20 was almost entirely offset by the change in depreciation during the ramp-up process.
Amursk POX was the main driver of increased smelting costs during the period.
The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2013 was US$180 million, a 22% increase mainly stemming from Cost of sales production volume growth, increase in the rates of payroll tax for highly paid employees, and growth in the average number % of employees at Amursk and Mayskoye which are now fully in commercial production.

None of the options vested in June 2013, as the performance conditions excess of price over strike price of US$16.74 per share were not met.
Further, in March 2014 the majority of employees waived their rights under the Old EIP in order to be able to participate in the new Long-Term Incentive Plan the New LTIP.
However, the expense previously recognised does not reverse as a credit to the income statement in accordance with IFRS rules as the non-vesting is related to a market-based condition.
Should any remaining options vest in June 2014 at the revised target share price US$18.75 per share, no additional expense will be recognised in the income statement.
