2 Operating profits are determined on the basis of including longer-term investment returns.
EEV and IFRS operating profits are stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns against long-term assumptions, gain on dilution of Groups holdings, the costs arising from the domestication of the Hong Kong business, loss profit attaching to held for sale Japan life insurance business and, in 2010, costs associated with the terminated AIA transaction.
Separately, on the IFRS basis, operating profit also excludes amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments.
In addition, for EEV basis results, operating profit excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions, the market value movement on core borrowings and, in 2012, the gain arising on the acquisition of REALIC.
3 Asia comparative APE new business sales prior to 2011 exclude the Japanese insurance operations, which ceased writing new business from 15 February 2010.
4 Funds under management comprise funds of the Group held in the statement of financial position and external funds that are managed by Prudential asset management operations.

It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets: ii Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses: iii With-profits business represents the shareholders transfer from the with-profits fund in the year: iv Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality, morbidity and persistency: v Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses: vi Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the year attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs which are not included in the segment profit for insurance, as well as items that are more appropriately included in other source of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate : and vii DAC adjustments comprises DAC amortisation for the year, excluding amounts related to short-term fluctuations, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.

ii The analysis excludes the results of the held for sale life insurance business of Japan.
The results of Japan life business excluded in 2013 were: profit of 3 million 2012: loss of 2 million.
iii The Group has adopted new accounting standards on joint arrangements, as described in note A2.
The only impact of the resulting change on the analysis above is to deduct the associated tax expense from the joint ventures operating profit by treating it as an administration expense.
This contributed to an additional expense, as follows: Long-term business 2013: 5 million 2012: 9 million : and Asset management business 2013: 8 million 2012: 6 million.
All other lines continue to include the Groups share of the relevant part of the joint ventures pre-tax operating profit.

Analysis of Asia operating profit drivers Spread income has increased by 22 million from 93 million in 2012 to 115 million in 2013, an increase of 24 per cent, predominantly reflecting the growth of the Asian non-linked policyholder liabilities.
Fee income has increased from 141 million in 2012 to 154 million in 2013, broadly in line with the increase in movement in average unit-linked liabilities.
Insurance margin has increased by 90 million from 589 million in 2012 to 679 million in 2013, predominantly reflecting the continued growth of the in-force book, which contains a relatively high proportion of risk-based products and management action on claims controls and pricing.
Insurance margin includes non-recurring items of 52 million 2012: 48 million, reflecting items that are not expected to reoccur in the future.
Margin on revenues has increased by 123 million from 1,439 million in 2012 to 1,562 million in 2013, primarily reflecting the higher premium income recognised in the year.
Acquisition costs have increased from 903 million in 2012 to 1,015 million in 2013, in line with the 12 per cent increase in sales, resulting in a stable acquisition cost ratio.
The analysis above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE.
If with-profits sales were excluded from the denominator the acquisition cost ratio would become 65 per cent 2012: 63 per cent reflecting changes to product and country mix.
Administration expenses have increased from 570 million in 2012 to 634 million in 2013 as the business continues to expand.
The administration expense ratio remains broadly in line with prior periods at 300 basis points 2012: 306 basis points.

Average liabilities used to calculate the administrative expense margin exclude the REALIC liabilities reinsured to third parties prior to the acquisition by Jackson.
Analysis of US operating profit drivers Spread income has increased by 4 per cent to 730 million in 2013 from 702 million in 2012.
The reported spread margin increased to 246 basis points from 239 basis points in 2012, primarily as a result of lower crediting rates.
In addition, spread income benefited from swap transactions previously entered into to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration.
Excluding this effect, the spread margin would have been 182 basis points 2012: 186 basis points.
Fee income has increased by 34 per cent to 1,172 million in 2013, compared to 875 million in 2012, primarily due to higher average separate account balances due to positive net cash flows from variable annuity business and market appreciation.
Fee income margin has remained broadly consistent with the prior year at 196 basis points 2012: 199 basis points, with the decrease primarily attributable to the change in the mix of business.
Insurance margin represents operating profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Positive net flows into variable annuity business with life contingent and other guarantee fees, coupled with a benefit in the year from re-pricing actions, have increased the insurance margin from 399 million in 2012 to 588 million in 2013.
This includes a benefit due to the inclusion of the full year of operations for REALIC, which contributed 188 million in 2013, compared to 87 million in 2012.
Acquisition costs, which are commissions and expenses incurred to acquire new business, including those that are not deferrable, have decreased by 58 million compared to 2012, due largely to the discontinuation of certain policy enhancement options on annuity business.
As a percentage of APE, acquisition costs have decreased to 58 per cent for 2013, compared to 66 per cent in 2012.
This is due to the discontinuation of contract enhancements mentioned above and the continued increase in producers selecting asset-based commissions which are treated as an administrative expense in this analysis, rather than front end commissions.
Administration expenses increased to 670 million during 2013 compared to 537 million in 2012, primarily as a result of higher assetbased commissions paid on the larger 2013 separate account balance.
Asset-based commissions are paid upon policy anniversary dates and are treated as an administration expense in this analysis, as opposed to a cost of acquisition and are offset by higher fee income.
Excluding the trail commissions previously mentioned, the resulting administration expense ratio would be lower at 44 basis points 2012: 48 basis points, reflecting the benefits of operational leverage.
DAC adjustments decreased to 313 million in 2013 compared to 442 million in 2012, due to lower levels of current year acquisition costs being deferred and higher DAC amortisation being incurred following higher gross profits.
Certain acquisition costs are not fully deferrable, resulting in new business strain of 198 million for 2013 2012: 174 million mainly reflecting the increase in sales in the period.

Analysis of UK operating profit drivers Spread income has reduced from 266 million in 2012 to 228 million in 2013, principally due to lower annuity sales in the year.
Fee income has increased in line with the increase in unit-linked liabilities.
With-profits income has decreased by 21 million from 272 million in 2012 to 251 million in 2013, principally due to a 50 basis point reduction in annual bonus rates.
This has contributed to the reduction in the with-profits margin from 33 basis points in 2012 to 30 basis points in 2013.
Insurance margin has increased from 39 million in 2012 to 89 million in 2013.
This increase arises from our improved profits from our protection business, the non-recurrence of the 2012 effect of strengthening longevity assumptions on our annuity book and 27 million positive impact of undertaking a longevity swap on certain aspects of the UKs annuity back-book liabilities in the first half of 2013.
Margin on revenues represents premium charges for expenses and other sundry net income received by the UK.
2013 income was 187 million, 29 million lower than in 2012, reflecting lower premium volumes in the year.
Acquisition costs as a percentage of new business sales are in line with 2012 at 15 per cent.
Lower commission payments from the implementation of the recommendations of the Retail Distribution Review have been more than offset by the effect of lower bulk annuity sales in the year, which traditionally are less capital intensive.
The ratio above expresses the percentage of shareholder acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE sales.
It is, therefore, impacted by the level of with-profit sales in the year.
Acquisition costs as a percentage of shareholder-backed new business sales were 32 per cent in 2013 2012: 33 per cent.
Administration expenses at 124 million are 4 million lower than for 2012 due to lower project spend in the first half of the year.
Expected return on shareholder assets has increased from 107 million in 2012 to 134 million in 2013, principally due to improved investment returns in the year and higher surplus assets.

Notes i Analysis of operating profit between new and in-force business The result for insurance operations comprises amounts in respect of new business and business in force as follows: 2013 m 2012 m New business strain 15 46 Business in force 974 860 note ii Non-recurrent items: Other non-recurrent items 44 48 Gain on sale of stake in China Life Taiwan 51 Total 1,003 913 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.
The IFRS new business strain corresponds to approximately 1 per cent of new business APE premiums for 2013 2012: approximately 2 per cent of new business APE.
The improvement is driven by a shift in overall sales mix to lower strain products and countries.
The strain reflects the aggregate of the pre-tax regulatory basis strain to net worth after IFRS adjustments for deferral of acquisition costs and deferred income where appropriate.
ii During 2012, the Group sold its 7.74 per cent stake in China Life Taiwan for 97 million crystallising a gain of 51 million.
Other non-recurrent items of 44 million in 2013 2012: 48 million represent a small number of items that are not anticipated to re-occur in subsequent years.
iii To facilitate comparisons of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns that reflect the Groups retained operations, the results attributable to the held for sale Japan life business are not included within the long-term business operating profit for Asia.
The 2012 comparative results have also been adjusted.
The Japan life business contributed a profit of 3 million in 2013 2012: loss of 2 million.

Although a small amount less than 2 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown in the tables is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2013, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2013 over the same 40 year period.
In particular, it excludes the value of the shareholders interest in the estate.
It also excludes any free surplus emerging after 2053.
Following its classification as held for sale, the Asia cash flows exclude any cash flows in respect of Japan.
The above amounts can be reconciled to the new business amounts as follows: 2013 m New business Asia US UK Total Undiscounted expected free surplus generation for years 2014 to 2053 3,340 1,515 658 5,513 Less: discount effect 2,098 516 397 3,011 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2014 to 2053 1,242 999 261 2,502 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2053 52 2 54 Less: free surplus investment in new business 310 298 29 637 Other items 155 5 3 163 Post-tax EEV new business profit 1,139 706 237 2,082 Tax 321 380 60 761 Pre-tax EEV new business profit 1,460 1,086 297 2,843 Other items represent the impact of the time value of options and guarantees on new business, foreign exchange effects and other non-modelled items.
Foreign exchange effects arise as EEV new business profit amounts are translated at average exchange rates and the expected free surplus generation uses year end closing rates.

The amounts shown above for non-operating and other movements include the effects of a partial hedge of the future shareholder transfers expected to emerge from the UKs with-profits sub-fund that was transacted in 2013.
This hedge reduces the risk arising from equity market declines for the years 2014-2018.
However, in rising equity markets as assumed in preparing the EEV results, the hedge reduces the projected free surplus benefit of those higher returns.
Consistent with this feature, for 2014 the expected free surplus generation compared to that expected at 31 December 2012 is reduced by 58 million as a result of this hedge.
At 31 December 2013, the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years years 2014 to 2018 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as underpin our embedded value reporting was 10.1 billion, an increase of 1.5 billion from the 8.6 billion expected over the same period at the end of 2012.
This increase primarily reflects the new business written in 2013, which is expected to generate 1,357 million of free surplus over the next five years.
Operating, non-operating and other items are expected to increase free surplus generation by 570 million over the next five years, but this has been offset by adverse foreign exchange movements of 389 million.
At 31 December 2013, the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next forty years is 43.5 billion, up from the 35 billion expected at end of 2012, reflecting the effect of new business written and the positive market movements in Asia, following increases in bond yields principally in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore, together with higher projected separate account fees following increase in US equities values.
The foreign exchange translation effect arising across US and Asia operations is a reduction of 1.6 billion.
The overall growth in the undiscounted value of free surplus, reflects both our ability to write new business on attractive economics and to manage the in-force book for value, as well as the positive gearing of our cash flows to rising long-term yields and equity markets.
Actual underlying free surplus generated in 2013 from life business in force at the end of 2012 was 2.6 billion inclusive of 0.5 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.
This compares with the expected 2013 realisation at the end of 2012 of 2.0 billion.
See note 4 of the EEV basis results section for further details.
These relate to items where there is no definitive timeframe for when the payments will be made or receipts received and are, consequently, excluded from the amounts incorporated into the tables above showing the expected generation of free surplus from in-force business at 31 December 2013.

III f  Following provisional agreement on the Omnibus II Directive on 13 November 2013, Solvency II is now expected to come into force on 1 January 2016.
Therefore, our economic capital results are based on outputs from our Solvency II internal model.
Although the Solvency II and Omnibus II Directives, together with draft Level 2 Delegated Acts provide a viable framework for the calculation of Solvency II results, there remain material areas of uncertainty and in many areas the methodology and assumptions are subject to review and approval by the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Groups lead regulator.
We do not expect to submit our Solvency II internal model to the Prudential Regulation Authority for approval until 2015 and, therefore, the economic capital results shown below should not be interpreted as outputs from an approved Solvency II internal model.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had an economic capital surplus of 11.3 billion and an economic solvency ratio of 257 per cent before taking into account the 2013 final dividend.
A summary of the capital position is shown in the table below: bn Economic capital position 31December2013 note Available capital 18.5 Economic Capital Requirement 7.2 Surplus 11.3  257% Note Based on the Groups Solvency II internal model which has not been reviewed or approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority.
Additional information Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 355 These results are based on outputs from our current Solvency II internal model, assessed against a draft set of rules and with a number of key working assumptions.
Further explanation of the underlying methodology and assumptions are set out in the sections below.
By disclosing economic capital information at this stage, the directors of Prudential plc are seeking to provide an indication of the potential outcome of Solvency II based on the Groups current interpretation of the draft rules.
An update of the capital position will be reported annually going forwards and will evolve to reflect changes to the Solvency II rules, ongoing refinements to our internal model calibrations, and feedback from the Prudential Regulation Authority on Prudentials approach to implementing this new capital regime.
Against this background of uncertainty, it is possible that the final outcome of Solvency II could result in a fall in the Group solvency ratio, relative to the results shown above.
Methodology In line with Solvency II, for the Groups European and Asia life business, and holding companies, the available capital is the value of assets in excess of liabilities.
The key components of available capital are the market value of assets, insurance technical provisions calculated as the sum of best estimate liabilities plus a risk margin and other liabilities.
Subordinated debt forms part of available capital, rather than being treated as a liability, since this debt is subordinated to policyholder claims.
As a general principle, both assets and liabilities are recognised at the value at which they could theoretically be transferred to a third party in an arms length transaction.
On the asset side of the balance sheet, assets are mostly held at IFRS fair value.
However, adjustments are required to IFRS values to eliminate intangible items such as goodwill and deferred acquisition costs and to take account of economic assets which are excluded from the current IFRS balance sheet such as the present value of future with-profits shareholder transfers.
The best estimate liability is calculated by taking the average of future risk-adjusted best estimate cash flows, taking into account the time value of money and the relative liquidity of those liabilities.
The best estimate liability allows for the value of options and guarantees embedded in existing contracts as well as the value of future discretionary benefits payable to policyholders.
Realistic management actions and policyholder behaviour are allowed for where relevant.
In addition, since capital requirements are only derived to cover risks over a one year horizon, a risk margin is added to the best estimate liability to cover the cost of ceding liabilities to a third party after one year, assuming a 6 per cent per annum cost of capital, in line with Solvency II requirements.
The Economic Capital Requirement measures the potential reduction in the value of available capital over a one year time horizon, in an adverse 1-in-200 probability event, consistently with the Solvency II Directive.
This allows for diversification effects between different risk types and between entities.
No restrictions on the economic value of overseas surplus have been allowed for in assessing the capital position at Group level.
Prudentials US insurance entities are included in the economic capital position on a local RBC basis under the assumption of US equivalence and the assumed permitted use of the deduction and aggregation method.
This is in line with our view of the most likely outcome of Solvency II given the agreement reached in the Omnibus II Directive.
The contribution of US insurance entities to the Group surplus is that in excess of 250 per cent of the US RBC Company Action Level, which is in line with the level at which we measure both the Groups IGD surplus and the Groups reported free surplus amount.
In line with the draft Solvency II requirements under the deduction and aggregation method, no diversification benefit is allowed for between US insurance entities and other parts of the Group.
The contribution of Japan to the Group surplus has been set equal to the held for sale accounting value of 48 million, pending completion of the sale.
The impact of the domestication of the Hong Kong branch, which became effective on 1 January 2014, is not allowed for in these economic capital results, but is estimated to have a negative impact on the Group solvency ratio of -4 percentage points, mainly due to a loss of diversification in the risk margin following separation of the Hong Kong business into a subsidiary.
Consistently with evolving Solvency II requirements, the Group calculation also includes all non-insurance entities, including asset management companies, Prudential Capital and holding companies, as follows: Asset managers are included in line with existing sectoral capital rules, and Prudential Capital is included on a Basel basis, which follows the expected Solvency II treatment: Defined benefit pension schemes are included using international accounting standards and, in addition, a capital requirement is added: and Holding companies are measured on a Solvency II basis, as if they were insurance companies, in line with draft Solvency II rules.
In addition to the assumption of US equivalence, and without applying restrictions to the economic value of overseas surplus, other key elements of Prudentials methodology relating to areas that are presently unclear in the draft Solvency II rules, and which are likely to evolve as more detailed requirements are clarified, relate to: i The liability discount rate for UK annuities, which is currently set by applying a liquidity premium in addition to the risk-free rate.
This liquidity premium addition reflects the long-term buy-and-hold nature of the assets backing UK annuity liabilities, which are, therefore, not directly exposed to changes in market credit spreads, but instead to long-term default risk over the term of the assets.
This liquidity premium will be replaced with the corresponding Solvency II Matching Adjustment when the rules and interpretation relating to this Solvency II calculation are clarified: ii The impact of transitional arrangements on technical provisions, for which no allowance has been made in the economic capital position, but which may apply under Solvency II although the use of this transitional is subject to regulatory approval and the extent to which it is permitted is likely to depend on the final Solvency II capital position : and iii The credit risk adjustment to the risk-free rate, which is currently set at 10 basis points, consistent with the specification in Quantitative Impact Study 5, but where discussions are ongoing at a European level as part of the process to agree the more detailed Solvency II rules.
Further, current drafts of the Solvency II rules remain unclear in relation to capital tiering requirements and, therefore, tiering limits are not yet applied.
Prudentials methodology in the areas highlighted above will evolve in the future as the final Solvency II requirements become clearer.
In addition, there are a range of other calibration issues which will remain unclear until Solvency II requirements have been finalised and our Solvency II internal model has been reviewed and approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority.
Therefore, the capital position may change as methodology is refined in the lead up to 2016 when Solvency II is expected to formally replace the current IGD regime.
356 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Additional information Additional unaudited financial information Additional unaudited financial information continued III:  Assumptions The key assumptions required for the economic capital calibration are: i Assumptions used to derive non-market related best estimate liability cash flows, which are based on EEV best estimate assumptions: ii Assumptions used to derive market related best estimate liability cash flows, which are based on market data at the valuation date where this data is reliable and comes from a deep and liquid market, or on appropriate extrapolation methodologies where markets are not sufficiently liquid to be reliable: iii Assumptions underlying the calculation of the best estimate liability in respect of dynamic management actions and policyholder behaviour: iv Assumptions underlying the risk models used to calculate the 1-in-200 level capital requirements for the Economic Capital Requirement which are set using a combination of historic market, demographic and operating experience data and expert judgement: and v Assumptions on the dependencies between risks, which are calibrated using a combination of historic data and expert judgement.
The risk-free curve at which best estimate liability cash flows are discounted is based on market swap rates with the exception of Vietnam where no liquid swap market exists and government bond yields are therefore used, with a deduction of 10 basis points to allow for a credit risk adjustment to swap rates.
In addition, a liquidity premium is added to the liability discount rate for UK annuities, in both the base balance sheet and in the stressed conditions underlying the Economic Capital Requirement.
In the absence of a Matching Adjustment calibration, the liquidity premium has been derived by reference to existing Solvency I allowances and a range of other industry benchmarks.
The allowances vary by fund reflecting the nature of the respective asset portfolios and the extent of asset-liability cash flow matching, which are also likely to be key inputs into the Solvency II Matching Adjustment calculation.
The resulting liquidity premium allowances are summarised in the table below.
The final Solvency II discount curve is subject to considerable uncertainties and may vary significantly from these assumptions.

The key differences between the two metrics are: 0.6 billion represents the adjustment required to the Groups shareholders funds in order to convert Jacksons contribution from an IFRS basis to the local statutory valuation basis which underpins the US Risk Based Capital regime: 2.7 billion due to the removal of DAC and goodwill from the IFRS balance sheet: 3.8 billion due to the addition of subordinated debt which is treated as available capital on an economic basis but as a liability under IFRS: 5.8 billion due to differences in insurance valuation requirements between economic capital and IFRS, with available capital partially capturing the economic value of in-force business which is excluded from IFRS, offset to some extent by the inclusion of a risk margin which is not required under IFRS: 4.1 billion due to the inclusion of the value of future shareholder transfers from with-profits business on the economic balance sheet in the UK and Asia, which is excluded from the determination of the Groups IFRS shareholders funds: and 1.3 billion due to the impact on the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the other valuation differences noted above.

During 2013, the Groups economic capital surplus increased from 8.8 billion to 11.3 billion.
The total movement over the year was equivalent to a 42 percentage point increase in the Group economic solvency ratio, driven by: Model changes: a positive impact to Group surplus arising from a number of modelling enhancements and refinements: Operating experience: generated by in-force business, new business written in 2013, the beneficial impact of management actions taken during 2013 to fide-risk the business, and small impacts from non-market assumption changes and non-market experience variances over the year: Non-operating experience: mainly arising from positive market experience during 2013: and Other capital movements: a reduction in surplus from the acquisition of Thanachart Life and the preparation for sale of the Japanese business, the negative impact of exchange rate movements, an increase in surplus from new subordinated debt issuances and a reduction in surplus due to dividend payments in 2013.

358 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Additional information Additional unaudited financial information Additional unaudited financial information continued III:  The Groups most material risk exposures are to financial markets, in particular to equities and credit spreads, which we hold to generate a higher return on capital over the long term.
The Group also has material insurance risk exposures including longevity risk from UK annuities, lapse risk across a wide range of products, and mortality and morbidity risk mainly arising from protection products written in Asia.
These risks diversify strongly with market risks, even after allowing for market-related policyholder behaviour, thereby, increasing the return on capital which can be earned from the balanced mix of risks.
A brief description of the most material risks is set out below: The Groups exposure to equities mainly arises from UK shareholder transfers linked to policyholder funds partially offset by economic equity hedges and from future fund management charges on unit-linked funds in Asia.
The equity exposure arising from Jacksons variable annuity business is mostly hedge: The Group also has significant exposure to credit risk, mainly from the UK annuity portfolio and from Jacksons fixed annuity credit portfolio.
Credit exposures across the Group are carefully monitored and managed as part of the Groups risk management framework: The Group is exposed to movements in yields interest rates, while falling interest rates increase the risks arising from policyholder guarantees in with-profits funds and variable annuities, falling interest rates also increase the value of future insurance profits: The most material insurance risk exposures arise from UK longevity risk, and lapse, mortality and morbidity risk in Asia: and The Group is also exposed to expense and operational risk, which is closely monitored and managed through internal control processes.
 Stress testing the economic capital position gives the following results as at 31 December 2013 : An instantaneous 20 per cent fall in equity markets would reduce surplus by 0.3 billion but increase the economic solvency ratio to 260 per cent: An instantaneous 40 per cent fall in equity markets would reduce surplus by 1.0 billion but increase the economic solvency ratio to 258 per cent: A 100 basis points reduction in interest rates subject to a floor of zero would reduce surplus by 1.3 billion and reduce the economic solvency ratio to 225 per cent: A 100 basis points increase in interest rates would increase surplus by 0.8 billion and increase the economic solvency ratio to 284 per cent: and 2 A 100 basis points increase in credit spreads would reduce surplus by 1.3 billion and reduce the economic solvency ratio to 254 per cent.
These sensitivity results demonstrate the resilience of the economic capital position following large falls in equity markets, sizeable reductions in yields and a severe credit event.
The adverse impact of falling equity markets mainly results from a reduction in the value of with-profits shareholder transfers and future fund management charges in the UK and Asia.
Equity hedging reduces the impact of these exposures and a dynamic equity hedging programme is also in place to manage the equity risk arising in Jacksons variable annuities business.
A fall in yields has a material adverse impact on Group surplus which largely arises from a decrease in the value of future with-profits shareholder transfers and an increase in the size of risk margins.
Falling yields also increases the value of the Groups external debt, reducing the Group surplus.
However, these impacts are partially offset by an increase in the value of future insurance profits and changes in the value of hedging assets.
Widening credit spreads adversely impacts on the annuity business in the UK since this is deemed to represent an increase, to some extent, in the expected level of future defaults.
Jackson is not exposed to credit spread widening on a US RBC basis, but an increase in defaults in the Jackson credit book would have a negative impact on the Group capital position and is reflected in the credit stress test above.
 The methodology, assumptions and overall result have been subject to examination by KPMG LLP.
Note 2 For the credit spread widening stress 10 times expected defaults are assumed for Jackson since credit spread movements do not directly impact on the US RBC result.
