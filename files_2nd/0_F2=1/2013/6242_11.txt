Irrespective, Fresnillo plc has long been amongst the top three global the precious metals industry.
producers of silver, both by-product and primary, and we aim to maintain our leadership position amongst global producers.
In gold we benchmark our performance against mediumsized global gold miners with similar annual production.
The precious metals market Our performance and that of our peers is driven by the price of precious metals and ultimately the supply and demand dynamics that drive those prices.
The extent to which we monitor metal price movements and market dynamics, using primarily third party analyses and forecasts, is to support our financial projections and cash management strategies rather than operational decision-making.
