Financial report continued Other items In 2013, following the announcement that we were no longer investing in further development of certain camera products, we impaired $76.9 million in respect of goodwill and fixed assets allocated to the cameras cash generating unit CGu.
For further details see pages 10 and 21.
In 2012, we recognised a $127.2 million profit on the Samsung Transaction.
Further details of this transaction, including the possible adjustment to consideration, can be found on page 22 and note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating result Our IFRS operating loss for 2013 was $48.4 million, compared to an operating profit of $107.9 million in 2012.
This reduction in profitability was mainly due to: the 2013 non-cash impairment of $76.9 million in the Cameras CGU: profit from the Samsung Transaction increasing the 2012 result by $127.2 million: and lower 2013 Legacy revenue following the Samsung Transaction which gave rise to a $13.8 million reduction in gross profit.
These were offset by a $61.6 million reduction in SG&A and R&D costs primarily due to lower headcount, and savings on litigation and restructuring costs.
All of these items are explained more fully above.
The IFRS operating margin for 2013 was a loss of 5% for 2013, compared to a profit of 10.5% in 2012. underlying operating profit was $104.3 million in 2013, compared to $74.0 million in 2012.
This increase was mostly driven by the reduction in SG&A and R&D costs discussed on page 25. underlying operating margin was 10.9% compared to 7.2% in 2012.
Investment income and finance costs Investment income primarily represents the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and treasury deposits which averaged $302.4 million during 2013 2012 $320.7 million.
The 2012 average was higher due to the elapsed time between receiving cash from the Samsung Transaction in October 2012, and the cash outflows arising from the return of capital to shareholders in 2012.
Investment income on these assets fell to $0.9 million 2012 $1.2 million due to a fall in market interest rates, and the lower average of cash held.
Finance costs in 2013 include a $1.2 million change in valuation of our equity investments whilst finance costs in 2012 were inflated due to the costs of hedging the tender offer in November 2012.
A breakdown of finance costs can be found in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Taxation The tax credit for 2013 was $6.1 million, compared to a charge of $50.7 million in 2012.
This results in an effective tax rate of 11.6% for the year 2012: 49.8%.
The rate is lower than the average uK statutory rate of 23.25% due primarily to the non-deductibility for tax purposes of the Camera impairment, although this was offset in part by the release of historic provisions relating to the former Zoran operations.
The higher tax rate for 2012 was driven by a high tax rate on the disposal of our handset connectivity and handset location business to Samsung due primarily to the non-deductibility of the goodwill written off on disposal.
The underlying effective tax rate for 2013 was 20.3%, which differed from the rate of 23.25% due mainly to reductions from uS R&D tax credits and the uK Patent Box, combined with the release of provisions following the successful conclusion of audits by various tax authorities, counterbalanced by the impact of non-recognition of trading tax losses in Israel.
The underlying effective tax rate excludes the tax impacts of items not included within our underlying profit before tax measure.
It also excludes the impact of tax rate changes on our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes to deferred tax assets due to additional loss or other temporary difference recognition or fide-recognition.
Result for the period For the 2013 financial year we recorded a loss for the period of $46.3 million, compared to a profit of $51.2 million in 2012.
This reduction in profitability is mainly due to the reduction in operating profit in the year, and taxation movements, as explained above.
We recorded an underlying profit for 2013 financial year of $81.1 million, compared to $55.4 million in 2012, reflecting the improvement in underlying operating profit and reduction in taxation costs as explained above.
Earnings per share Basic and diluted losses per ordinary share were $0.28 and $0.28 respectively in 2013, compared to basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share of $0.26 and $0.25 in 2012. underlying diluted earnings per ordinary share was $0.46 in 2013 and $0.27 in 2012.
The main factors leading to these movements were the change in profitability for the period, as described in the paragraphs above and the reduction in the number of outstanding ordinary shares following the share buybacks undertaken in 2013 which are explained on page 85.
