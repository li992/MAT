Strategic Report Group performance and development Introduction We continue to make significant 2013 has seen Hunting deliver another set of solid financial results.
While a number of investments in new manufacturing our operations experienced reduced equipment and facilities, positioning activity levels in particular within our Well Construction division, which was ourselves with the capability to meet restrained by customers unwinding anticipated market demand for our inventory overall our performance has achieved a year of modest growth.
With confidence in the long-term growth of our industry, we continue to make significant investments in new manufacturing equipment and facilities, positioning ourselves with the capability to meet anticipated market demand for our extensive product portfolio.
Peter Rose Dennis Proctor Our plans remain focused on expansion and Finance Director Chief Executive growth with some of our key statistics reflecting the current scale and reach of our operations: 2.8 million square feet of manufacturing floor space, in 41 manufacturing facilities with 1,104 machines supported by 34 service and distribution points.
We have a physical presence in 12 countries with nearly 4,000 employees.
Overview As expected, 2013 began slowly and was followed by a stronger performance in the second half, reflecting prevailing market conditions within the industry, which gave rise to mixed demand levels across the geographic regions.
Activity levels in the US remained healthy and overall footage drilled was up 5% year on year, supported by the continued recovery in the Gulf of Mexico.
Hunting revenues increased by 2% in line with US drilling and completion spend.
Our Premium Connections, Titan and Subsea businesses performed particularly well but these results were offset by a decline in the AMG businesses which suffered from customer destocking.
Trading in Canada remained difficult with adverse weather and structural supply issues impacting the market.
"Despite the expansion of Titan in Canada, revenues from this region fell by 22% principally due to weakness in Oil Country Tubular Goods ""OCTG"" related business."

24 Hunting PLC 2013 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Strategic Report Wireline operations have a key role to play in well intervention.
Tools and equipment are run into the well using a cable to perform tasks such as reservoir evaluation, stimulation or tool recovery.
Pressure control is essential, as the wireline passes through a valve containing a series of rams designed to close over the cable in the case of an emergency.
Pressure control For wireline operations the integrity of the valve is paramount to safely manage the pressure differentials as the well bore is entered.
A rugged design for field work and ease of use by the operator are the desired outcomes.
In order to meet these requirements Huntings engineers are constantly seeking to refine the product range to simplify it and make it more efficient.
Born from a specific customer demand, the engineering team designed the Eziclose hydraulic actuator, which also allows rams to be manually closed over the wireline at any well pressure up to 10,000psi.
Retro-fittable to the existing Hunting wireline valve body design, finite element analysis was used to lower Eziclose quad valve customised for optional manual weight and reduce parts without operation.
