14 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Business Review Wholesale The Wholesale division comprises wholesale, franchise and licence arrangements as well as trade sales but excludes e-commerce sales.
The division delivered external revenue of 117.9m, up 7.4% 2012: 109.8m, representing 33% of total Group revenue 2012: 35%.
Operating profit in the year was 37.1m 2012: 31.8m, whilst underlying operating profit was 35.6m 2012: 31.4m.
The improvement in operating margin of 160 basis points reflects gross margin accretion that has been generated across the Group, driven by sourcing gains through better buying, currency gains, and increased operating income.
This is offset in part by: a higher level of marketing spend, an increase in the bad debt provision and costs associated with operating the international showroom at Regent Street.
