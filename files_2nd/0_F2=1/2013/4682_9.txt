The rate of injuries requiring treatment The number of working days lost during How we did in 2013 by a health professional recordable the year declined again: Safety performance at Devro injuries reduced in 2013: continues to improve.
We measure our Number of lost working days performance by looking at the number Recordable injury rate per million hours worked of recordable injuries, those which injuries per million hours worked need more attention than basic first aid and require the attention of a health professional.
There was a marked improvement in our recordable injury rate in 2013.
The reported rate of lost working day injuries LWDIs increased in the past year, but the severity of incidents continues to decline.
Following every LWDI a full report is drafted with all remedial actions put in place as soon as is practical, with the circumstances shared at all sites to ensure the chance Lost working day injury rate of recurrence elsewhere in the group is injuries per million hours worked minimised.
The Chief Executive meets personally with every colleague who has been involved in a LWDI.
The number of working days lost due to injury in 2013 was at the lowest level since 2000, when Devro started keeping records of safety statistics.
Whilst there has been considerable progress in safety over the past 9 years, there is still scope for further improvement.
Managers and all colleagues remain committed to making Devro a safe place to work.
We take pride in what we do and we are committed to complying with the regulations, permits and consent limits that apply to our various activities, just as we are committed to avoiding pollution and reducing our environmental impact in the countries and communities in which we operate.
Devros operations around the world are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes and cultures.
As a consequence, we deal with environmental issues through a network of specialists operating within the business units.
The main environmental impacts of our processes are the emission of carbon dioxide and the solid waste we send to landfill or incineration.
We operate our own waste water treatment plants in three of our locations.
In the fourth, Scotland, we discharge directly into the public sewerage system where our waste is combined with domestic effluent and treated by Scottish Water.
We monitor three measures at group level: carbon dioxide CO emissions 2 from the use of fuels and electricity in our factories water consumption solid waste to landfill or incineration Our major concern is climate change and the twin issues of fuel consumption and electricity-related CO emissions.
2 In 2011 we set ourselves the target of making 10% reductions in each of these measures per  by 2015.

Our Czech factory in Jilemnice sends liquid effluent to the Jizerka River, and our US factory in South Carolina discharges to the Congaree River.
The effluent from both has to meet a range of limits: and across both sites there were only three minor incidents where consented levels were exceeded but all were quickly remedied.
