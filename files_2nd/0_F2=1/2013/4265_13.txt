Measuring our performance KPIs Using KPIs to monitor strategic performance Our strategy is to deliver growing shareholder returns by generating revenue growth and increasing profitability.
We seek to do this by focusing our investment on markets that are fast growing and where we can deliver differentiated platforms with a leading market position.
using this summary we have identified the key strategic objectives, and use KPIs to monitor progress against these as explained in the table below.
Key Strategic Objectives How we measure our performance For further information see Increasing profitability underlying operating profit Pages 16 and 17 Headcount by region Focus on fast growing markets Revenue growth Pages 17 and 18 Gross margin growth Page 18 Deliver differentiated platforms Grow shareholder returns underlying EPS Pages 18 and 19 Working capital days KPIs are used by management to track business performance over time, to understand general trends, and to consider whether we are meeting our strategic objectives.
We review our KPIs and adapt them as appropriate, in response to how our business and strategy evolves.
The most recent review was undertaken during 2013 and reflects our new business structure after the Samsung Transaction, and the more recent announcement about discontinuing investment in the Cameras business line.
Following this review, our KPIs have been revised to ensure that the relationship between these measures and our strategy is clear: KPIs on days outstanding and inventory turns are now included in our working capital days KPI, which also includes information on how we manage our supplier payment terms.
We believe this best represents the funds available to return to shareholders and therefore we use this as an alternative to a KPI on free cash flow: we have added new KPIs relating to the monitoring of underlying operating profit and the Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR of the Total Addressable Markets TAM of our focus areas: previously reported KPIs on average cost per employee and operating expenses by function are no longer disclosed, as management do not use these when making business decisions.
Increasing profitability We believe that delivering increased profitability requires continual oversight of costs incurred in the operation of the business.
CSR aims to increase profitability before tax by growing margins while maintaining a level of operational costs which are proportionate and necessary to support the business.
We measure our success at this strategic action through two KPIs.
Underlying operating profit We use this KPI to ensure we maintain the balance between gross margin and operational costs.
underlying operating profit represents profits from our underlying operations excluding certain irregular or non-cash items that we believe do not represent our ongoing business activity.
This is fully defined on pages 150 to 151.
For the purposes of executive remuneration we measure this profit against the budgeted value as described on page 71.
For the purposes of monitoring business performance we review underlying operating profit as a proportion of revenue underlying operating profit margin, so we can measure and compare year-on-year trends.
We target to achieve underlying profit margins in the mid-teens.
indb 16 11 03 2014 21:17 % CSR in review Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information During 2013 underlying operating profit margin increased to 10.9% due to a change in product mix generated a higher gross margin due to the greater proportion of Voice & Music products sold.
Products from this segment have strong gross margin as explained on page 23: the reduction in our operating cost base following restructuring activities that occurred over the last two years as explained on pages 25, 30 and 31: and reduction in 2013 revenue following the 2012 Samsung Transaction, and shrinkage in the Cameras market as consumers continue to switch to smartphones.
As this is the denominator in the calculation, reduction in turnover causes the underlying operating profit margin to increase.
Headcount The development and delivery of innovative technologies is possible through the contribution of our people, operating in various territories across the world.
Within CSR, the majority of the operational cost arises directly from the number of employees and their locations.
We closely monitor the profile of our employees by region to ensure we have an appropriate presence to support our business, suppliers and customers.
Headcount by region as at period end date 3000 868 2500 2000 716 609 857 1500 801 463 468 711 1000 1120 1045 962 290 500 275 362 463 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Asia US Europe We aim to maintain over 40% of our workforce in Asia where there is a plentiful supply of talented engineers and where many of our key growth markets are located.
In 2013 the percentage of employees based in Asia declined to 45% as we continued to withdraw from Legacy Home Entertainment and Handset markets.
uK-based resource increased over the same period as we established a new office of Wi-Fi experts in Bristol, and recruited specialists in Bluetooth low energy.
The restructuring relating to our decision to discontinue investment in future Camera products will see a number of employees leave the business in 2014, particularly in Asia.
However the impact on regional headcount is likely to be offset by our targeted recruitment plan, which is part of our increased investment in strategic technologies.
Focus on fast growing markets As described on pages 9 and 11 we focus our investment in five high growth-markets.
We monitor the markets where we invest to help us understand the developing trends in each of these markets and to allocate resources where we believe the best opportunities for growth lie.
We also monitor our own increase in revenue to track internal growth against that of our target markets.
Revenue growth We measure growth in both our total and Core revenue to understand whether we are achieving appropriate levels of growth in our focused investment areas.
Our Core businesses represent those areas where we continue to invest, and is an aggregate of the Voice & Music, Auto and Consumer reporting segments.
As explained on page 71, growth in total revenue compared to the Annual Plan is also used as a measure within the Executive Incentive Plan.
We target to achieve year-on-year growth in Core revenue.
For 2014 we target to see revenue growth in Core revenue.
but expect to see a reduction in total revenue as our Legacy businesses reach their end of life.

For 2013 our Core business, which was not impacted by this transaction, has grown by 9% year-on-year.
This was primarily due to strong growth in volumes and prices in our Voice & Music and Auto business lines as further explained on page 23. www.
indb 17 11 03 2014 21:17 $ millions Measuring our performance KPIs continued Deliver differentiated platforms An important part of our strategy is to be able to offer customer solutions which combine a number of differentiated technologies into a single product, which we call a platform.
This can be technically complex to achieve, but allows us to provide our customers with differentiated solutions from those of our suppliers, and to therefore charge higher selling prices and, as a result to generate improved gross margins.
Gross margin Movement in gross margin is an indication whether we are increasing the proportion of our business derived from platforms and whether our strategy to increase our business in this area is proving successful.
We monitor both total gross margin, and that element that relates to the underlying gross margin allocated to our Core Business.
We believe that Core underlying gross margin best represents the ongoing profitability of the business and, in particular, best provides a comparable year-on-year trend.
The Core business is the aggregate of all business lines where we continue to invest and the underlying gross margin excludes the effect of any accounting adjustments arising from acquisitions for a full definition see page 151.
IFRS gross margin follows the same trends and also includes the impact of amortisation on intangible assets acquired during historic acquisitions.
In our operating model we target gross margins in the range of 55-60%.

Additionally, the IFRS gross margin also grew as low margin legacy products are now a smaller proportion of the total business.
A full description of these drivers can be found on pages 23 and 24.
Grow shareholder returns We aim to grow returns to our shareholders.
In recent years, this has been achieved through a combination of growth in the earnings per ordinary share, our progressive dividend policy and returns of capital through share buybacks.
We maximise the funds available for these returns through working capital management and measure our success at this strategic action with the following two KPIs: Underlying earnings per share EPS This KPI represents the loss or profit for the period that we deliver as defined on page 151 as a proportion of our existing and dilutive shares.
We use underlying profit after tax as we believe it best represents the ongoing performance and profitability of the Group.
We target year-on-year growth in underlying EPS across a long-range planning period.
2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 underlying EPS $ 0.23 0.43 0.20 0.27 0.46 The increased underlying EPS in 2013 represents the increased profitability of the Group, as described on page 26, as well as a reduction in share volume following the cumulative impacts of ordinary share buybacks in 2012 and 2013.
Working capital days The Company takes a disciplined approach to the allocation of the available capital resources and closely monitors how the business generates and utilises cash.
Working capital days measures the cash used in our day-to-day business operations, which is therefore not available for distribution.
It represents the aggregate of: the number of days it takes to collect cash from customers days sales outstanding : the number of days we hold finished goods and raw materials as inventory inventory days : and the credit terms we have arranged with our suppliers creditor days.

indb 18 11 03 2014 21:17 % CSR in review Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information We calculate creditor and inventory days on an annualized basis, however due to our credit terms we believe it is more appropriate to calculate days sales outstanding based on revenue from the previous 2 month period.
On this basis, we target overall working capital days of 65 days or less.
2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Inventory days 81 74 104 64 59 Days sales outstanding 40 40 40 39 37 Creditors days 61 49 46 44 37 Working capital days 60 65 98 59 59 In 2013 the total working capital days in aggregate remained broadly consistent with those for the prior year.
As we stop manufacturing Legacy product lines, this consolidation of product range means we hold less buffer stock, reducing inventory days.
We continue to focus on ensuring we hold the optimum balance of inventory to meet customer demands whilst minimising cost and inventory risk.
Days sales outstanding fell slightly due to a change in the mix of customers as we reduce sales volumes from handset products, and increase the sales to Voice & Music customers who traditionally have shorter credit terms.
Raw materials purchased have longer credit terms than non-raw material suppliers.
As our raw material spend reduces in line with revenue, we therefore see a reduction in the average outstanding creditor days.
