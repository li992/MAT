TH TH SIGMA SHAR E GROU E GROUP C P C ES OM OMP PANY ANY Sigma Shares Sigma Shares conversion Sigma Shares were converted to Ordinary share on 17 December 2012.
In November 2012, the company published a Shareholder Circular setting out a proposal to convert the Sigma shares into Ordinary shares and combine the underlying portfolios.
The Board was aware of investors increased focus on liquidity and the trend for wealth managers to invest their clients monies in companies with larger market capitalisations.
The advice the Board had received was that for many wealth management groups, companies with a market capitalisation of less than 100 million would not be considered for investment.
This view was endorsed by the AICs subsequent publication on liquidity in the Investment Company sector.
The resolution to convert the Sigma shares to Ordinary shares was carried overwhelmingly at the EGM of the company held on 14 December 2012.
Shares were converted based on the Net Asset Values of the respective share classes as at the close of business on 12 December and the new Ordinary shares were admitted to the Official list for trading at 8.00am on 17 December.
Based on the NAV of the Sigma and Ordinary share classes on an AIC basis with debt marked to market on the Calculation Date of 12th December 2012, and taking into account the conversion charge of two per cent to the NAV of the Sigma Pool as at the date of conversion and the deduction of 0.48% of costs relating to the conversion, the Conversion NAV per Ordinary share was 201.48 pence per share and the Conversion NAV per Sigma share was 100.19 pence.
Accordingly, every Sigma Share was converted into 0.4973 Ordinary shares.
Fractions of Ordinary shares were not issued: fractional entitlements were rounded down to the nearest number of Ordinary shares.
