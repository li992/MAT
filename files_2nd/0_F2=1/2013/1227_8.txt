Medical device companies are working on sensors that can monitor vital signs and create alerts if outside normal parameters.
Some of these devices are implanted or ingested so they can monitor internal levels of chemicals and hormones.
ARM-based chips can be small and energy-efficient and therefore can reduce the overall costs, power consumption and intrusiveness of such devices.
These smart sensors are not just useful for valuable livestock, but can help people too.
More information about embedded ARM-based devices can be found onpage 36 and also online.
