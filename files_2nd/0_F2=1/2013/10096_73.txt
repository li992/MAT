Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee does not formally consult with employees as part of its process when determining Executive Director pay.
However the Committee is kept informed of general decisions made in relation to employee pay and related issues by the Group HR Director and is conscious of the importance of ensuring that its pay decisions for Executive Directors are regarded as fair and reasonable within the business.
As outlined in the Policy Table, pay and conditions in the Group are one of the specific considerations taken into account when the Committee is determining salary levels for the Executive Directors.
Consideration of shareholders views The Companys three major shareholders each had a representative on the Committee in the pre-Listing period and, accordingly, the structure of our post-Listing remuneration policy has been subject to significant consultation with them.
In addition we have sought the views of our largest institutional shareholders and leading advisory bodies post Listing.
