ABOUT THE INVESTMENT ADVISER John Laing Capital Management Limited JLCM, a wholly owned subsidiary of John Laing, acts as the Investment Adviser to the Company and as the Operator of the Partnership.
JLCM was incorporated in England and Wales on 19 May 2004 under the Companies Act 1985 registered number 5132286 and is authorised and regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE 2.1 Share Price Analysis JLIFs share price has steadily risen over the year, increasing from 107.9 pence at the end of 2012, Avon & Somerset Courts peaking at 122.7 pence cumulative of dividend in August 2013 and nishing the year at 115.2 pence.
The chart below sets out JLIFs share price over the year and compares this against the net redemption yield of a basket of UK long-dated gilts.
In theory, as investors in JLIF assess the shares against gilts, when gilt yields rise, JLIFs share price might be expected to fall.
This pattern is evident in the early part of the year but towards the latter part of the year this theory was unproven.

This was further accentuated when JLIF formally announced the terms of the capital raise to repay the debt drawn to finance the acquisition of the IIC portfolio, which represented 40.0% of the Companys share capital at the time.
The issue closed in October, raising gross proceeds of 242.3 million through the slightly oversubscribed issue of 218.3 million new shares at the top of the price range at 111.0 pence.
The shares have traded above that level since then.
This was JLIFs largest capital raise since IPO in 2010.
Set against the wider market, JLIFs share price has again remained relatively stable and the Company continues to pay a level of income welcomed by investors.
From launch in November 2010 to the end of December 2013, JLIF has delivered total shareholder returns of 32.7%, and an annualised return of 9.6%.

4 Foreign exchange As at 31 December 2013 the Portfolio included five projects that have exposure to foreign exchange cash ows being the Canadian Dollar CAD and the Euro.
These projects with non-Sterling denominated cash ows represented 15.0% of the Portfolio Value at 31 December 2013 compared to 20.4% at 31 December 2012.
The reduced exposure in the Portfolio to foreign currency is principally due to the change in Portfolio composition resulting from acquisitions during the year, together with some movements in each assets respective valuation.
The table below illustrates the impact on the Sterling value of the Portfolio as a result of a change in the Sterling Euro and Sterling Canadian Dollar exchange rates of 5%.

During 2013, JLIF hedged 100% of its Euro cash ows and used all of its Canadian Dollar income to fund the acquisition of a 50% stake in the Kelowna & Vernon Hospitals project in the latter part of 2013.
JLIF also considers natural hedging of costs and revenue items as a way of minimising the volatility of exchange rate movements on the Portfolio.
In line with JLIFs policy since launch, the Balance Sheet value of its Canadian Dollar and Euro denominated assets is not hedged.

In Continental Europe, the Kromhout Barracks project has revenues linked to Dutch CPI, and in Finland, revenues relating to the E18 road project are linked to Finnish construction and engineering indices, MAKU and ELSPOT.
As a result, and after taking account of the cost indexation arrangements of the projects, cash ows from the Portfolio as a whole are positively correlated to ination.
