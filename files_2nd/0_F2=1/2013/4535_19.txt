International growth was largely the result of: Increased trading with franchise partners A strong sales performance from the Danish business Magasin du Nord Group like-for-like sales increased by 2.0%, principally driven by growth in online sales of 46.2% to 366.3 million 2012: 250.6 million which offset the weather-impacted performance of the UK stores.

Figure 2: Components of sales growth in 2013 5 4 4.1% -2.7% 3 0.7% 2 0.4% 1 0 UK online UK stores UK space International Own bought products accounted for 76.7% of the sales mix 2012: 76.7%.
UK own bought sales mix was essentially unchanged at 79.9% 2012: 80.0% whilst International increased to 63.0% 2012: 62.6%.
Overall, own bought sales grew by 2.5% whilst concession sales were 1.9% higher than the previous year.
Operating profit Group gross margin was unchanged from the prior year.
This reflected a good recovery in the second half of the year due to a combination of better intake margin and mix which more than offset a decline of 20 basis points in the first half which was caused by increased promotional activity and the impact of bad weather in the UK.
In the UK, store costs increased by 1.6% to 585.9 million 2012: 576.7 million largely due to inflationary increases in rent, energy and payroll offset by a number of cost saving initiatives.
UK online costs grew by 34.0% to 83.5 million 2012: 62.3 million, driven entirely by higher volumes.
Importantly, online costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 270 basis points to 23.9% due to greater warehousing and distribution efficiencies arising from increased scale and bringing all own brand fulfilment in-house at the start of the second half.
Other UK costs, which comprise those not directly attributable to either stores or online and include buying and merchandising, marketing and central functions, increased by 1.5%, largely due to inflation.
International store costs increased by 4.8% and other international costs by 2.9%, supporting the revenue store increase and associated bonus payments in Magasin du Nord.
