08 Lonmin Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our Strategy Creating value from our PGM operations in South Africa SOUTH AFRICA IS THE HOME OF AROUND 80% OF THE WORLDS KNOWN RESOURCES OF PLATINUM GROUP METALS AND OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS WE HAVE INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS FUNDS TO CREATE THE CURRENT ASSET BASE.
Context Our Current Asset Base Current productive operations are in South Africa.
We also have a small resource in Canada and while we hope in time to find further economic PGM resources there and elsewhere, for the foreseeable future our principal asset base will be located in South Africa.
We have a material investment in established mines in the worlds premier PGM deposit, and have developed a long-life mineral resource over which we have long-term mineral rights granted by the South African Government.
There is significant inherent value in the existing infrastructure and the underground ore reserves that we have developed ready for mining.
Our existing operations create value through mining, focus on safety, vertical integration and harnessing our industry leading expertise in processing UG2 ore.

Our current PGM resources will enable us to sustain our business for decades to come: Marikana operations our flagship operation and currently the source of more than 95% of our annual production: Pandora operations a joint venture in which we have a 42.5% interest, contributes 5% of our annual production: Marikana Smelters and Base Metal Refinery and Brakpan Precious Metal Refinery capacity to process and refine our current and future production, offering the potential to smelt and refine third party and recycling material: Limpopo project formerly an operational mine placed on care and maintenance in early 2009.
We have a conditional agreement to sell control of this asset to our Black Economic Empowerment BEE partner, Shanduka, in pursuit of our transformation objectives: Akanani project following the recently completed pre-feasibility study, we consider this is a viable resource which offers future optionality.
We maintain our strategy of continuing exploration and studies to develop a viable operation at this location: Canadian projects joint ventures with Vale and Wallbridge exploring PGM mineralisation in the Sudbury Basin in Ontario with a pre-feasibility study on a modest open pit completed: and Northern Ireland project an early stage exploration opportunity in an area which shares a number of geological hallmarks with known economically exploited PGM deposits.
Lonmin draws significant advantage from its position on two key stock exchanges a primary listing in London and a secondary listing in Johannesburg.
They are the two exchanges on which investors are most likely to seek to invest in our business model and strategy.
It also provides the Company with excellent flexibility for liquidity in capital markets, a healthy mix of longer and shorter term investors and creates international capital inflows in to South Africa.
