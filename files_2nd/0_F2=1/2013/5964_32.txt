The reduction in salary and broadly offsetting increase in bonus for the Chief Executive resulted in the percentage applied to operating profit for his bonus increasing between 2012 and 2013.
The benefits received by the executive directors are life insurance, ill health income protection and private medical insurance.
The item in the column headed other comprises the matching shares awarded under the SIP.
The table below sets out the bonus thresholds and percentages for both directors.
Percentage Operating profit payable above Annual bonus 000 Operating profit threshold the threshold amount Chris Aspinwall 2013 36,593 20,000 2.2% 365 2012 38,371 20,000 1.8% 331 Andy Malpass 2013 36,593 20,000 0.8% 133 2012 38,371 20,000 0.8% 147 The executive directors annual bonus was a flat percentage above a threshold of the operating profit as presented to the Operating Board as disclosed in note 5 to the financial statements, excluding any items that the Committee considers to be exceptional or inappropriate.
When setting both the threshold and the flat line percentage the Committee took into account the directors on target earnings i. e. salary and bonus for the year, the projected operating profit for the year and determined that the figures chosen were sufficiently demanding taking into account the market conditions, expected financial performance and intended investments for the year.
In 2013 the long-term incentives that vested were the 2008 EGRIP award and the 2010 SBP award.
For the 2008 EGRIP award, the performance measures and targets are set out in note 19 to the financial statements with the actual performance for the 2008 EGRIP award being: the total shareholder return target was exceeded by 11%: the cumulative diluted earnings per share target was exceeded by 39%: and the overall outperformance of techMARK All-Share Index comparative index was 10%.
For the 2010 SBP award, the performance measure and targets are set out in note 19 to the financial statements with actual performance being: the total shareholder return element fully vested with the return materially greater than the target: the earnings per share element fully vested with the aggregate 4% ahead of the highest threshold: but the business development element failed to vest, which resulted in the overall vesting of the matching shares being restricted to 75%.
In 2012 the only long-term incentive that vested was the 2009 SBP award as the performance conditions for the 2007 EGRIP award were not satisfied: consequently, of the three EGRIP awards that have reached the end of their measurement period, one has lapsed and two have vested.
