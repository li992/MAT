Risk review Funding risk Liquidity Liquidity risk is the risk that a firm, although solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost.
This also results in a firms inability to meet regulatory liquidity requirements.
This risk is inherent in all banking operations and can be affected by a range of Group-specific and market-wide events.
All disclosures in this section pages 208 to 224 are unaudited and exclude BAGL unless otherwise stated Barclays has a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Management Framework the Liquidity Framework for managing the Groups liquidity risk.
The Liquidity Framework meets the PRAs standards and is designed to ensure the Group maintains liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount and quality and a funding profile that is appropriate to meet the liquidity risk appetite.
The Liquidity Framework is delivered via a combination of policy formation, review and governance, analysis, stress testing, limit setting and monitoring.
Liquidity risk is managed separately at Barclays Africa Group Limited BAGL due to local currency and funding requirements.
Unless stated otherwise, all disclosures in this section exclude BAGL and they are reported on a stand-alone basis.
Adjusting for local requirements, BAGL liquidity risk is managed on a consistent basis to Barclays Group.
For further detail on liquidity risk governance and framework see page 418.
Liquidity risk stress testing Under the Liquidity Framework, Barclays has established a Liquidity Risk Appetite LRA together with the appropriate limits for the management of the liquidity risk.
This is the level of liquidity risk the Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations.
The key expression of the liquidity risk is through internal stress testing.
This involves comparing the liquidity pool with anticipated stressed net contractual and contingent outflows for each of three stress scenarios.
Liquidity Risk Appetite The three primary liquidity stress scenarios run by the Group under its LRA and aligned to the PRAs prescribed stresses are: 90 day market-wide stress event: 30 day Barclays-specific stress event: and combined 30 day market-wide and Barclays-specific stress event.
Under normal market conditions, the liquidity pool is managed to be at least 100% of anticipated outflows under each of these stress scenarios.
The 30 day Barclays-specific stress scenario, results in the greatest net outflows of each of the liquidity stress tests.
The combined 30 day scenario assumes outflows consistent with a firm-specific stress for the first two weeks of the stress period, followed by relatively lower outflows consistent with a market-wide stress for the remainder of the stress period.

Mitigating actions Monetisation of unencumbered assets that are of known liquidity value to the firm but held outside the liquidity pool subject to haircut valuation adjustment.
Liquidity regulation Since June 2010, the Group has reported its liquidity position against Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG provided by the PRA.
The PRA defines both eligible liquidity pool assets and stress outflows against reported balances.
The Group also monitors its position against anticipated Basel 3 liquidity metrics the Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR.
The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a banks liquidity risk profile by ensuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days.
The NSFR has a time horizon of at least 12 months and has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
In January 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a final standard for the LCR.
The European CRR requires phased compliance with LCR standard from January 2015 at minimum of 60% increasing to 100% by January 2018.
In January 2014, the BCBS published a consultation proposing revision to the NSFR standards.
The minimum NSFR requirement is to be introduced in January 2018 at 100%.
The methodology for estimating the LCR and NSFR is based on an interpretation of the Basel standards and includes a number of assumptions which are subject to change prior to the implementation of CRD IV.
Based on the revised Basel standards, as at 31 December 2013, Barclays had a surplus to both of these metrics with an estimated Basel 3 LCR of 102% 2012: 126% and an estimated Basel 3 NSFR of 110% 2012: 112%.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 209 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued Comparing internal and regulatory liquidity stress tests The LRA stress scenarios, the PRA ILG and Basel 3 LCR are all broadly comparable short term stress scenarios in which the adequacy of defined liquidity resources is assessed against contractual and contingent stress outflows.

Barclays plans to maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory stress requirements at an efficient level, continuing to monitor the money markets closely, in particular for early indications of the tightening of available funding.
In these conditions, the nature and severity of the stress scenarios are reassessed and appropriate action taken with respect to the liquidity pool.
This may include further increasing the size of pool or monetising the pool to meet stress outflows.
Note a Of the three stress scenarios monitored as part of the LRA, the 30 day Barclays-specific scenario results in the lowest ratio at 104% 2012: 129%.
This compares to 127% 2012: 141% under the 90 day market-wide scenario and 112% 2012: 145% under the 30 day combined scenario.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Liquidity pool The Group liquidity pool as at 31 December 2013 was 127bn 2012: 150bn.
During 2013, the month-end liquidity pool ranged from 127bn to 157bn 2012: 150bn to 173bn, and the month-end average balance was 144bn 2012: 162bn.
The liquidity pool is held unencumbered and is not used to support payment or clearing requirements.
Such requirements are treated as part of our regular business funding.
The liquidity pool is intended to offset stress outflows and comprises cash and unencumbered assets set out below.
The decrease of the size of the liquidity pool during 2013 is consistent with Group plans to optimise the size of the liquidity pool, within our established liquidity risk appetite framework, while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.
The change in the composition of the liquidity pool, from cash and deposits with central banks to government bonds, was done to reduce the overall cost of the liquidity pool.

The maintenance of the liquidity pool increases the Groups costs as the interest expense paid on the liabilities used to fund the liquidity pool is greater than the interest income received on liquidity pool assets.
This cost can be reduced by investing a greater portion of the Group liquidity pool in highly liquid assets other than cash and deposits with central banks.
These assets primarily comprise government bonds and their inclusion in the liquidity pool does not compromise the liquidity position of the Group.
The composition of the liquidity pool is subject to limits set by the Board, Treasury Committee and the independent credit risk and market risk functions.
In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency, asset type and country.
Given the incremental returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.
As at 31 December 2013, the portion of the Group liquidity pool comprised of cash and deposits with central banks reduced to 43bn 2012: 85bn as a result of a reallocation to government bonds and other highly liquid assets.
Barclays manages the liquidity pool on a centralised basis.
As at 31 December 2013, 90% of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC 2012: 90% and was available to meet liquidity needs across the Group.
The residual liquidity pool is held predominantly within Barclays Capital Inc. BCI.
The portion of the liquidity pool outside of Barclays Bank PLC is held against entity-specific stressed outflows and regulatory requirements.
To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group.
Notes a 104bn of the liquidity pool is PRA eligible as per BIPRU 12.7.
In addition, there are 9bn of Level 2 assets available, as per PRAs announcement in August 2013 that certain assets specified by PRA as Level 2 assets can be used on a transitional basis.
b The LCR-eligible assets presented in this table represent only those assets which are also eligible for the Group liquidity pool and do not include any Level 2B assets as defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
c Of which over 95% 2012: over 95% was placed with the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 211 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued Contingent liquidity In addition to the Group liquidity pool, Barclays has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
Whilst these are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
In either a Barclays-specific or market-wide liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted.
In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at heavily discounted prices, Barclays could generate liquidity via central bank facilities.
The Group maintains a significant amount of collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available to raise funding.
For more detail on the Groups other unencumbered assets see page 216.
Funding structure The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a solid funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due.
The Groups overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base both geographically and by depositor type and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.
Within this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding.
As such, retail and commercial customer loans and advances are funded by customer deposits.
Other assets together with other loans and advances and unencumbered assets are funded by long term wholesale debt and equity.
Trading portfolio assets are largely funded by repurchase agreements.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements.
The remainder of reverse repurchase agreements are used to settle trading portfolio liabilities.
The liquidity pool is predominantly funded through wholesale markets.
These funding relationships are summarised below: a a Assets Liabilities b 360m 2012: 362m Customer loans and 366m 2012: 335m Customer deposits advances 82m 2012: 102m 1 Year wholesale funding 127m 2012: 150m Group liquidity pool 103m 2012: 138m 1 Year wholesale funding 162m 2012: 163m Other assets 102m 2012: 106m Equity and other liabilities 340m 2012: 347m Reverse repurchase 340m 2012: 347m Repurchase agreements agreements and other and other similar secured c c similar secured borrowing borrowing 323m 2012: 466m Derivative financial 319m 2012: 460m Derivative financial instruments instruments Deposit funding including BAGL audited d Deposit funding 2013 2012 Loans and Loan to Loan to advances to Customer deposit deposit Funding of loans and advances to customers customers deposits ratio ratio As at 31 December 2013 bn bn % % Retail and Business Banking 234 174 e Corporate Banking 61 109 Wealth and Investment Management 23 63 Total funding excluding secured 318 346 92 102 f Secured funding 41 Sub-total including secured funding 318 387 82 88 e Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management 318 346 92 102 Investment Bank 41 20 Head Office and Other Operations 1 Trading settlement balances and cash collateral 70 62 Total 430 428 101 110 The Group loan to deposit ratio as at 31 December 2013 was 101% 2012: 110%.

212 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management activities are funded with customer deposits.
As at 31 December 2013, the loan to deposit ratio for these businesses was 92% 2012: 102%.
The excess of the Investment Banks loans and advances over deposits is funded with long-term debt and equity.
The Investment Bank does not rely on customer deposit funding from Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management.
As at 31 December 2013, 122bn 2012: 112bn of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS and other similar schemes.
In addition to these customer deposits, there were 3bn 2012: 3bn of other liabilities insured by governments.
Although, contractually, current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice, the Groups broad base of customers numerically and by depositor type helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances.
Such accounts form a stable funding base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs.
Barclays models the behaviour of both assets and liabilities to assess balance sheet funding gaps.
The behavioural modelling approach reflects the forward-looking macroeconomic outlook and captures customer roll-over behaviour and optionality within a given asset or liability product.
These behavioural maturities are used to determine funds transfer pricing interest rates at which businesses are rewarded and charged for sources and uses of funds.

Derivative assets and liabilities are largely matched.
A substantial proportion of balance sheet derivative positions qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset once netted against cash collateral received and paid.
The liquidity pool is largely funded by wholesale debt, the majority of which matures in less than one year.
Other assets are largely matched by term wholesale debt and equity.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 213 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued Composition of wholesale funding The Group maintains access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from money markets, repo markets and term investors, across a variety of distribution channels and geographies.
The Group is an active participant in money markets, has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and long-term investors through its clients worldwide.
As a result, wholesale funding is well diversified by product, maturity, geography and major currency.
As at 31 December 2013, total wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 186bn 2012: 240bn.
82bn 2012: a 102bn of wholesale funding matures in less than one year of which 23bn 2012: 18bn relates to term funding 104bn 2012: 138bn of wholesale funding had a residual maturity of over one year.
Maturing wholesale liabilities have been replaced with customer deposits to increase the resilience and sustainability of the funding structure.
As at 31 December 2013, outstanding wholesale funding comprised 35bn 2012: 40bn of secured funding and 151bn 2012: 199bn of unsecured funding.
These notes are issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.
A large proportion of end users of these products are individual retail investors.
In 2013, Barclays repaid 3bn of funding raised through the European Central Banks 3 year LTRO, leaving 5bn 2012: 8bn outstanding as at 31 December 2013.
The liquidity risk of wholesale funding is carefully managed primarily through the LRA stress tests, against which the liquidity pool is held.
Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by 45bn 2012: 48bn.
The average maturity of wholesale funding net of the liquidity pool was at least 69 months 2012: 61 months.
Notes a Term funding maturities comprise public benchmark and privately placed senior unsecured notes, covered bonds asset-backed securities ABS and subordinated debt where the original maturity of the instrument was more than 1 year.
In addition, at 31 December 2013, 3bn of these instruments were not counted towards term financing as they had an original maturity of less than 1 year.
b The composition of wholesale funds comprises the balance sheet reported deposits from banks, financial liabilities at fair value, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities, excluding cash collateral and settlement balances.
It does not include collateral swaps, including participation in the Bank of Englands Funding for Lending Scheme.
Included within deposits from banks are 4.1bn of liabilities drawn in the European Central Banks 3 year LTRO.

Across wholesale funding, the composition is materially unchanged.
Term financing In 2013, term funding maturities were mostly offset by cash inflows arising from growth in customer deposits and run-off of Exit Quadrant assets, while a significant portion of the Groups 2013 funding needs were pre-funded in 2012.
The Group issued 1bn of net term funding in 2013, including $1bn of CRD IV compliant Tier 2 capital.
This issuance was an important transitional step towards Barclays end state CRD IV capital structure.
a The Group has 24bn of term debt maturing in 2014 and a further 22bn maturing in 2015.
The Group expects to issue more public wholesale debt in 2014 than in 2013 in order to maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and distribution channel.
Encumbrance Asset encumbrance arises from collateral pledged against secured funding and other collateralised obligations.
Barclays funds a portion of trading portfolio assets and other securities via repurchase agreements and other similar borrowing and pledges a portion of customer loans and advances as collateral in securitisation, covered bond and other similar secured structures.
Barclays monitors the mix of secured and unsecured funding sources within the Groups funding plan and seeks to efficiently utilise available collateral to raise secured funding and meet other collateralised obligations.
As at 31 December 2013, 187bn 2012: 231bn of the Groups assets were encumbered excluding reverse repurchase agreements, which primarily related to firm financing of trading portfolio assets and other securities and to funding secured against loans and advances to customers.
Encumbered assets have been identified via the Groups assets pledged process.
For securities and commodities assets are considered encumbered if there has been legal title transfer against repurchase, stock lending and other similar secured borrowing agreements, trading portfolio liabilities or derivatives margin.
Encumbered loans and advances have been identified where assets are pledged against external securitisations or covered bonds or have been used in external repurchase or other similar agreements with market counterparts or central banks.
Additionally, encumbered assets include cash collateral posted.
Encumbered assets do not include assets which may have been pledged for other reasons and do not include client activity.
In addition, 321bn 2012: 310bn of the total 390bn 2012: 360bn securities accepted as collateral, and held off-balance sheet, were on-pledged, the significant majority of which related to matched-book activity where reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder relates primarily to reverse repurchases used to settle trading portfolio liabilities as well as collateral posted against derivatives margin requirements.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 215 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued As at 31 December 2013, 332bn 2012: 300bn of assets were identified as readily available.
These consist of on and off-balance sheet assets that have not been identified as encumbered and are in transferable form.
They include cash and securities held in the Group liquidity pool as well as additional unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these additional assets are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
Loans and advances to customers are only classified as readily available if they are already in a form such that they can be used to raise funding without further management actions.
This includes excess collateral already in secured funding vehicles and collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available for use in secured financing transactions.
As at 31 December 2013, 222bn 2012: 237bn of assets were identified as available as collateral.
These assets are not subject to any restrictions on their ability to secure funding, be offered as collateral, or sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, but are not immediately available in the normal course of business in their current form.
They primarily consist of loans and advances a proportion of which would be suitable for use in secured funding structures but are conservatively classified as not readily available because they are not in transferable form.
Not available collateral consist of assets that cannot be pledged or used as security for funding due to restrictions that prevent their pledge or use as security for funding in the normal course of business.
Derivatives and reverse repo assets relate specifically to reverse repurchase agreements, derivatives and other similar secured lending.
These are shown separately as these on-balance sheet assets cannot be pledged.
However, these assets can give rise to the receipt of non-cash assets which are not recognised on the balance sheet, but can be used to raise secured funding or meet additional funding requirements.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 217 Risk review Funding risk Liquidity continued Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements Barclays enters into repurchase and other similar secured borrowing agreements to finance its trading portfolio assets.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by offsetting repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder are used to settle trading portfolio liabilities.
Due to the high quality of collateral provided against secured financing transactions, the liquidity risk associated with this activity is significantly lower than unsecured financing transactions.
Nonetheless, Barclays manages to gross and net secured mismatch limits to limit refinancing risk under a severe stress scenario and a portion of the Groups liquidity pool is held against stress outflows on these positions.
The Group secured mismatch limits are calibrated based on market capacity, liquidity characteristics of the collateral and risk appetite of the Group.
The cash value of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions will typically differ from the market value of the collateral against which these transactions are secured by an amount referred to as a haircut or .
Typical haircut levels vary depending on the quality of the collateral that underlies these transactions.
For transactions secured against highly liquid collateral, lenders demand relatively small haircuts typically ranging from 0-2%.
For transactions secured against less liquid collateral, haircuts vary by asset class typically ranging from 5-10% for corporate bonds and other less liquid collateral.
As at 31 December 2013, the significant majority of repurchase activity related to matched-book activity.
The Group may face refinancing risk on the net maturity mismatch for matched-book activity.
76% 2012: 75% of matched-book activity is against highly liquid collateral.
Where less liquid collateral is used, net repurchase refinancing requirements are managed to longer-tenors.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Credit ratings In addition to monitoring and managing key metrics related to the financial strength of Barclays, we also subscribe to independent credit rating agency reviews by Standard & Poors, Moodys, Fitch and DBRS.
These ratings assess the credit worthiness of Barclays and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial attributes including risk management processes and procedures, capital strength, earnings, funding, liquidity, accounting and governance.
A credit rating downgrade could result in contractual outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts.
Outflows related to a multiple-notch credit rating downgrade are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk.
Credit ratings downgrades could also result in increased costs or reduced capacity to raise funding.

As a result Barclays Bank PLCs rating moved to A A-1 from A A-1, and Barclays PLCs to AA-2 from A A-1.
Similarly, DBRS downgraded Barclays Bank PLC, to AA Low R-1 Mid from AA R-1 High, mainly driven by the changing regulatory environment.
The downgrades were fully reserved for in the liquidity pool and there was no significant change in deposit funding or wholesale funding.
Fitch and Moodys affirmed Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays PLC ratings.
Barclays ratings currently benefit from sovereign support assumptions made by rating agencies.
Levels of sovereign supports are reflected in the difference between the standalone rating and Barclays Bank PLCs long-term rating.
As regulation evolves, rating agencies have communicated their intention to remove all or part of this support over time.
As a consequence, Moodys put Barclays long-term and short-term ratings on a Negative outlook.
The table below shows contractual collateral requirements and contingent obligations following one and two notch long-term and associated short-term simultaneous downgrades across all credit rating agencies, which are fully reserved for in the liquidity pool.
These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements.
Further credit rating downgrades could result in contractual outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts.
These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity.
However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.

In addition to the Group liquidity pool, as at 31 December 2013, BAGL Group held 4bn 2012: 5bn of liquidity pool assets against BAGL-specific anticipated stressed outflows.
The liquidity pool consists of South African government bonds and Treasury bills.
The BAGL loan to deposit ratio as at 31 December 2013 was 103% 2012: 113%.

Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities audited The table below provides detail on the contractual maturity of all financial instruments and other assets and liabilities.
Derivatives other than those designated in a hedging relationship and trading portfolio assets and liabilities are included in the on demand column at their fair value.
Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for settlement according to such maturity and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value.
Derivatives designated in a hedging relationship are included according to their contractual maturity.
Financial assets designated at fair value in respect of linked liabilities to customers under investment contracts have been included in other assets and other liabilities as the Group is not exposed to liquidity risk arising from them: any request for funds from creditors would be met by simultaneously liquidating or transferring the related investment.
