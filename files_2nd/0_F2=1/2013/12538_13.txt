54 Premier Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW continued Occupational safety performance In 2013, we worked 11.7 million man-hours 2012: 6.1 million man-hours.
The increase on the previous year was mainly due to a number of projects moving into the construction phase 7.6 million man-hours related to construction in 2013, up from 2.0 million man-hours in 2012.
The majority of these man-hours were worked by contractors 2013: 9.8 million man-hours: 2012: 4.3 million man-hours.
There were no construction projects at Premier-operated sites during 2013.

We have presented additional detail on HSE performance for 2013 following our analysis of the issues that have emerged from increased construction activity.
Total recordable injuries The total recordable injury rate TRIR for Premier employees at Premier-operated sites was 0.0 per million man-hours for 2013.
The TRIR for Premier employees at contractor-operated sites was also 0.0 for 2013.
Both these TRIR figures well within our target performance rate of 2.0 per million man-hours reflected the strong HSE performance of Premier employees.
Significant improvements were reported in particular at our Chim So site in Vietnam, where employee and contractor injury rates decreased from 2.8 per million man-hours in 2012 to 0.8 in 2013.
Nevertheless, our overall TRIR performance deteriorated, increasing from 1.8 per million man-hours in 2012 to 3.4 in 2013.
This included a TRIR of 3.6 for contractors working at contractor-operated sites and a TRIR of 5.7 for contractors working at Premier-operated sites.
In order to improve HSE performance and build on lessons learnt, in late 2013 we instigated a more proactive approach to manage the issues at contractor facilities an approach that is continuing in 2014 and will be maintained.
High potential incidents HIPOs Insight into HIPOs and their rate of occurrence enable us to learn how to prevent or mitigate future incidents.
This involves addressing the root causes of these incidents.
We believe HIPOs are a leading indicator of potential major accidents and serious injuries.
The assessment of HIPOs complements the proactive testing of asset integrity safety systems and management under our Safety Case regime.
There was a decrease in the number of HIPOs during the reporting cycle, from 1.3 per million man-hours in 2012 to 0.7 in 2013.
This was well below our target rate of 1.5 for 2013.
Eight HIPOs in total were recorded in 2013, the same amount as in 2012.
Five of these occurred at our North Sea operations, and the other three at our Vietnam operations.
There was a significant decrease in the HIPO frequency rate in both the drilling phases 2013: 0.0, 2012: 2.5 and the production phases 2013: 1.6, 2012: 3.3.
However, there was an increase in the HIPO frequency rate at construction sites working on our projects, from 0.0 in 2012 to 0.7 in 2013.
All eight HIPOs identified in 2013 were investigated in depth.
Corrective actions were identified and their implementation monitored.
Safety alerts based on each incident were made available to all employees in order to share learning across the organisation.
Safety alerts are mandatory for all HIPOs but may also be issued where there are incidents that require heightened awareness and caution.
Process safety performance One way of recording process safety events is through the measurement of loss of primary containment LOPC.
This is a new performance measure proposed by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers OGP, and adopted by Premier.
Further work is required to harmonise process safety performance measurement across the industry, and we will continue to work with OGP.
We are a member of its Process Safety Subcommittee, and will assist in the development of an industry-wide approach to indicators and reporting.
Premier Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements 55 Loss of primary containment During 2013, there were 40 LOPC events 2012: 41 at our operations.
Of these, one was a Tier One LOPC event 2012: nil and two were Tier Two events 2012: seven.
The remaining 37 incidents were events of lesser significance, which included small gas leaks and contained oil spills that did not reach the environment.
Tier One events are those where there is a significant loss of containment from a process system i. e. gas over 500kg and oil over 1,000kg per hour.
Tier Two events are those releases of lesser consequence i. e. gas over 50kg and oil over 100kg per hour.
We measure the number of incidents or rate per activity man-hour at both our operated drilling and production operations, and use the total as a performance measure.
In 2014, we will continue to review and refine the parameters within which LOPC events are being reported.
Safety by design Premier has integrated process safety protocols into the project safety reviews PSRs of all projects.
These reviews, carried out at each project phase, provide assurance that material HSE issues have been identified and are being effectively managed throughout the project.
A typical project will require six strategic reviews as a project moves from concept to construction and then to operation.
PSRs are aligned with our project approval gates, at which time strategic decisions are made to either progress a project further towards the operations stage or to delay or divest.
Safety Cases are in place at all our operated installations.
Our Safety Case regime is consistent with United Kingdom regulatory standards.
We believe this represents best practice and implement such cases at all our operated production facilities worldwide, even when not required by the local regulatory regime.
A Safety Case is developed during the early stages of a project, becomes more detailed as a project nears the operations stage, and must be complete before production commences.
Each case includes a review and impact assessment of the relevant process safety risks against established safety benchmarks and, when necessary, further steps are required to be taken to reduce risks to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable the ALARP principle.
Our operating assets are reviewed every five years to ensure continued compliance.
Safety Cases are reviewed by either the local regulatory authority or a competent independent third party to provide assurance of compliance.
Environment PREMIER FOCUSES ON PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IN LINE WITH OUR STATED COMMITMENT TO REDUCE OUR IMPACT TO A LEVEL THAT IS AS LOW AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE.
THIS INVOLVES ONGOING ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AT ALL OUR OPERATIONS.
Environmental assessment, management and reporting are major elements of Premiers HSE risk management process.
We conduct baseline surveys and prepare environmental and social impact assessments for each new operated activity.
This involves an assessment of our potential impact on the physical, socio-economic and biological environments, including biodiversity and the rights of indigenous peoples.
We measure and review each impact in turn and gauge both its significance and how it can be reduced to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable.
Potential actions to improve environmental performance are screened based on cost, duration and impact to determine which are feasible for implementation.
