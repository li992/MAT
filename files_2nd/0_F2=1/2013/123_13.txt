The LTIP cash bonus column in the table above relates to cash bonuses paid to each of the executive directors during the year to 26 January 2013 in compensation for the waiver by them of LTIP awards made to them during 2009 which were due to vest on or around 6 October 2012.
Having met the relevant performance criteria under the LTIP rules, these directors elected, pursuant to a resolution of the Remuneration Committee and with the consent of the trustee of the LTIP, to waive those LTIP awards and receive an equivalent cash bonus in substitution for the awards.
The Remuneration Committee chose to pay these cash bonuses in recognition of the fact that, due to the potential merger with Britvic plc, the Company was in a prohibited period in terms of the Model Code on Directors Dealings in Securities.
Had the LTIP awards vested in accordance with their terms, the Remuneration Committee was of the view that the directors would have been prejudiced as a result of not being able to deal in the Companys shares which they would have received.
In order to determine the value of each cash bonus, the Remuneration Committee calculated the number of shares which would have vested pursuant to each directors LTIP award after applying the applicable performance conditions and multiplying such number by the average closing price of the shares for the 60 dealing days prior to 5 September 2012 being the date when it was announced that the Company was in preliminary merger discussions with Britvic plc.
White constituted a smaller related party transaction under the Listing Rules and was subject to the requirements of Listing Rule 11.1.
The aggregate value of gains realised on the exercise of share options in the year to 26 January 2013 under the SAYE scheme was 10,313.
The aggregate value of gains realised on share awards in the year to 28 January 2012 under the LTIP was 1,217,790.
This gain for the year to 28 January 2012 is shown in the table above in order to provide a comparable figure for total emoluments and LTIP awards for the year to 26 January 2013, due to the fact that, as noted above, cash bonuses were made to directors in lieu of LTIP awards during the year to 26 January 2013.
Benefits in kind include the provision of a company car and fuel.
No director waived emoluments in respect of the years ended 26 January 2013 or 28 January 2012.

The lowest and highest prices during the year were 348p and 550p respectively.
Directors pensions During the year to 26 January 2013, all executive directors were members of the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme on a contributory basis.
Their dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Where the Scheme provides a pension on a defined benefit basis, final pensionable salary is used to determine the directors pension entitlement.
Where benefits are provided on a defined contribution basis, the benefits depend on the directors accumulated fund.
Lump sum life assurance cover is provided at four times Pensionable Salary.
The pension entitlements earned by the directors during the year under the defined benefit section of the Scheme calculated in accordance with the requirements of the U. K. Listing Authority listing rules and the Companies Act 2006, were as follows: Transfer value Increase in Total accrued of net increase Value of accrued Value of accrued Total change in accrued pension pension in year, net pension pension value during year, during the year entitlement at of member entitlement at entitlement at net of member net of inflation 26 January 2013 contributions 28 January 2012 26 January 2013 contributions 000 000 per annum 000 000 000 000 R.

White 65 n a 1,021 1,058 37 A. L. Memmott 1 41 11 812 797 15 During the year to 26 January 2013, W. R. G. Barr was in receipt of a pension from the Scheme.
However, as there were no increases applied to his benefit other than those that apply to other members of the Scheme, there is nothing to be disclosed in respect of him.
A. L. Memmott ceased his accrual under the defined benefit plan on 1 March 2008.
His accrued benefits retain a link to his final pensionable salary.
White ceased his accrual under the defined benefit plan on 5 April 2011.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he retired at the year end.
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008.
The figures showing the transfer value of net increase over the period include an allowance for the costs of providing death in service benefits.
The change in the amount of the transfer value during the year is made up of the following elements: a transfer value of the increase in accrued pension: b change in the transfer value of accrued pension at the start of the year due to ageing: and c the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis.
Directors pay contributions as required by the Scheme and these amounts are offset in calculating the values shown in columns headed Transfer value of net increase in year and Total change in value during year.
The transfer value of the accrued entitlements represents the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liabilities in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, accordingly, have been excluded from the remuneration table.
