2013 Investment Manager Report BLUEMATRIX Strong performance in 2013 was driven by gains made across all of BlueMatrixs regional portfolios and signal families.
For the majority of the year, stable conditions in equity markets led to greater single stock return dispersion, accompanied by healthy trading volumes which provided a favourable environment for the strategy.
The European portfolio made the greatest contribution to returns, with a significant contribution also made by the North American portfolio and more modest contributions from the Emerging Markets and Asian portfolios.
All signal families: Traditional, Alternative and Proprietary, were positive performers.
The Traditional signals outperformed, as signals including Analyst Estimates made a significant contribution.
The Alternative and Proprietary signals also contributed significantly to performance with consistent returns that diversified the returns of the Traditional signals.
In 2014, the portfolio is expected to continue to benefit from the increased diversification across additional countries and signals, due to the enhancements made to the model during 2013.
