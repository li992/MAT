Key performance indicators At Group level, we measure the performance of the business using a number of key performance indicators KPIs.
These help to ensure that we are delivering against our stated objectives.
Certain KPIs are more appropriately measured for each of our two operating businesses, whereas other KPIs are best measured for the Group as a whole.

It is measured before exceptional costs, amortisation of intangibles and fair value remeasurements.

If utilisation falls below 60%, yield will tend to suffer, whilst above 70% we may not have enough fleet in certain stores to meet our customers needs.
US utilisation reached record levels during 2012 13, while in the UK utilisation recovered from the low of 2011 12.
