This arises from the consolidation offset between various asset classes diversication.
The UK Commodities desk was closed and all residual positions were unwound.
UK and Other The average VaR utilisation was lower than that in 2012, mainly as a result of a reduction in risk on the Structured Equity Derivatives desk.
Using hypothetical clean profit and loss data for backtesting resulted in five exceptions over the year i. e. where the loss was greater than the 99% one-day VaR.
This is more than expected at the 99% level and was largely due to a worsening in the correlation offset between desks compared to that implied from the historical data used in our VaR scenarios.
As can be seen from the graph below some of these exceptions were marginal and as such have not raised any concerns with our VaR model.
Using hypothetical clean profit and loss data for backtesting resulted in three exceptions, which is in line with the number of exceptions that a 99% VaR implies.
The exceptions were due to normal trading losses.
Using actual profit and loss resulted in one exception which is lower than expected.
There have been two exceptions i. e. where the daily loss is greater than the VaR.
This is in line with the expected number of exceptions at the 99% level.
The exceptions were a result of daily losses in interest rate positions due to high levels of market volatility.
The spike in the 99% one-day VaR was due to a basis risk associated with a position which was unwound on the 5th April 2013, at which point 99% one-day VaR fell from A$307 000 to A$55 000.
