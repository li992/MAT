FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW Quarterly benchmark prices for seaborne metallurgical coal dropped sharply in the latter half of the year, reaching a Metallurgical Coal recorded an underlying operating four-year low of $145 tonne in the third quarter.
The average profit of $46 million, 89% lower than the 2012 figure of 2013 HCC quarterly price fell by 24% to $159 tonne from $405million.
This was attributable to a 24% decrease in the 2012 average of $210 tonne.

Output rose by 39% following best practice ADAPTIVE WATER longwall performance, driven in turn by a 45% year on year MANAGEMENT improvement in cutting hours, an increase in automated cutting, and a reduction in unplanned downtime.
Performance improved by 16% year on year at Capcoals underground operation, through increased reliability of the longwall, with a 15% improvement in cutting hours and improved coal clearance system uptime.
Record coal production was achieved at Foxleigh open cut mine, with a 4% increase over the prior year, on the back of productivity improvements arising from increased equipment availability and optimal alignment of equipment to pit conditions.
In Canada, Peace River Coal increased coal production by 22%, reflecting improvements in mining design, greater productivity in mining operations as well as yield and throughput enhancements in the coal preparation plant.

Outlook An oversupply of metallurgical coal has been generated by strong metallurgical production from Australia and high Pillars of value: US exports, with metallurgical coal prices expected to remain subdued into 2014.
For more on Pillars of value and our KPIs See pages 1415 and 1819 US exports are starting to reduce in response to lower prices: however, record Australian production has more than offset any reductions.
Capacity increases from Australian greenfield supply in the second half of 2014 will continue to limit any significant price improvement.
Seaborne metallurgical coal demand is expected to increase to around 305 Mt in 2014, approximately 8% higher than 2013.
Metallurgical Coal is positioned to take advantage of any future coal price increases as a result of its focus on delivering high margin, low cost capacity, and the demonstrated benefits of business improvement initiatives.
