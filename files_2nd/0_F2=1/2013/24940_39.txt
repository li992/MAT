The vesting of these awards is subject to a service condition and satisfactory completion of the DPA.
The DPA condition ends on the fifth anniversary of the award date unless the DPA is extended or otherwise continues beyond that date, in which case the awards will vest on the date on which the DPA expires and otherwise ceases to operate.
31 In its meeting of 15 January 2014, the Group Remuneration Committee used its discretion to reduce overall variable pay by 1.25m equivalent to 18.5% of the total annual incentive and GPSP.
This adjustment was considered appropriate in the context of overall Group-wide year-over-year profitability and incentive pool funding, Group-wide risk and compliance, market remuneration benchmarks and the remuneration recommendations for the Group CEOs direct reports.
32 Maximum award potentials for fixed pay allowances and variable pay awards are based on obtaining shareholder approval to increase the maximum variable pay award as a percentage of fixed pay under CRD IV from 100% to 200% at the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2014.
If shareholder approval is not obtained the maximum fixed pay allowance payable for each executive Director under the policy will be the difference between i 50% of maximum total remuneration of the executive Director under this policy as shown in the Remuneration scenarios chart on page 389 and ii the aggregate of the base salary and cash allowance in lieu of pension for that executive Director.
Maximum variable pay award levels will be revised to 100% of fixed pay and the maximum annual incentive and GPSP awards will accordingly be reduced to 1 3 and 2 3 of this amount i. e. 33% and 67% of fixed pay, respectively.
The requested increase in the cap to 200% would enable us to minimise the increase in fixed remuneration costs and so help to maintain greater flexibility on total pay.
