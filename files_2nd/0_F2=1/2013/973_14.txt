After increasing moderately to 804 c lb, LME nickel prices Barro Alto produced 25,100 tonnes of nickel in 2013, fell to a low of 622 c lb in July as a result of economic 16% higher than 2012.
This increase reflects improved concerns.
These price declines led to a reduction in demand operational stability in the second half of the year, following owing to the way in which stainless steel producers pass the planned Line 2 sidewall rebuild and subsequent metal on raw material costs to their buyers with a one month lag.
Further pressure came from the impact of increasing new nickel supply, most notably NPI in China.
Despite this improvement, equipment sensitivities remain.

readings at the dam at Barro Alto mine.
Outlook Production in 2014 is expected to be similar to 2013, as close monitoring of Barro Alto facilitates greater operational stability in advance of the furnace rebuilds.
The first rebuild is expected to commence in late 2014, and the second in late 2015, with the rebuilds and associated ramp-ups fully completed during 2016.
We currently expect production at Barro Alto and Codemin to be between 20,000 and 25,000 tonnes in 2015, and between 35,000 and 38,000 tonnes in 2016, although this forecast may be revised as the Barro Alto rebuild timetable is finalised.
Short term prices are expected to remain under pressure owing to the prevailing macro-economic environment and ramp up of new nickel supply.
If the change in Indonesian government policy announced in early 2014 to ban nickel ore exports is sustained, this will tighten the nickel market and support strengthening prices.
In any event, medium to longer term nickel prices are expected to improve owing to forecast demand growth outstripping that of supply.
