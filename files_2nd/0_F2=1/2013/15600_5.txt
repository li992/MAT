They rely on us to do these things consistently well and we strive to do them better, more simply and more efficiently each time.
We have convenient, well-invested store and distribution networks, with a skilled and experienced team and modern systems designed to help us do this reliably as well as growing capability and scale online.
This operational effectiveness is at the core of the Tesco business model.
Winning loyalty is also about looking constantly at ways to do things differently and innovating for customers so that our offer doesnt stand still.
Innovation comes from insight and insight starts with listening.
We try to work out what matters to customers by talking to them and the conversation goes on all the time, in all our businesses, in stores and online, whether it is through our regular customer question time sessions or social media feedback.
Customers tell us whats important to them when were doing well and, even more importantly, when were not.
Coupling that feedback with the data we get from Clubcard and the analysis we apply from dunnhumby and then acting on the result is what Tesco is all about.
The virtuous circle Striving for continuous improvement in operations and in the shopping trip, as well as staying close to customers, are fundamentals but the engine of the Tesco business model has always been a combination of scale and growth.
This remains just as true today in an environment where growth across many markets is harder to come by.
Tesco may only be as successful as a customers last shopping trip but our scale and how we use it are very important to how we create value.
Buying well and selling efficiently are essential in order to be competitive for customers.
When we combine these really well, we deliver a great offer and customers reward us with more of their business.
The more we sell, the more we are able to work with our suppliers to achieve mutually beneficial economies of scale, which in turn creates room to invest more for customers in products, categories and businesses.
This has served the business well over many decades but in our business in the UK we stepped off the virtuous circle when the recession hit.
We didnt put enough back in for customers at a time when they were under pressure and our performance and reputation felt the effect.
We recognised the need to change, and last year we chose to reduce and reset our own margin to fund substantial investment in improving the shopping trip for customers and to move the business towards stronger growth.
The key enablers The core elements of the business model have six key enablers including, for example, leveraging Group skill and scale and innovating our offer which maximise the potential of the core activities and ensure that what we do is sustainable.
Transferring know-how, new systems and processes around the Group has become a regular part of how we do things based on the principle of invent once, deploy everywhere.
As our leadership group which numbers over 500 directors gains even more experience in multiple markets, new technologies and approaches can be introduced quickly and cost-effectively.
Loyalty and own-label programmes, format expertise and online trading platforms are all current examples of Tesco leveraging Group skill and scale.
As keeping pace with changing consumer shopping patterns what they buy, how, where and when they shop becomes ever more demanding, staying close to our customers means that we are well-placed to see and to grasp the opportunities to innovate.
For example, we spend a lot of time applying new technology in-store so that we can improve the shopping experience for customers.
A good example is Scan as you Shop now in 100 stores which allows customers to scan products as they put them into the trolley, see how much they are spending as they go, and reduce their waiting time at the checkouts.
