Directors Report Under our corporate renewal plan, we have committed to review the Groups variable incentivisation structures for the leadership such that they support the process of behavioural change and ensure there is a commitment to do what is right and to deal with our customers fairly and transparently beyond merely the achievement of financial measures.
Changes to our leadership bonus plan have already been agreed for 2014 to reflect this objective.
For 2014, performance measures in respect of the bonus for Executive Directors will be based 50% on financial metrics and 50% on non-financial metrics related to implementing our corporate renewal plan, stabilising our business and providing clarity of leadership and direction.
For the 2014 policy, we have decided to make the following changes to improve the alignment of our remuneration with long-term shareholder interests and sustained performance: We have introduced a two-year holding period post-vesting for shares under the PSP, and We have introduced malus provisions pre-vesting for the PSP and DBP, and claw back during the holding period for PSP awards.
We will keep our remuneration under review to ensure it remains strongly linked to the strategy and we will, therefore, during 2014 conduct a fuller review of incentives and of our remuneration policy.
It is, therefore, possible that changes will be made for 2015, and a further binding policy vote in 2015 may be required.
Shareholder engagement The Committee will engage as appropriate with our shareholders and key shareholder bodies during any policy review undertaken during 2014.
In the short term we will also be consulting on the appropriate targets to apply to our long-term incentives for 2014 awards ahead of the Annual General Meeting.
I, and the Committee believe it is important to continue to maintain effective channels of communication with our shareholders.
The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and these views have been influential in shaping our policy and practice.
The voting outcome at the 15 May 2013 General Meeting in respect of the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2012 is set out on page 102 and reflected very strong shareholder support for the Companys remuneration policy.
We welcome shareholder feedback on any aspects of executive remuneration.
In summary, it has been an extraordinarily difficult time for Serco over the last 8 months.
I believe that in making the necessary decisions the Remuneration Committee has rigorously sought to ensure that reward is clearly linked to performance and shareholder interests: that no payment is made for failure or loss of office: and that the reward for Rupert Soames as our new Group Chief Executive is positioned appropriately to attract someone of his leadership capability and commercial track-record, both of which are critical for Sercos future success.
