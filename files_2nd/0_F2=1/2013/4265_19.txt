CSR in review Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Research and Development R&D expenses We analyse R&D expenses between underlying and other R&D expenses.
The table below sets forth the main components of the total R&D expense, and highlights the differences between these two measures.
2013 2012 2013 vs 2012 Amount % of Amount % of Increase $ million Revenue $ million Revenue $ million % change Research and Development underlying R&D expenses 248.4 25.9 272.3 26.6 23.9 9 Share-based payment charges 22.9 2.4 15.0 1.5 7.9 53 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 1.8 0.2 3.1 0.3 1.3 42 Total 273.1 28.4 290.4 28.3 17.3 6 underlying R&D costs were 9% lower at $248.4 million for 2013, mainly due to the inclusion of $6.2 million of uK R&D tax credits, and a reduction in R&D headcount following the transfer of 288 engineers as part of the Samsung Transaction in October 2012.
Primarily because of this transaction, we saw the average R&D headcount fall from 1,654 in 2012, to 1,458 in 2013.
Share based payment charges increased by $7.9 million between 2013 and 2012 due to the increase in our share price, which increased both the fair value of share options and awards issued in 2013 and the accrued cost of cash settled shares and associated taxes.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles fell in 2013 because assets recognised as part of our 2009 acquisition of the SiRF group became fully amortised in the year.
Sales, General and Administration SG&A expenses SG&A expenses were $193.7 million in 2013, a decrease of 19% from 2012 $238.0 million.
We analyse SG&A expenses between underlying SG&A and other costs, which are shown below: 2013 2012 2013 vs 2012 Increase Amount % of Amount % of decrease $ million Revenue $ million Revenue $ million % change Sales, general and administrative underlying SG&A expenses 150.7 15.7 174.1 17.0 23.4 13 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 6.8 0.7 8.3 0.8 1.5 18 Share-based payment charges 15.4 1.6 12.8 1.2 2.6 20 Integration and restructuring costs 24.7 2.6 27.5 2.7 2.8 10 Patent and litigation settlement 4.7 0.5 15.5 1.5 10.8 70 Release of litigation provision 9.8 1.0 9.8 Fair value of contractual milestones 5.0 0.5 5.0 Other operating income 3.8 0.4 0.2 3.6 Total 193.7 20.2 238.0 23.2 44.3 19 Underlying SG&A costs were lower primarily due to a reduction in average headcount from 820 in 2012, to 659 in 2013: this reduction was mostly due to the full year impact of restructuring activities in 2012 and 2013.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles fell in 2013 because assets recognised as part of our 2009 acquisition of the SiRF group became fully amortised during the year.
Share-based payment charges increased by $2.6 million in 2013 due to the increase in our share price, which increased both the fair value of share options and awards issued in the year and the accrued cost of cash settled shares and associated taxes.
Integration and restructuring costs in 2013, predominantly relate to restructuring that completed during the year and related to the Samsung Transaction in 2012, rationalisation of the Groups legal entities and offices following the 2011 Zoran acquisition, and $6.5 million of costs due to our decision to cease investment in future camera products.
Integration and restructuring costs during 2012 were significantly higher than 2013 and consisted of the final restructuring and integration programme costs following the 2011 Zoran acquisition, and costs arising following the Samsung Transaction.
Litigation settlement costs of $4.7 million in 2013 were $10.9 million lower than in 2012 $15.5 million.
In 2013 we also released a provision of $9.8 million relating to other historical litigation.
See page 122 for further information.
As part of the Samsung Transaction we supported Samsung in certain R&D activities, from which we earned $3.8 million of other operating income during 2013.
Costs associated with this support are reported within restructuring and integration costs.
We currently expect the level of this support, and the income and costs arising from these activities, to decline during 2014.
Under the terms of the Samsung Transaction, provision was made for possible adjustment of up to $5 million in consideration depending on the timing of certain deliverables that CSR and Samsung agreed to deliver together.
As at 27 December 2013 we estimated the fair value as a $5 million liability based on the current timetable of deliverables.
