Charlie Baker-Collingwood London, United Kingdom When Charlie Baker-Collingwoods father passed away, Charlie started thinking about putting money into a pension because, as a self employed business owner, nobody else was going to do it for him.
Charlie runs a tailoring business on Londons Savile Row which delivers suits using branded Vespa scooters.
Seeing my father, when he was not well, having his pension was very inspiring for me: it was the impetus for me in organising my own pension says Charlie.
Now its hopefully something I can just sit back and relax a little bit about.
When I need it, my pension will be there to provide for me and my family.
