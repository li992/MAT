During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of PwC for Group audit and local, statutory audit work.
The evaluation took the form of a survey comprising a range of questions covering objectivity, quality and efficiency and was completed by individual Rio Tinto business units.
In addition, in the current year a further review was completed in October 2013 of the overall relationship with the auditors.
The results of this survey and review were presented to the Audit Committee which concluded that PwC continued to provide a high-quality audit and an effective and independent challenge to management.
The Audit Committee was satisfied with the external audit process and the independence of the external auditors.
PwC have been the external auditors since before the formation of the dual listed companies structure in 1995.
For the reasons noted on page 62 the Audit Committee does not consider it necessary at the present time to undertake a tender process for the Groups external audit.
Since 2002, PwC have followed the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and APB Ethical Standards and rotated both the lead UK and Australian audit partners at least every five years.
In the UK, the audit engagement partner was appointed in 2011, and in Australia the audit engagement partner was appointed in 2012.
They are due to transition after 2015 and 2016 respectively.
This continued refreshing of the 46 riotinto.
