In February 2014, we started trial processing of the first batches of Mayskoye concentrate, and the cost recovery achieved will be one of the key factors in determining the split between in-house processing and off-take for Mayskoye.

This was also a result of a robust operating performance in terms both of mining and processing, as well as a healthy cost performance, which will be performance at the open-pit mine and processing plant at Albazino where a considerable increase in throughput underpinned by operation of the POX plant at design parameters.

Mining tHRouGHout 2103 The open-pit mine at Albazino continues to run in accordance Our focus within Albazino will be increasingly on the geotechnical and feasibility study for new resources and with the mine plan and with a stable grade profile.
The amounts of ore mined increased 10% year-on-year to 1,338 Kt, and their conversion to reserves, with the major reserve update expected by the end of 2014.
By that time, we expect a further increase in mine capacity is expected in 2014 to match the increased concentrator throughput.

Processing Ore processed grew by 23% year-on-year and comprised 1,513 Kt while average gold grade processed increased by 6% to 5.6 g t. As a result, gold in concentrate produced at Albazino in 2013 increased by 32% year-on-year.
This was driven mainly by the considerable increase in plant throughput, where an annual run-rate of 1.6 Mtpa has been achieved since mining: 2013 2012 statistics the implementation of a number of optimisation and fide- % bottlenecking measures.
