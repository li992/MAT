02 Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Financial highlights 2013 SALES In financial terms, Pearsons goal is to achieve sustainable growth on three key financial goals earnings, cash and return on invested capital, 5.2bn and reliable cash returns to our investors through healthy and growing dividends.
In 2013 trading was tough in many of our biggest and most established markets.
At the same time we are now in a more intensive phase of 2% investment, investing much more, both in building the technology and related infrastructure, and in the next generation of products and services.
We also continue to finance the one-off costs of the biggest restructuring in Pearsons recent history.
Headline earnings and cash were again lower than the previous year and our return on invested capital fell to 5.4% from 9.1% in 2013.
We are proposing a 7%dividend increase.
