Glencore Xstrata Annual Report 2013 32 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Additional information Pro forma financial results Basis of presentation The unaudited pro forma financial information detailed below and where otherwise noted has been prepared as if the acquisition of Xstrata plc and full consolidation of such had taken place as of 1 January 2012 to illustrate the effects of the acquisition on the profit from continuing operations and cash flow statement for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
The pro forma financial information is presented before significant items unless otherwise stated to provide an enhanced understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
The pro forma financial information has been prepared in a manner consistent with the accounting policies applicable for periods ending on or after 1 January 2013 as outlined in note 1 of the financial statements with the exception of the accounting treatment applied to certain associates and joint ventures for which Glencores attributable share of revenues and expenses are presented see note 2 and reflects the provisional fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of Xstrata on 2 May 2013 as if the acquisition had occurred and those fair value adjustments had arisen at 1 January 2012.
These adjustments primarily relate to depreciation, amortisation and the unwind of onerous and unfavourable contract provisions.
The pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, addresses a hypothetical situation and therefore does not reflect the Groups actual financial position or results.
A reconciliation of the pro forma results to the reported results for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 is included in the Appendix on page201.
Pro forma results On a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA in 2013 of $13,071 million was in-line with 2012, as improved marketing results, increased production and productivity gains at many of our industrial operations and some acquisition-related synergies, helped to offset the impact of weaker average commodity prices on our industrial activities.
Adjusted EBIT decreased by 13% in 2013, due to the additional depreciation expense, consistent with increasing production.
Pro forma Industrial Adjusted EBITDA declined by 4% to $10,472 million in 2013 EBIT down 21% to $5,078 million, owing primarily to weaker average year over year commodity prices, including coal API4, nickel, silver, gold and copper down 13%, 14%, 23%, 15% and 8% respectively.
Increased production across many of our assets, notably African copper up 43%, Collahuasi up 58%, Antapaccay up 192%, Ernest Henry up 107% and Prodeco up 26%, together with weaker producer currencies notably AUD and ZAR and integration other cost savings initiatives, largely offset the impact of commodity price declines and the impact of reduced production resulting from the planned closures of the Perseverance and Brunswick mines.

Glencore Xstrata Annual Report 2013 33 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Additional information Financial review Pro forma Marketing Adjusted EBITDA increased by 17% to $2,599 million in 2013, while EBIT was up 11% to $2,356 million, representing 32% of pro forma Adjusted EBIT, up from 25% in 2012.
2013 saw an improved performance from metals and minerals, with healthy contributions from each of the metals marketing groups aided by good overall volume growth and relatively tight physical demand conditions in many markets e. g. zinc and aluminium.
Energy EBIT was up 45% over 2012, with coal in particular recovering from a 2012 base, which offered limited arbitrage opportunities.
The Agricultural products segment, as reported in our interim results, was substantially lower, compounded by crop shortfalls, limited volatility and South American logistics and sourcing challenges experienced during H1 2013.
H2 2013 saw a substantial improvement on H1 2013, with the halves contributing $260 million and $123 million respectively to the overall 2013 Marketing EBITDA, including the benefit of a solid Viterra performance.
These results reinforce the strength and resilience of Glencores business model and the diversification benefits associated with combining and integrating, across a broad spectrum of commodities, a portfolio of industrial assets with large scale physical sourcing, marketing and logistics capabilities.
Reported financial results Basis of presentation The reported financial information has been prepared on the basis as outlined in note 1 of the financial statements.
It is presented in the Financial Review section before significant items unless otherwise stated to provide an enhanced understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
Significant items refer to page 35 are items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact and nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results.
The reported results comprise those of the legacy Glencore operations for 2013 including the Groups equity accounted 34% interest in Xstrata up to the date of acquisition plus 100% of the results of Xstrata plc from the date of acquisition, 2 May 2013.
A summary of reported results and brief related commentary is provided below.
Marketing Adjusted EBITDA and EBIT were $2,599 million and $2,356 million, up 17% and 11% respectively over 2012, owing to stronger performances from the metals and energy marketing groups, offset by a lower contribution from the agricultural marketing group.

Similar Chinese demand growth rates are anticipated in 2014, driven by additional grid infrastructure and residential construction spending as well as the commissioning of an estimated two million tonnes of new rod capacity.
Furthermore, our expectations of strong global cathode demand in 2014 is expected to be supported by improving economic conditions in the developed world, driven primarily by the US and ex-China Asia, but also supported by Europe, which is expected to post demand growth for the first time since 2010, as the global economy recovers from one of the largest recessions in many years.

Ore prices remained range bound as South African producers increased capacity, while Chinese demand remained healthy.
Vanadium prices were firm in H1 2013 with the expectation of increased demand within China.
However, this was met, to a large extent, by increased domestic Chinese vanadium output, such oversupply then flowing back to the broader market, putting pressure on prices later in the year.

Adjusted EBITDA was $7,203 million, up 2% from $7,052 million, driven by strong production growth, particularly copper up 26%, gold up 14% and ferrochrome up 32%, relating to the Groups key growth projects including Mutanda, Katangaand Antapaccay and improved production from Collahuasi, offset by lower average metal prices e. g. S&P GSCI Industrial Metals Index down 7%.
Adjusted EBIT was $4,036 million, down 11% from $4,534 million compared to 2012, reflecting the higher depreciation and amortisation charge, consistent with the increased production.

The increase mainly relates to increase over 2012.
The increase reflects the continuation the growth projects at Prodeco and Australia thermal of the expansion project which is expected to increase coal specifically at Ravensworth North, Rolleston and production to c. 21 million tonnes per annum, in line with Ulan operations.
Production in 2013 was affected by the capacity specified in the Puerto Nuevo port concession.
a number of decisions to cut back production at lower return operations areas in response to the low coal Puerto Nuevo $550 million project, which completed on price environment.
time and in budget commenced loading on 13 April 2013 and is operating at required capacity.
Australian coking Australia coking coal was 7.3 million tonnes in 2013, a 6% Cerrejn increase over 2012.
The increase over 2012 relates mainly Cerrejn produced 11.0 million tonnes of coal Glencores to productivity improvements at Oaky Creek and the attributable share, 5% below 2012, predominantly due to resolution of some operational issues that impacted 2012. the impact of the 32 day strike in Q1 2013.
Production growth was impacted by decisions to counter the low coal price environment, including moving from Oil dual longwall to a single longwall operation at Oaky North Oil E&P produced 22.5 million barrels of gross oil and Collinsville being placed on care and maintenance, production during 2013, broadly in line with 2012.
The 2013 following an inability to agree an appropriate enterprise production includes the first year of production from Alen, agreement with the union.
Equatorial Guinea from June 2013 and Badila, Chad from September 2013, offset by an expected reduction at Aseng, Australian thermal and semi-soft Equatorial Guinea, as the field came off plateau.
Q4 2013 Australia thermal production including semi-soft coking was the strongest quarter of the year by some margin.
was 57.7 million tonnes in 2013, an increase of 9% over 2012.
The growth relates mainly to the successful ramp-ups attributable to the Ravensworth North, Rolleston and Ulan expansion projects.
South African thermal South Africa thermal coal production was 43.5 million tonnes in 2013, a reduction of 5% compared to 2012.
This relates mainly to proactively reducing production, including a decision not to produce bypass coal at Tweefontein, resulting in reduced yields but higher quality coal and a decision not to reclaim dump material at Impunzi.
Adverse ground conditions, heavy rain, industrial action and some equipment delays also impacted production, particularly in Q4 2013.

Within this environment, oilseed prices remained firm in H2 2013 buoyed by strong Chinese demand for soyabeans and a tight supply demand picture, particularly in the US.
By contrast grain prices declined in response to record North American and large EU crops.
The prospect of a bumper Brazilian soyabean new crop may alleviate some of the oilseed tightness.
Our grain and oilseed volumes increased significantly, primarily as a result of the Viterra acquisition.
A record Canadian crop was positive for grain procurement and handling results, however a lack of railroad capacity constrained volume growth.
The Australian grain handling business performed satisfactorily, against a backdrop of a good, but not as large as expected, South Australian crop.
All planned Viterra disposals completed during H2 2013, including the malt and pasta businesses.
The building of a joint venture export elevator in Newcastle, Australia continues as planned with completion expected in March 2014.
In addition, the first stage of a new oilseed export facility at Itaqui, Brazil is expected to be complete by July 2014.

The increase in volumes mainly relates to the key expansion projects at Rio Vermelho and Timbues.
Rio Vermelho crushed 2.3 million tonnes of sugarcane in 2013, an increase of 79% over 2012, driven by the multi-year investment in processing capacity and sugarcane planting, while Timbues, a new large-scale soyabean crushing plant in Argentina in which Glencore is a large minority investor ramped up volumes during H2 2013, following receipt of export approvals in July 2013.
