INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT A year in which the net asset value per share appreciates 26.9% is a good year for Herald shareholders.
Greater interest in smaller companies means that at last there is two way trade in underlying investee companies.
In consequence, although the discount has narrowed in nominal terms, the discount to realisable value has probably widened.
However it has not been an altogether easy year.
First, the performance of underlying investee companies has disappointed more than pleased on the upside to a greater degree than any year since 2002, with the brief exception of the temporary disruption after the demise of Lehman Brothers.
If the return on the fund was 26.9%, and the p e on the profitable stocks in the portfolio appreciated by 26.1%, it implies almost zero profits growth.
The reality was in fact somewhat better than this because takeovers were generally of profitable portfolio companies, and much of the cash generated was reinvested in earlier stage loss making companies.
For several years the proportion of the portfolio in loss making companies has been around 17.5%, but this rose to 22.5% in 2012 and to 28.3% at the end of 2013.
Furthermore the market has aggressively rerated dividend paying companies.
We have chosen to take profits in some of these holdings in favour of earlier stage loss making companies, for which the market has less appetite and which seem to offer more potential upside.
With portfolio changes it is hard to quantify at what rate profits have actually grown, but it feels like high single digits rather than the low double digit rate of growth to which we have been accustomed.
The year has been more challenging in terms of profits growth for a number of reasons.
Particularly in the first half economic growth was non-existent in Europe and below expectations in emerging markets.
The PC market, which is central to the sector, declined in volume terms by 5% to 300m source:IDC.
The smartphone market has become commoditised.
The defence market has declined as governments attempt to rein back fiscal deficits.
The reaction to the financial crisis was tightly to control costs, including salary rises.
Now the labour market for skills, particularly in the STEM Science, technology, engineering and maths space relevant to this portfolio is very tight and wage inflation has returned.
In a low growth environment companies have to invest for growth and in a knowledge based world this means investing through the profit and loss account with development expense and branding, less in terms of capital expenditure.
Offsetting these negatives technology continues to open up new markets.
Secondly, we had borrowings in place which were not fully utilised in equity investments.
In hindsight this was a lost opportunity, but the markets seem to have climbed a wall of fear.
The scale of quantitative easing is a huge macroeconomic experiment which I am not wise enough to understand.
It seems that at any time interest rates will normalise, with implications for asset prices.
We were also influenced by the fact that there were more downgrades in terms of profit expectations than upgrades.
We have chosen to keep some ammunition at hand in expectation of a market wobble which has yet to materialise.
Our recent policy has been to be invested no more than 100%.

indd 7 05 03 2014 09:01 INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT continued Thirdly, the dominant UK and US portfolios have performed well in absolute terms, so the asset allocation has been good, but the portfolios have underperformed the most relevant indices a little, which upsets my competitive streak.
I shall address the specifics in the geographic portfolio review, but more generally I reiterate that the mandate for this fund is generally to invest in quoted smaller companies in the TMT technology, media and telecommunications sectors.
With a global mandate it is anomalous that the weighting is so high in the UK.
The reason is that there have been two severe crashes this century, in 2002-3 and 2008-9, which both led to exceptional buying opportunities in the UK.
In addition the flight of pension funds and insurance companies from UK equities has led to a prolonged period where UK valuations have been relatively attractive.
The strong UK and US returns this year have again vindicated this asset allocation choice.
Finally, there has been the burden of the introduction of the AIFMD and the change of administrator and company secretary.
It is to be hoped in these respects that the worst is behind us.
Sector Background The rather negative assessment of the headwinds is offset by a continued enthusiasm for the sector and relief that the asset class at last seems to be returning to favour.
The use of the internet becomes ever more pervasive.
If the smartphone tablet boom is maturing, innovation is occurring in the internet of things, which is a current buzzword.
Energy conservation continues to be a driver for innovation in semiconductors.
In software the drivers are regulation in financial services, and marketing analytics as businesses come to terms with the internet.
Big data is the buzzword here, which encompasses storage and transportation as well as analytics.
The automotive industry is huge economically, but less relevant in terms of shareholder perception because profitability is low.
However, there is now around 2km of cabling in a car, and 100m lines of software code, and innovation is occurring continuously in terms of energy efficiency, safety, infotainment, communication and comfort.
For all these big trends there is a complex supply chain, and consequential derivative markets which smaller companies can exploit.
The internet has mushroomed because it is an unregulated open standard.
How do you control an unregulated environment?
Initially security was about irritating viruses.
Increasingly it is about professional theft of both money and ideas.
Spying is no longer a world of John le Carre, but by computer.
Meanwhile populations have the ability to communicate through mobile phones in a way only first world military 8 106988 Herald AR 1213-v10.

It is no coincidence that the 2012 riots, the Arab spring, troubles in the Ukraine and other trouble spots have followed in quick succession.
Edward Snowden and Wikileaks have alerted the world to the power of US intelligence.
How do governments and companies react?
All these issues will lead to increased expenditure.
In addition IBMs sharp decline in sales to China almost certainly reflects politics rather than the economy.
UK The UK portfolio delivered a total return of 24.7%.
Although this was strong in absolute terms, the Numis Smaller Companies Index excluding investment trusts but including AIM was even stronger at 30.9%.
However the technology subsector only appreciated 25.5%, media 28.1% and electronic and electrical equipment 34.6%.
In contrast the sectors in industrials and consumer goods returned over 40%, reflecting cyclical recovery.
From 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2013, Heralds UK portfolio returned 124.9%, versus the Numis Index return of 54.8% over that period.
The major takeovers during the year were Ffastfill, Andor and Delcam.
During the year the fund invested a total of 30m in 46 primary placings on the London Stock Exchange.
Of these, twelve were initial public offerings.
At last the market is receptive to new issues, and there appears to be a backlog of potential further offerings because the market was virtually closed for six years until September.
There is a natural lifecycle, and Herald has always taken small positions in early stage loss making companies.
There have been some interesting such companies recently, including a number with innovative new products.
In total over the life of the fund 279m has been invested as primary capital, which is significant in relation to net outside capital gross funds raised less buybacks of 57m.
After the strong performance the valuations seem less compelling which begs the question - is it time to take profits?
Reassuringly the UK portfolio is still on a p e profitable companies only of 15.3x, which in comparison to valuations in other sectors and the wider market is not challenging, and reasonable by historic standards.

indd 9 05 03 2014 09:01 INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT continued NORTH AMERICA The North American portfolio had a return of 37.3%.
The Sterling total return of the Russell 2000 Technology Index was 38.6%.
There were several significant takeovers, at useful premiums, of long held investments - in particular MIPS, Retalix, Websense, Keynote and Exactarget.
In aggregate cash bids totalled 21.5m.
There was exceptional value in March and cash was invested, but unfortunately the proceeds of takeovers arrived after the rally had begun.
Since then certain stocks which are not in our portfolio have been carried by momentum to valuations that struggle to make sense in terms of discounting future value.
Many of these, such as the social media companies, have always been out of Heralds size remit, others are small companies on large valuations, which we have underowned for market size reasons, and the desire to invest on valuations that can be justified by future cash flows.
The SAAS companies software as a service is an area where we could have made better returns.
EMEA The EMEA Europe Middle East and Africa portfolio has performed well 59.0%.
This small portfolio has reflected strong returns on Opera Software and Nordic Semi in Norway and BE Semiconductor and Ordina in the Netherlands.
Far East The Far East portfolio has lagged the UK, North American and EMEA portfolios with a return of 10.7%.
However, this is a good return relative to relevant benchmarks in Taiwan 5.0% and Korea -1.35%.
We have deliberately had a relatively small holding in the Far East because, as a manufacturing centre for the technology sector, it does not have the proprietary strength of western countries and has borne the brunt of the weakness in hardware sales this year.
Summary We continue to view the sector with enthusiasm and are coming to terms with higher valuations having been spoilt by such low values for several years.
At last the market has normalised, there is much better liquidity and the smaller companies in TMT seem to be coming back into favour.
Furthermore, there is also a flow of new companies in the UK with a requirement for capital and appealing valuations, and a continuing stream of takeover bids both in the UK and particularly in the US at worthwhile premiums.
