Results for the Year Financial Highlights The strong underlying results for the year ended 29 September 2013 reflect the combination of improving market conditions and progress we have made on delivering our strategic objectives.
Adjusted profit before tax grew by 22% to 52.3m from 42.9m last year and adjusted diluted EPS grew by 19% to 14.9p per share from 12.5p last year.
The underlying adjusted profit growth was driven by increased income, 9% higher than prior year, together with improving efficiency as reflected by fixed operating cost growth being limited to 3% and the increase in adjusted profit before tax margin to 18.5% from 16.5% in the prior year.
Profit before tax for the year was 28.6m 2012: 29.9m, a 4% decline on the prior year.
This was a result of significant restructuring costs incurred in the year and material provisions for onerous contracts which are explained below.

18 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Business review Reconciliation of adjusted income and operating expenses to financial statements 2013 2012 m m Income per financial statements 283.7 269.5 Reclassification of items previously reported as operating expenses 9.1 Adjusted income used for purposes of financial highlights and strategic report 283.7 260.4 Other operating costs per financial statements 83.4 94.2 Reclassification of items previously reported as income 9.1 Adjusted other operating expenses used for purposes of financial highlights and 83.4 85.1 strategic report Prior to the introduction of RDR 1 January 2013, Brewin Dolphin collected income from client portfolios on behalf of intermediaries which it recorded as income with an offsetting expense.
Post RDR, intermediaries are required to collect and record their income directly from clients and consequently this income is no longer recorded in Brewin Dolphins results.
This has no impact on reported profit, however we have chosen to adjust the comparative figures for 2012 to be on a post RDR basis as we believe this offers a more fair and appropriate analysis of underlying income and cost trends.
Income Total income grew by 9% to 283.7m 2012: 260.4m in the year and is analysed as follows: 2013 2012 m m Change Commissions 93.5 84.1 Fees 152.0 121.4 1 Core income 245.5 205.5 19% Financial Planning 11.7 9.3 Trail 14.8 29.2 Interest 11.7 16.4 Other income 38.2 54.9 -30% Total income 283.7 260.4 9% 1 Core income is defined as income derived from fees and commissions charged on management and or advice and execution activities relating to client portfolios.
19 Strategic Report continued Core income from our Discretionary, Advisory and Execution Only services, grew strongly by 19% to 245.5m 2012: 205.5m.
This was driven by a combination of increased average client fund balances due to higher market levels and continued inflows, and improved returns as a result of the move to new pricing structures.
Income and yield by service type 2013 2012 m m Change Income Discretionary 192.7 156.3 23% Advisory Managed 27.5 23.3 18% Advisory Dealing 7.2 12.8 -44% Total Managed Advised 227.4 192.4 18% Execution Only 18.1 13.1 38% Total 245.5 205.5 19% Yield Bps Bps Discretionary 96 91 Advisory Managed 56 46 Advisory Dealing 29 42 Execution Only 30 26 20 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Business review The strong growth in FUM and improved yield resulted in a 23% increase in income to 192.7m 2012: 156.3m from our Discretionary service.
Despite lower levels of Advisory Managed FUM, overall income from Managed Advised services increased by 18% due to the improved yield from re-pricing.
The decline in income from advisory dealing resulted from the steep decline in funds under this category as a result of the service review and re-pricing initiative.
Overall fees and commissions grew, with fees growing particularly strongly, up 25% to 152.0m 2012: 121.4m as a result of the growth in Discretionary services and the on-going introduction of fees to all Advisory Managed accounts in line with new pricing structures.
Aggregate other income declined by 30% to 38.2m from 54.9m in 2012, primarily due to the planned significant reduction in trail income which decreased to 14.8m 2012: 29.2m as a result of our initiative to switch to trail free clean units.
Since the beginning of this year all new funds have been purchased on a clean basis post the implementation of RDR.
Income from financial planning activities grew by 26% during the year to 11.7m 2012: 9.3m as a result of our strategy to offer an integrated wealth management service.
Net interest earned from the management of client cash deposits reduced by 29% in the year to 11.7m 2012: 16.4m as a result of reduced interest rates on deposits available from our banks, whilst maintaining interest rates payable on client cash balances.
Costs Reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses to financial statements 2013 2012 m m Change Fixed staff cost 105.3 98.7 7% Underlying non-staff costs 84.2 89.7 -6% Insurance recovery 0.8 4.7 Non-staff costs -2% 83.4 85.0 Total adjusted fixed operating costs 188.7 183.7 3% Variable staff costs 43.7 34.6 26% Redundancy costs 4.8 0.6 Additional FSCS levy 1.1 0.5 Onerous contracts 6.2 Total exceptional costs 12.1 1.1 Amortisation of client relationships 12.5 11.9 Total adjusted operating expenses 257.0 231.3 1 Reclassification 9.1 As reported in Income Statement 257.0 240.4 1 Reconciliation of adjusted income and operating expenses to financial statements page 19 21 Strategic Report continued Significant progress has been made in bringing costs under control during the year.
Fixed staff costs Fixed staff cost growth was limited to 7% year on year, below the rate of income growth, a reversal of previous years trends and contributing to the improved operating margin.
This was achieved through a combination of hiring discipline together with reduced run rate central function costs following the restructuring exercise undertaken during the year.
The exceptional costs associated with this are described below.
Variable staff costs Variable staff costs increased by 26% to 43.7m 2012: 34.6m.
The increase was driven primarily by the rise in adjusted profit before variable staff costs 24% to which the majority of variable staff cost is linked, and managements decision to increase the overall level of variable staff compensation to assist in staff retention.
The overall ratio of total fixed and variable staff costs to adjusted income increased accordingly during the year to 53% from 51% in 2012.
Non-staff costs A significant reduction in underlying non-staff costs of 6% year on year was achieved, falling to 84.2m from 89.7m in 2012.
This was due to tighter controls around discretionary expenditure, in particular in areas such as marketing, advertising and legal consulting fees, and the reduction contributed significantly to the improvement in operating margin during the year.
Insurance recovery During the year the Group reached final settlement with its insurers with respect to certain material past claims relating to insured losses incurred in prior years.
This resulted in an additional 0.8m 2012: 4.7m recovery being recognised in the year.
Exceptional costs Redundancy costs Redundancy costs of 4.8m 2012: 0.6m incurred in the year primarily resulted from two organisational restructurings: 1 In March various head office functions were restructured in order to better service business needs and reduce costs.
This resulted in approximately 3.0m in redundancy payments and reduced central functions headcount by approximately 100.
This resulted in an ongoing staff costs saving of 6.0m per annum.
2 During the second half, a rationalisation of the branch network was undertaken, resulting in the closure of our offices in Inverness, Teesside, Hereford and Swansea.
The management of clients together with some of the staff moved to local larger offices where we consider we are better able to serve our clients needs in the longer term.
A further 1.4m of redundancy payments were incurred as a consequence, with run rate savings to branch staff costs to be felt from 2014 onwards.
Onerous contracts provisions Provisions in respect of onerous contracts totalling 6.2m, 5.7m relating to surplus property space which may not be able to be continually sub-let, were made in the year.
Of this, approximately 0.5m relates to the remaining lease commitments of up to four years on recently closed offices, 4.3m relates to lease commitments of up to 20 years on excess space resulting from the consolidation of operations into one office in Edinburgh, and 0.9m from excess space resulting from the consolidation into one office in London.
The 0.4m non-property related provision relates to software applications no longer being used as a result of the central functions restructuring.
The maximum total future undiscounted exposure resulting from the aggregate of the onerous property leases is approximately 23.0m.
Exceptional gain During the year the Group sold its remaining stake in NPLUS1 Singer Ltd realising an exceptional gain on disposal of 0.9m.

This will ensure that dividend growth can be aligned with earnings growth without material short term reductions to tangible equity.

In addition to underlying cash generated from operations of 46.4m 2012: 44.5m, the large increase was the result primarily of the equity capital raising in May 2013, generating net proceeds of 38.6m, in addition to positive working capital movement of 17.6m in the year.
Underlying free cash flow increased to 24.6m from 14.1m in 2012, due to lower total capital investment in the year 21.8m, versus 2012: 30.4m.
Upfront cash spent on acquiring teams of investment managers and their client relationships declined to 3.4m from 6.9m in 2012 due to the significant absence of further team hires in the year beyond what was already in progress at 30 September 2012.
Investment in fixed assets declined to 4.5m in the year 2012: 7.4m, primarily due to lower spend on computer hardware in support of the implementation of the new core software operating system.
Development of the new core settlement system which has been underway for 18 months, reflected in total 16.8m further capital investment in computer hardware and software development costs to bring the new software into use.
In addition to 17m spent in 2012, total cumulative investment in the project is approximately 34m.
It is anticipated an additional 20m will be spent over the course of the next 18 months to bring the implementation to a successful completion.
Dividends paid in the period came to 18.1m 2012: 16.9m.
There has been a cash outflow from the purchase of shares for the Share Incentive Plan SIP of 0.2m and nil for the Deferred Profit Share Scheme DPSP during the year, 2012: 1.9m SIP and DPSP.
The Group instructed the trustees of the DPSP to purchase 4m of shares after the end of the financial year.
Investment in new technology to improve the quality of our client service, as well as lowering the cost of delivering that service, is a key initiative to achieve the strategic priority of improving operational efficiency.
We will continue to develop ways of investing and successfully integrating new software solutions into our business model.
This will result in future capital investment, though at a lower level than the current run rate, once the core system is fully in place.
Free cash flow as a proportion of underlying earnings should therefore increase over time as earnings grow.
24 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Business review Resources available to the Group Our primary assets, in addition to our employees, are the value of: 1 Client relationships acquired via introduction from new teams of investment managers hired: 2 Fixed tangible assets, i. e. investment in fixtures and fittings in our offices and in communications and technology hardware to support our operations: and 3 Purchase, development and configuration of new software applications to support our operations.
We invest across all three categories to develop the assets of the business, securing growth and preserving and improving our operational efficiency.
As our strategy has changed in recent years from focusing solely on growth by acquiring additional client relationships to seeking also to improve operational efficiency, we have been investing more in the development of new software and less on acquiring teams of investment managers.
Pension Fund The actuarial loss on the pension fund this year was 2.2m 2012: 5.1m.
Under IAS19, large annual fluctuations can occur.
The Group has agreed to make additional pension contributions of 3m per annum with the aim of paying the deficit off, over the next seven years.
The net pension deficit reduced by 0.6m during the year to 9.2m 2012: 9.8m.
This primarily resulted from better than expected investment returns on assets exceeding the increase in the actuarial value of liabilities.
Capital Structure, Treasury Policy, Liquidity and Capital Requirement At 29 September 2013 the Group had net assets of 221.6m 2012: 162.7m.
Net assets excluding intangible assets and shares to be issued of 109.1m 2012: 61.1m broadly represent the Groups capital for regulatory purposes.
These net assets were largely represented by net cash and cash equivalents of 137m 2012: 72m, including 20.3m 2012: 23.8m of client settlement money.
The Group has an agreed unsecured overdraft facility of 15m 2012: 15m.
At the period end the Group had a surplus of net assets for regulatory capital adequacy purposes of 60.5m 2012: 11.4m, the increase is mainly attributable to the capital raised during the placing in May.
The Group aims to hold at least 90% of both clients and Groups money only at major UK clearers.
Client money is segregated under rules set out in the FCA Client Asset Source Book.
Client stock is segregated and held in our nominee companies.
Stock is settled via the Crest System which is owned by Euroclear, a highly rated bank, and, in the case of foreign stock, the Bank of New York Mellon.
Market risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk are small and set out in detail in note 26 to the financial statements.
25 Strategic Report continued Post Balance Sheet Events There have been no material post balance sheet events.
Accounting Policies There were no changes in accounting policies during the year.
Significant Relationships No client provides more than 2% of the Groups revenue.
The Group has two main suppliers of computer software.
Going Concern The Group has substantial operational gearing arising from its fixed cost base: this is mitigated by variable staff costs which if income falls would reduce variable costs.
Cash balances ranged between 28m and 124m over the year.
The Groups business activities, performance and position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report which also describes the financial position of the Group including its liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 26 to the financial statements.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of possible adverse changes in trading performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements.
26 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Business review F. Principal Risks and Uncertainties Risks The Groups principal risks and uncertainties together with the key mitigants and controls are set out on pages 28 and 29.
Details of the risk framework and governance are set out in the Risk Committee report pages 4445.
The origins and nature of the Groups principal risks change over time and are the result of, among other factors, the market environment and the Groups strategy.
As discussed above when explaining the Groups current strategy, management takes careful consideration of the risk implications of different strategic initiatives.
The strategic refocus instigated by the new management team has in part been driven by the appreciation that the Groups risk profile was increasing over time as a result of external factors such as increased regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures as well as from the Groups former strategy of inorganic growth.
The current strategy is aimed at managing and where possible reducing the operational, business and strategic risks over time.
For example, initiatives already underway, such as the standardisation of the business model and withdrawal from certain activities and services, should result in reduced risks.
Equally, the increased focus on organic growth will limit the addition of further risk relating to acquisitions.
Risks resulting from the past strategy, however, may remain.
In the long term, successful implementation of the strategy and realisation of strategic priorities will reduce the Groups strategic risk by making it more competitive and better able to continue to prosper in a challenging market environment.
In the short term, however, strategic risks may well increase due to the challenges of delivering the business transformation itself.
In particular, the inability to implement change due to cultural inertia, vested interests or poor project management is an emergent risk as the refocused strategy is implemented.
