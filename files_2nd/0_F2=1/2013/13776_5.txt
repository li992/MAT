Chief Executives review continued Our market segments The relationship we have with over six million customers, either directly or through our business partners, gives us valuable insight into their needs We understand that these needs typically change as businesses grow, which is why we divide our market into three segments.
Each segment has different characteristics and requirements, which provides us with a range of opportunities to bring great products and services to our customers.
To help us identify, measure and understand the challenges faced by small and medium sized businesses, we carry out an annual survey called The Sage Business Index.
This year we spoke to over 11,700 business decision makers in 17 countries and asked them for their views on a range of issues, including their attitude to risk, the availability of bank finance, the global economy and their confidence in the future of their own businesses.
It was encouraging to see the results of this survey indicating business confidence is at a three-year high.
