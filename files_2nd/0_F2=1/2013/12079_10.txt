45 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2013 Strategic report Segmental performance continued An important differentiator for Petrofac is our focus on local delivery.
By recruiting and training local staff, we are better able to enter new markets and cement long-term customer relationships.
By developing local skills, we can also work more cost-effectively and progressively grow our global capability.
