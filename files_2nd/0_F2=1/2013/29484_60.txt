The Committee considered these three groups when setting the strategic targets for 2013, together with other objectives set out in the 2013 business plan.
In serving our clients well, developing our employees and the Partnership for the future and striving to improve the effectiveness of our organisation, we will be best placed to meet our longterm business objectives, and create additional value for our shareholders.
We also focus on the importance of safe and sustainable growth through prudent management of risk and the highest standards of regulatory compliance.
The Committee assessed how well the Executive team had performed in relation to the objectives set at the start of the year.
The Committee did not place fixed weightings on the factors assessed, but made a judgement based on the Committees view of the relative importance and impact of those factors over the course of the year.
For some factors the Committee was able to put in place quantitative metrics, and for others more qualitative judgments were made, depending on the nature of the strategic objective.
As regards client satisfaction, the Committee took into account the following objectives: The independent client satisfaction survey results for 2013 were very strong and in some categories the results were the highest achieved since the annual survey began in 2007.
In summary, 84% of clients rated their overall satisfaction with SJP as 8 or more out of 10 compared to 73% in 2012 and 81% of clients would be happy to recommend SJP to their contacts compared to 70% in 2012.
In the annual Wealth Account survey, 88% of clients rated the value of their relationship with their SJP Partner as 8 or more out of 10.
Clients continued to benefit from above average performance across the majority of funds, over a three, five and ten year period.
Over the ten year period 70% of funds outperformed their peer group.
The Group won a number of industry awards, further details of which are set out on page 39, many of which were voted on by clients.
The above factors, together with strong service levels, generally, contributed to excellent retention of funds under management, with 95% of existing funds being retained see page 32 and an 8% reduction in complaint levels compared to 2012.
