The Board is committed to maximising shareholder value and regularly reviews the efficiency of its balance sheet and the expected ongoing cash requirements of the business.
In light of this, the Board has concluded a share buyback of up to $50 million is appropriate, which was announced on 26 February 2014.
This buyback includes the remaining $7.2 million of the $25 million announced in July 2013, that has not yet been utilised.
We intend to undertake this buyback during the course of 2014.
