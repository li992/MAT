OECD oil consumption was 40 up slightly in 2013, rising for the first time since 2010.

Creating our North American advantaged renery We are creating a portfolio of advantaged reneries in North America.
At our Whiting renery weve commissioned all the major units for our largest project in recent history, helping us move towards that goal.
We built or recongured almost every process unit as part of the modernization project.
This included new crude distillation and coking units and improved hydro-treating sulphur recovery and increasing coking capacity.
Across the 1,400 acre site we installed around 380 miles of pipe more than enough to run from London, England to Glasgow in Scotland.
This work has improved productivity and safety at the renery, creating the potential to increase our heavy sour crude processing.
