qxp 18 07 2013 10:22 Page 2 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Chairmans Statement I have pleasure in presenting my Report and our Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2013.
This year, the UK has seen a continuation of the difficult operating conditions to which we have become accustomed in recent times.
In the USA however, our experience has been more encouraging with a move to a more normal trading environment.
Against this background it is pleasing to be able to report an uplift in value of our investment property holdings of 12.2% and a profit before tax of 111.7 million: both represent a significant increase on last years levels.
Investment properties The table below shows a summary of the valuation of our investment property: Valuation Percentage March 2013 change m Commercial property UK 639.0 12.7% USA 44.9 16.1% Residential property UK 464.3 8.9% USA 262.4 16.8% Total 1,410.6 12.2% Revaluation Once again in the UK we have seen strong growth from our Central London residential properties but only modest growth in the value of residential properties outside the London area.
The net result of these movements was an 8.7% uplift 2012 3.8%.
This years revaluation of UK commercial property has benefited from a significant uplift in the value of Africa House, WC2 where the major refurbishment programme is close to completion.
In general the pattern has been for increases in London commercial property values to be counterbalanced by downward movement in values in the provinces.
In aggregate, UK commercial properties produced a net upward movement upon revaluation of 3.1% 2012 3.0% reduction.
The overall net result of the revaluation of all UK properties was an uplift of 54.9 million, equivalent to 5.5% 2012 0.2% reduction.
In the USA a combination of strong demand and improving rents in the residential sector and improved tenant operating income and capitalisation rates in the commercial sector has resulted in uplifts in property values in all of the areas in which we operate.
New York properties in particular continue to show significant growth.
In total the valuation increase in our USA portfolio was $43.0 million 2012 $29.7 million equivalent to 10.1% 2012 7.7%.
