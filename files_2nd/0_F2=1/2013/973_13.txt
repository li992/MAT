The Mantos Blancos and Mantoverde mines are wholly owned Mt and we hold a 50.1% interest in AngloAmerican Sur AASur, China 9.2 which includes the Los Bronces and El Soldado mines and Europe 3.4 the Chagres smelter.
We also hold a 44% shareholding in Rest of World 2.4 the Collahuasi mine.

India 0.5 Brazil 0.5 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Source: Wood Mackenzie Global copper Coppers principal use is in the wire and cable markets short term outlook, January 2014 because of the metals electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance.
Applications that make use of coppers electrical conductivity, such as wire including the wiring used in The industry is capital-intensive and is likely to become buildings, cables and electrical connectors, make up more so as high grade surface deposits are exhausted and approximately 60% of total global demand.
The metals deeper and or lower grade deposits are developed in more corrosion-resistant properties find numerous applications challenging locations.
Combined with the need to develop in the construction industry, particularly plumbing pipe and infrastructure in new geographies, greater economies of roof sheeting, which accounts for a further 20% of demand.

Coppers thermal conductivity also makes it suitable for use Scarcity of water in some countries, such as Chile and Peru, in heat-transfer applications such as air conditioning and are also likely to necessitate the construction of capitaland refrigeration, which constitute some 10% of total demand.
Other applications include structural and aesthetic uses.
During the period 2000-2012, China increased its share Access to quality orebodies, located in regions providing of first-use refined metal consumption from 12% to an stable political, social and regulatory support for responsible estimated 41%.
Demand growth there continued to and sustainable mining, is likely to continue to be the key increase faster than in the rest of the world, so that in 2013, factor distinguishing project returns and mine profitability.
Chinas share of refined demand was estimated to have Such orebodies are scarce, however, and it will be reached 44%.
increasingly necessary for mining companies to develop assets in more challenging environments.
STRATEGY With no fundamental technological shifts expected in the Coppers strategy is to generate industry-leading returns short to medium term, forecast long term demand is likely by safely and sustainably creating value for all stakeholders to be underpinned by growth in coppers electrical uses, through operational excellence, disciplined growth and an particularly wire and cable in construction, automobiles optimised portfolio.
The business continues to explore for and electricity infrastructure.
The key growth area will low operating cost and long life development opportunities continue to be the developing world, led by China and, in and to evaluate the longer term project options in its the longer term, other Asian economies including India, portfolio, including Quellaveco and the Los Bronces District.
where industrialisation and urbanisation on a large scale continue to propel copper demand growth.
The intensity In September 2013, AngloAmerican gave notice of its of copper consumption is still at a high level in the case of decision to withdraw from the Pebble copper project in China, while in India it is on an upward trajectory.
As a result, the investment in Pebble was written contrast with the advanced economies and their much off in full, resulting in a charge of $311 million, including lower levels of intensity.
In spite of near term supply growth that may well be higher than that of the past six or seven years, constraints on the supply side are likely to prove a structural feature of the market.
Such constraints will be driven by continuing declines in ore grades at maturing existing operations, a lack of capital investment and under-exploration in new projects, as well as political and environmental challenges in many current and prospective copper areas.

Following the SAG 3 stator motor replacement and repowering in the second quarter of the year, plant stability and mill throughput performance have improved significantly.
Production also benefited from higher than planned grades.
Production at El Soldado decreased by 4% to 51,500 tonnes, owing to lower grades.
The development of the next major phase of ore supply has slowed as mining activities intersected a geological fault, impacting ore availability in the last quarter of the year.
The lack of ore has been partially mitigated by the processing of slag from the nearby Chagres smelter.
