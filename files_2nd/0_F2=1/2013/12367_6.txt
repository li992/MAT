Additionally, as a result of the Boards strategic review, capital Silver sales lagged behind production in the first half of the expenditure was optimised with savings of approximately Processing year, mainly due to increased concentrate in transit inventories US$60 million in 2013.
Key decisions included: Ore processed increased by 10% in 2013 and totalled 10.7 Mt.
However, the gap was closed in the second half The increase was driven by further capacity expansion at the the Sopka heap leaching project was postponed.

the greenfield brownfield exploration budget was reviewed and the launch of the Mayskoye processing plant in April 2013, and re-prioritised.
We have continued to invest in key which milled 488 Kt by the end of the year.
Our mature mines Successful completion of key capital projects development projects such as Svetloye, Maminskoye, demonstrated stable performance in terms of throughput Amursk POX Kutyn and the expansion of Albazino, although the pace and Albazino mine, as a result of fide-bottlenecking, increased Despite the unexpected setback in the ramp-up schedule of development has been slowed down and key project its capacity to 1.6 Mtpa of ore by the end of the year.

This result was achieved through: the launch of the high-grade of the water treatment unit in the third quarter of the year.

Another highlight of the year was the successful launch production plans and only a minor impact on the medium-term and ramp-up of the Mayskoye processing plant.
