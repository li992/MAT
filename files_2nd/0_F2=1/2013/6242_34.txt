We also conduct intensive and on-going localand regional exploration to replace and expand the resource base, and plan to increase recovery rates by processing tailings.

We expect silver ore grades to average 280 g t in 2014, with acontinual gradual decline over the next five years to the average ore grade in reserves, currently 271 g t. In contrast, gold production in 2013 increased 11.9% due to higher ore grades and recovery rates.
