This information is contained within the Strategic Report over pages 6 to 30.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS The results for the period are set out in the Financial Statements on pages 42 to 80.

GOING CONCERN The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Investment Adviser Report.
The financial position of the Group, its cash ows and its liquidity position are described in the Investment Adviser Report.
In particular, the current economic conditions have created a number of risks and uncertainties for the Group and these are set out in the Risks and Risk Management section on pages 8 to 11.
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group and the exposure of the Group to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are discussed in note 21 of the Financial Statements.
The Group continues to meet Group and individual entity requirements and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Groups cash resources.
In February 2013, JLIF secured a three year 150 million multicurrency revolving credit facility with Lloyds TSB Bank plc, Royal Bank of Scotland plc and ING Bank NV.
This facility replaced the existing 75 million facility with Royal Bank of Scotland.
The facility will be used primarily to fund acquisitions, and will be repaid through raising equity in the market.
The facility is intended to be additional resource and not structural nancing.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group had net current assets of 22.3 million and the revolving credit facility was undrawn and available for future acquisitions and working capital.
JLIF has sufficient cash balances to meet other current obligations as they fall due while all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
The Directors have reviewed Group forecasts and projections which cover a period of not less than 12 months from the date of the report, taking into account reasonably-possible changes in investment and trading performance, which show that the Group has sufficient financial resources.
The Group has sufficient financial resources together with long term contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
On the basis of this review, and after making due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
