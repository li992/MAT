Strategic Report Flight Support ASIG The worlds leading independent refueller Revenue 2013 2012 Inc dec $m $m % USA 293.9 276.2 6% Europe & ROW 113.6 92.7 23% Total 407.5 368.9 10% Performance ASIGs revenue increased by 10% to $407.5 million 2012: $368.9 million despite the reduction in commercial aviation movements by 1% in North America and by 2% in Europe.
Half of the revenue increase related to the acquisition of PLH Aviation Services and Dryden Air Services in Canada that completed in August 2012 and the half year impact of the acquisition of gategroups cleaning and fide-icing business in London and Dublin that completed in June 2013.
The balance of the increase was organic.
Under a new leadership team, ASIG has reinvigorated its focus on operational effectiveness, ensuring that it strives to maintain the highest safety standards, service differentiation and long-term is the lowest total cost quality service provider in its selected markets.
Incremental short-term costs incurred to support this effort impacted ASIGs financial performance in 2013, but have supported operational improvement in the second half and a number of encouraging new contract wins for 2014.
ASIGs industry leading position as an into-plane re-fueller and manager of fuel farms was reinforced with the addition of a new fuel farm operation at Nashville International Airport and the successful renewal of three fuel farm management contracts.
Furthermore, in February 2014 ASIG agreed to acquire the assets of Skytanking USA, Inc. an independent provider of aviation fuel handling services for a net cash payment of $16.8 million.
Under the terms of the transaction, ASIG will divest its airport fuel operations at Linz Airport LNZ and Klagenfurt Airport KLU in Austria along with its 50% joint venture operations with Skytanking at Munich Airport MUC and Vienna International Airport VIE to Skytanking.
The transaction is subject to customary approvals and is expected to complete in the first half of 2014.
Upon completion the deal will create a further seven sole source commercial into-plane refuelling airports for ASIG in the US.
In August ASIG was awarded the contract for common check-in services for zones A and D of London Heathrows new Terminal 2 operation, which includes 14 airline customers.
In addition, ASIG has also been awarded a number of ground handling contracts at Terminal 2.
Terminal 2 will become operational in the summer of 2014.
These contract awards build on ASIGs prior acquisition of gategroups London cleaning and fide-icing business and the acquisition of SGS at London Heathrow, supporting our strategy of achieving critical mass by line of business at hub airports.
