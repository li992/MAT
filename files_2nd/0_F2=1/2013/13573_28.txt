5 On 2 January 2012, the Group contributed its interest in Bergen Engines AS to Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH RRPSH previously Engine Holding GmbH, a company jointly held by Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG.
Under the terms of agreement with Daimler, Rolls-Royce retained certain rights such that Bergen Engines continued to be classified as a subsidiary and consolidated.
6 As part of the RRPSH shareholders agreement, Daimler has the option to sell its shares in RRPSH to Rolls-Royce for a period of six years from 1 January 2013.
The initial fair value of the exercise price of this option in respect of Bergen Engines AS 166m was recognised in 2012 and that amount in respect of RRPS 1,432m has been recognised in 2013 and charged to retained earnings.
In addition, 45m of the initial recognition of the put option on NCI relating to Bergen Engine AS, recognised in 2012, has been reclassified from NCI to retained earnings.
Subsequent movements in the value of this liability are included in the income statement, but excluded from the underlying results.
7 On 1 January 2013, the Group exercised rights in RRPSH that resulted in Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG RRPS formerly Tognum AG being classified as a subsidiary and consolidated see note 25.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 80 Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies The Company The consolidated financial statements of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013 consist of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interest in jointly controlled and associated entities.
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance In accordance with European Union EU regulations, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, as adopted for use in the EU effective at 31 December 2013 Adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices GAAP.
These are set out on pages 124 to 126 and the accounting policies in respect of Company financial statements are set out on page 125.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRS requires the revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis most significantly post-retirement scheme liabilities are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits and on a going concern basis as described on page 72.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pound sterling which is the Companys functional currency.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period: the key areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty are described below.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Groups significant accounting policies are set out on the following pages.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and by all Group entities.
Amendment to accounting policy As explained in the Chief Financial Officers review on page 11, following discussions with the Conduct Committee of the FRC, the Group has reassessed its policy for the recognition of entry fees received under Risk and Revenue Sharing Arrangements RRSAs.
Whilst the impact on our historical results is not significant, the directors believe that the change represents an improvement in the policy.
In prior years, entry fees were recognised as other operating income when they were received, on the basis that this matched it to the recognition of non-recurring development costs incurred on behalf of the workshare partner.
This policy has been revised, to reflect better the fact that some of these non-recurring development costs are capitalised.
Under the amended policy, where the relevant costs in the development programme are capitalised ie development costs incurred between engine certification and entry into service and certification costs and participation fees paid to airframers, an equivalent portion of the entry fee received is deferred and recognised as the related costs are amortised after entry into service.
In addition, the amount of entry fees recognised in the year will be presented as a contribution to research and development expenses, rather than other operating income.
As required by IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, this change has been made retrospectively: the impact of the change in policy in 2012 was to increase profit before tax by 25million and to reduce net assets at 31 December 2011 and 2012 by 184million and 170million respectively.
Had the policy not been amended, profit before tax in 2013 would have been 39million higher and at 31 December 2013 net assets 208million higher.
The FRC Conduct Committees view is that the RRSA contract cannot be divided into separate development and production phases, as the fees and development components received by the Group during the development phase are exchanged for the obligation to pay the supplier a pre-determined share of any sales receipts during the production phase.
On this basis, the entry fees received would be deferred in their entirety and recognised over the period of production.
As explained in the Chief Financial Officers review, on page 11, the FRC Conduct Committee has confirmed that, in view of the change to the policy and the additional disclosure the Group has made, it does not intend to pursue its consideration of this accounting policy further.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 81 1 Accounting policies continued Key areas of judgement The directors consider the potential key areas of judgements required to be made in applying the Groups accounting policies to be: Assessing whether or not the Group controls Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH RRPSH requires judgement.
The shares of RRPSH are held equally by the Group and Daimler AG and the rights of each shareholder are encapsulated in shareholder agreements which set out, amongst other things, key matters on which the Group has the casting vote at the Shareholders Committee of RRPSH.
These most important matters subject to casting vote which are relevant to assessing whether RRPSH is controlled include a setting the annual budget and operating and financial plan, b appointing, removing and setting the remuneration of key management personnel though removal of the CEO or the CFO requires joint agreement, c entering into contracts in the ordinary course of business and d establishing management procedures and responsibilities.
The Group considers that these provisions are sufficient to give it control over RRPSH.
Daimler AG has protective rights covering matters such as: i significant changes to the scale, scope and financing of RRPSHs business: ii certain significant supplier relationships: and iii changes to contractual arrangements between RRPSH and Rolls-Royce.
These are not considered sufficient to prevent the Group from directing the activities of RRPSH.
A large proportion of the Groups activities relate to long-term aftermarket contracts.
The determination of appropriate accounting policies for recognising revenue and costs in respect of these contracts requires judgement: i whether a long-term aftermarket contract is linked, for accounting purposes, to the related sale of original equipment where the long-term aftermarket contract is agreed or agreed in principle at the same time as the original equipment contract, these are considered to be linked for accounting purposes and treated as a single contract or whether it should be treated separately: and ii the appropriate measure of stage of completion of the contract this will vary depending on the precise nature of the arrangements.
Where the service provided is assessed to be continuous, the stage of completion is measured by reference to the flying hours, or equivalent, under the contract.
Other aftermarket contracts are overhaul event based and the stage of completion is measured accordingly.
The Group has significant intangible assets.
In deciding whether certain intangible assets should be recognised, judgement is required: i IAS 38 Intangible Assets requires that internally-generated development costs should only be recognised if strict criteria are met, in particular relating to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.
The directors consider that, due to the complex nature of new equipment programmes, these criteria are not met until relatively late in the programme Civil aerospace programmes represent 54percent of development costs: for these, the criteria are generally satisfied at the time of the initial engine certification: ii on delivery of engines without a linked long-term aftermarket contract, the Group has contractual rights to supply aftermarket parts to the customers and its intellectual rights, warranty arrangements and, where relevant, statutory airworthiness or other regulatory requirements provide reasonable control over this supply.
Accordingly the directors consider that these rights meet the definition of an intangible asset in IAS 38.
However, the directors do not consider that it is possible to determine a reliable fair value for this intangible asset.
Accordingly, an intangible asset recoverable engine cost or REC is only recognised on the occasions where the contractual price of the engine is below the cost of manufacture and then only to the extent of this deficit, as this amount is a reliable value.
RRSAs with key suppliers workshare partners are a feature of our Civil aerospace business.
Under these contractual arrangements the key commercial objectives are that: i during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an engine by performing its own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee: and ii during the production phase it supplies components in return for a share of the programme revenues as a life of type supplier.
The share of development costs borne by the workshare partner and of the revenues it receives reflect a jointly agreed forecast of the proportionate cost of providing its production parts compared to the overall forecast manufacturing cost of the engine.
These arrangements are complex and have features that could be indicative of: a collaboration agreement, including sharing of risk and cost in a development programme: a long-term supply agreement: sharing of intellectual property: or a combination of these.
There is no directly applicable IFRS to determine an accounting policy for the recognition of entry fees of this nature in the income statement.
Consequently, in developing an accounting treatment for such entry fees that best reflects the commercial objectives of the contractual arrangement, the directors have analysed these features in the context of relevant accounting pronouncements including those of other standard setters where these do not conflict with IFRS and have weighed the importance of each feature in faithfully representing the overall commercial effect.
The most important considerations that need to be balanced are: the transfer of development risk: the workshare partner receiving little standalone value from the payment of the entry fee: and the overall effect being collaboration between the parties which falls short of being a joint venture as the Group control the programme.
Also important in the analysis is the fact that, whilst the Group and the workshare partner share risks and rewards through the life of the contract, these risks and rewards are very different during the development and production phases.
In this context, the entry fee might be considered to represent: an amount paid as an equalisation of development costs: a payment to secure a long-term supply arrangement: a purchase of intellectual property: or some combination thereof.
The accounting under these different scenarios could include: recognition of the entry fee to match the associated costs in the income statement: being spread over the life of the programme as a reduction in the cost of supply during production: or being spread over the time period of the access to the intellectual property by the workshare partner.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 82 Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued The directors consider that the most important features of the arrangement are the risk sharing and that the entry fee represents a contribution to the development costs that the Group incurs in excess of its proportionate programme share.
The key judgements taken in reaching this view are: the entry fee is determined by the parties on that basis and the contract specifies that, in the event that a derivative engine is to be developed further, entry fees will also be calculated on this basis: the workshare partners describe the entry fee in this way: although the workshare partner receives little stand-alone value from paying the entry fee, the entry fee together with its own development activities represent its aggregate investment in the collaboration: the amount of the entry fee does not include any amount in excess of that necessary to equalise forecast development costs: the Group is not on risk for the full development costs it incurs but for that amount less the entry fees received: and, as far as can be determined, this appears to be common industry accounting for arrangements of this type, under both Adopted IFRS and US accounting standards which we believe do not conflict with IFRS in this regard.
The resulting accounting policy described below represents the commercial effect of the contractual arrangements in that the Group recognises only those development costs to which it is exposed and thus reflects the significant transfer of development risk to the workshare partner and the costs of supply of parts during the production phase is measured at the workshare partners share of programme revenues which we consider to be a commercial fair value.
The directors do not consider that accounting which would result in entry fees only being recognised in the production phase would appropriately reflect the sharing of development risk.
Accordingly, the directors believe that the policy adopted best reflects the commercial objectives of the arrangements, the nature of the relationship with the workshare partner and is in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of financing support provided to customers.
In order to assess whether a provision should be recognised, judgement as to the likelihood of these crystallising is required.
This judgement is based on an assessment on the knowledge of the customers fleet plans, the underlying value of the security provided and, where appropriate, the customers creditworthiness.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the accounting policies, estimates are made in many areas: the actual outcome may differ from that calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are set out below.
The estimation of the relevant assets and liabilities involves the combination of a number of assumptions.
Sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes where this is appropriate and practicable.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation of Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG and put option on Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH The fair value of intangible assets of RRPS at 1 January 2013 involved the use of valuation techniques and the estimation of future cash flows to be generated by RRPS over a considerable period of time.
The Group engaged a specialist valuer to assist with these.
For a period of six years from 1 January 2013, the Group is obliged to acquire, at Daimler AGs option, the latters 50percent interest in RRPSH.
The estimated exercise price of this option has been recognised as a liability.
The exercise price of the option is based on averaging three valuations at the date the option is exercised, which are based on both internal metrics, requiring estimation of future performance of the business, and external metrics.
Forecasts and discount rates The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the Groups operations, in particular: The assessment of whether the goodwill and other intangible assets carrying value at 31 December 2013 1,864million arising on the consolidation of RRPSH is impaired is dependent of the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business.
These cash flows are based on the business plan jointly agreed by the shareholders.
The assessment as to whether there are any indications of impairment of development, participation, certification, recoverable engine costs and customer relationships recognised as intangible assets carrying values at 31 December 2013 2,499million, 31 December 2012 1,457million is dependent on estimates of cash flows generated by the relevant assets and the discount rate used to calculate a present value.
These estimates include the performance of long-term contractual arrangements as described below, as well as estimates for future market share, pricing and unit cost for uncontracted business.
The risk of impairment is generally higher for newer programmes and, for customer specific intangible assets RECs, for launch customers.
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements The Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods the most significant of these are long-term service arrangements in the Civil aerospace business.
The estimated revenues and costs are inherently imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: engine flying hours, time on wing and other operating parameters: the pattern of future maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred: and life cycle cost improvements over the term of the contracts.
The estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of non-recovery of any resulting contract balances.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 83 1 Accounting policies continued Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.
The accounting valuation, which was based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net deficit of 793million before deferred taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 445million.
The size of the net deficit is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes and to actuarial assumptions, which include price inflation, pension and salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic assumptions and the levels of contributions.
Further details are included in note 19.
Provisions As described in the accounting policy on page 87, the Group measures provisions carrying value at 31 December 2013 733million, 31 December 2012 461million at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.
Taxation The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to determine the tax charge included in the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The Group consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings together with the Groups share of the results of joint ventures and associates made up to 31 December.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to derive benefits from its activities.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
An associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and where the Group has a significant influence.
The results of joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Any subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or associates sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the dates of change of control.
Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.
Where the Group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group recognises a liability for the estimated exercise value of that option.
Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised in the income statement.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Adjustments are made to eliminate the profit or loss arising on transactions with joint ventures and associates to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Significant accounting policies Revenue recognition Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts, excluding value added taxes.
Sales of products both original equipment and spare parts are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment can be assured this is generally on delivery.
On occasion, the Group may participate in the financing of OE, most commonly by the provision of guarantees as described in note 18.
In such circumstances, the contingent obligations arising under these arrangements are taken into account in assessing when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
As described on page 81, a sale of OE at a contractual price below its cost of manufacture is considered to give rise to an intangible asset, a recoverable engine cost.
In these circumstances, revenue is recognised to the same value as the recoverable engine cost.
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date.
As described on page 81, the assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: flying hours or equivalent for long-term aftermarket arrangements where the service is provided on a continuous basis: costs incurred to the extent these relate to services performed up to the reporting date: or achievement of contractual milestones where relevant.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 84 Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued As described on page 81, sales of products and services are treated as though they are a single contract where these components have been negotiated as a single commercial package and are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently of each other and are considered to form a single transaction with an overall profit margin.
The total revenue is allocated between the two components such that the total agreed discount to list prices is allocated to revenue for each of the two components pro rata, based on the list prices.
This revenue is then recognised for each component on this basis as the products are delivered and services provided, as described above.
Where the contractual price of the OE component is below the revenue allocated from the combined arrangement, this will give rise to an asset included in amounts recoverable on contracts.
This asset reduces as services are provided, increases as costs are incurred, and reduces to zero by the end of the contract.
Where the overall balance is a liability, it is recognised in accruals and deferred income.
Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion of contracts, having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded revenue, are deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent that payments on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included in accruals and deferred income within trade and other payables.
The amount by which recorded revenue of long-term contracts is in excess of payments on account is classified as amounts recoverable on contracts and is separately disclosed within trade and other receivables.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements RRSAs As described on page 81, the Group enters into arrangements with certain workshare partners under which these suppliers: i contribute to the forecast costs of developing an engine by performing their own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee: and ii supply components for the production phase for which they receive consideration, which is an agreed proportion of the total programme revenues.
Both the suppliers contributions to the forecast non-recurring development costs and their consideration are determined by reference to their proportionate forecast scopes of supply relative to that of the engine overall.
Once the forecast costs and the scopes of supply have been agreed at the inception of the contract, each party is then accountable for its own incurred costs.
No accounting entries are recorded when the suppliers undertake development work or when development components are supplied.
Cash sums received are recognised in the income statement, as a reduction in research and development costs incurred, to match the expensing of the Groups related costs where the cash sums are received in advance of the related costs being expensed or where the related costs are capitalised as intangible assets, the recognition of the cash received is deferred in accruals and deferred income to match the recognition of the related expense or the amortisation of the related intangible asset respectively.
The payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme revenues for their production components are charged to cost of sales as programme revenues arise.
The Group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake development work or supply parts.
Such arrangements are considered to be financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are accounted for using the amortised cost method.
Government investment Where a government or similar body has previously invested in a development programme, the Group treats payments to that body as royalty payments, which are matched to related sales.
Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the related expenses that they are intended to compensate.
Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are included in the balance sheet as deferred income.
Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.
Interest Interest receivable payable is credited charged to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Taxation The tax charge credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax: Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement or other comprehensive income OCI as appropriate, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 85 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates of exposures in relation to tax audit issues.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be sustained.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of that benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
All provisions are included in current liabilities.
Foreign currency translation Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting Group undertaking foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate ruling at the year end.
Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange transactions and the retranslation of assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate ruling at the year end are taken into account in determining profit before taxation.
The trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year.
The assets and liabilities of overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the year end.
Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments, and from the translation of the profits or losses at average rates, are recognised in OCI.
The cumulative amount of exchange adjustments was, on transition to IFRS in 2004, deemed to be nil.
Financial instruments IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires the classification of financial instruments into separate categories for which the accounting requirement is different.
The Group has classified its financial instruments as follows: short-term investments are generally classified as available for sale: short-term deposits principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions, trade receivables and short-term investments not designated as available for sale are classified as loans and receivables: borrowings, trade payables, financial RRSAs, put options on NCI and C Shares are classified as other liabilities: and derivatives, comprising foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity swaps are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are recognised at the contract date and initially measured at fair value.
Their subsequent measurement depends on their classification.
Available for sale assets are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the income statement.
All other changes in fair value are taken to equity.
On disposal, the accumulated changes in value recorded in equity are included in the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost and not revalued except for changes in exchange rates and forecast contractual cash flows, which are included in the income statement unless they are included in a fair value hedge accounting relationship.
Where such a hedging relationship exists, the instruments are revalued in respect of the risk being hedged, with the change in value included in the income statement.
Fair value through profit or loss items are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value are included in the income statement unless the instrument is included in a cash flow hedge.
If the instruments are included in an effective cash flow hedging relationship, changes in value are taken to equity.
When the hedged forecast transaction occurs, amounts previously recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement.
Financial instruments are derecognised on expiry or when all contractual rights and obligations are transferred.
Hedge accounting The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts or commodity swaps held to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively.
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of transactions entered into to manage the fair value and cash flow exposures of its borrowings.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are held to manage the fair value exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and are designated as fair value hedges.
Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges of fixed and floating rate borrowings respectively.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 86 Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in the fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in the income statement.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is included in the income statement.
The amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement to match the recognition of the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, for cash flow hedges and if the forecast transaction remains probable, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The portion of a gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair value cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill.
Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other contingent liabilities.
Goodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value to the Group of the net of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not retrospectively adjusted to comply with Adopted IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous accounting policies.
Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Certification costs and participation fees Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new civil aero-engine aircraft combinations including payments made to airframe manufacturers for this and participation fees are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent that they can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the income statement over the programme life, up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the product.
Research and development In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets, expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as relating either to a research phase or to a development phase.
All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement.
Development expenditure is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.
As described on page 81, the Group considers that it is not possible to distinguish reliably between research and development activities until relatively late in the programme.
Expenditure capitalised is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the product.
The fair value of research and development recognised during a business combination relate to the acquired companys technology.
Amortisation occurs on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.
Recoverable engine costs The Group may sell OE to customers at a price below its cost, on the basis that this deficit will be recovered from the profits of highly probable future aftermarket sales.
As described on page 81, this sale is considered to give rise to an intangible asset, which, subject to an impairment review, is recognised at the time of delivery and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period that highly probable aftermarket sales are expected to be earned.
Customer relationships The fair value of customer relationships recognised during a business combination relate to the acquired companys established relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 87 1 Accounting policies continued Software The cost of acquiring software that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of five years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: i land and buildings, as advised by the Groups professional advisers: a freehold buildings five to 45 years average 24 years b leasehold buildings lower of advisers estimates or period of lease c no depreciation is provided on freehold land ii plant and equipment five to 25 years average 13 years iii aircraft and engines five to 20 years average 15 years.
Operating leases Payments made and rentals received under operating lease arrangements are charged credited to the income statement on a straightlinebasis.
Impairment of non-current assets Impairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually.
Other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually.
If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment test is performed to estimate the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised as an expense.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to sell, if this is readily available.
The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first-in, first-out basis.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less on inception.
The Group considers overdrafts repayable on demand to be an integral part of its cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Post-retirement benefits Pensions and similar benefits principally healthcare are accounted for under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Surpluses in schemes are recognised as assets only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future.
A liability is recognised to the extent that the minimum funding requirements in respect of past service will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus.
The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees: past service costs are recognised immediately: and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 88 Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Actuarial gains and losses and movements in unrecognised surpluses and minimum funding liabilities are recognised immediately in OCI.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees.
These are principally equity-settled arrangements and are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result of the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition in the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Cash-settled share options grants in the International ShareSave plan are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.
The cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share plans is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
See note 21 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.
Sales financing support In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers.
These arrangements fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees: and asset-value guarantees.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, credit-based guarantees are treated as insurance contracts.
The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be nonfinancial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts.
As described on page 82, the directors consider the likelihood of crystallisation is assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.
The Groups contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis.
Revisions to Adopted IFRS in 2013 With effect from 1 January 2013, the Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits issued by the IASB in June 2011.
A description of these amendments and their effect is set out in note 19.
In summary, the amendments require: recognition of certain administrative costs as operating costs rather than being included in net financing: net financing to be calculated on the net asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet using an AA corporate bond rate rather than using an expected rate of return for scheme assets: and immediate recognition of previously unrecognised past-service credits.
Had these amendments not been adopted, the results would have been affected as follows: profit before financing 15million higher 2012 22million higher : net post-retirement financing 107million higher 2012 56million higher : and net assets 73million lower 2012 100million lower.
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2013 Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
Under Adopted IFRS, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and amendments to IAS 17 Separate Financial Statements are effective for 2014.
The principal potential effect is that certain entities previously classified as joint ventures might be classified as joint operations, requiring the Groups share of the individual assets and liabilities of these entities to be included in the financial statements rather than the equity accounting method previously applied.
The Group has reviewed its material joint ventures and has concluded that none are to be classified as joint operations under the requirements of IFRS 11.
If endorsed, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 89 2 Segmental analysis The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8, as follows: Civil aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
Marine development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine-power propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
Energy development, manufacture, marketing and sales of power systems for the offshore oil and gas industry and electrical power generation and aftermarket services.
Power Systems development, manufacture, marketing and sales of diesel engines.
Engineering and technology and Operations, discussed in the strategic report, operate on a Group-wide basis across all the above segments.
The operating results reviewed by the Board are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board considers reflects better the economic substance of the Groups trading during the year.
The principles adopted to determine underlying results are: Underlying revenues Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts.
Underlying profit before financing Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, this reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts.
In addition, adjustments have been made to exclude one-off past-service costs and credits on post-retirement schemes and the effect of acquisition accounting.
Underlying profit before taxation In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing: includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts: and excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, changes in value of financial RRSA contracts arising from changes in forecast payments, changes in the value of put options on NCI and the net impact of financing costs related to post-retirement scheme benefits.
This analysis also includes a reconciliation of the underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.

These reductions were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
As the reduction to 20percent was substantively enacted prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate.
The resulting charges or credits have been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity.
Accordingly, in 2013, 59million has been credited to the income statement, 1million has been charged to the OCI and 9million has been charged directly to equity.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 573million 2012 144million.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that consent will not be given in the foreseeable future.
6 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share EPS are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held under trust, which have been treated as if they had beencancelled.
Diluted EPS are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the bonus element of share options.
2012 figures have been restated to reflect the adoption of amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits see note 19, and the change in the accounting policy for RRSAs see note 1.
The impact of the restatement on the previously reported EPS of 123.23p was an increase of 1.40p relating to the IAS 19 amendments and an increase of 0.75p relating to the change in the accounting policy for RRSAs.

Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Groups products product lives are often measured in decades, these forecast the next ten years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates 2.0 2.75percent that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions, the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
Impairment tests are performed using prevailing exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 13percent 2012 13percent, based on the Groups weighted average cost ofcapital, adjusted for specific risk where appropriate.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are: Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG Volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation.
These are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of capture of market share and long-term economic forecasts.
The principal foreign exchange exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into euros.
For the purposes of the impairment only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at twopercent.
Following the recognition of RRPS at fair value on 1 January 2013, reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions could cause the value of goodwill to fall below its carrying value, such as a reduction in the level of cash generation of ninepercent, a reduction in the assumed long-term growth rate to 0.8percent or an increase in the assumed discount rate of 0.7percent.
Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation.
These are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
The principal foreign exchange exposure is on translating US dollar income into euros.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5percent 2012 2.5percent.
The directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 85percent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Vinters Limited Volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation.
The principal foreign exchange exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into Norwegian kroner.
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 75percent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Other intangible assets Certification costs and participation fees, customer relationships, technology, patents and licences, order backlog, trademark, development costs and recoverable engine costs have been reviewed for impairment in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been performed on the following basis: The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes.
The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates, and foreign exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 11percent 2012 11percent, based on the Groups weighted average cost ofcapital.
No impairment is required on this basis.
However, a combination of changes in assumptions and adverse movements in variables that areoutside the Groups control discount rate, exchange rate and airframe delays, could result in impairment in future years.

Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A These primarily comprise unconsolidated companies where fair value approximates to the book value.
B Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
C Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
D Borrowings are carried at amortised cost.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13.
E The value of the put option on NCI is determined in accordance with the contractual terms, which requires averaging three valuations, covering forecasts of the business performance and external metrics of comparable business and transactions.
F The fair value of RRSAs is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
IFRS 13 defines a three-level valuation hierarchy: Level 1 quoted prices for similar instruments: Level 2 directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3 inputs not based on observable market data.

Where the effectiveness of a hedging relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the cash flow hedge reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item.
The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges.
The Group uses interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.

Exercise price of put option on non-controlling interests and financial RRSAs The Group has agreed a put option with Daimler AG, such that Daimler can sell its interest in Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH RRPSH to the Group.
The exercise price of this option is included as a financial liability.
The Group has financial liabilities arising from financial RRSAs.
These financial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the amortised cost method.
This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash flows of the arrangements using the internal rate of return at the inception of the arrangements as the discount rate.

Risk management policies and hedging activities The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: liquidity risk: credit risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash flows most significantly US dollars, followed by the euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Groups risk management activities.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with BBB or higher rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk, floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents cash flow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position.
These are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
Other price risk The Groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to three months.
The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 111 17 Financial instruments continued Some of the Groups borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary financial covenants.
If the Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the facilities.
There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Groups facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for a given movement in the Groups credit rating.
In addition, the Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available as follows: 2013 2012 m m Expiring in one to two years Expiring after two years 1,250 1,000 1,250 1,000 Sensitivity analysis 2013 2012 Sensitivities at 31 December all other variables held constant impact on profit after tax and equity m m Sterling 10% weaker against the US dollar 1,177 1,073 Sterling 10% stronger against the US dollar 963 878 Euro 10% weaker against the US dollar 128 146 Euro 10% stronger against the US dollar 100 118 Sterling 10% weaker against the Euro 95 Sterling 10% stronger against the Euro 78 Commodity prices 10% lower 16 20 Commodity prices 10% higher 16 20 At 31 December 2013 the Group had no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates on that date.
The main interest rate sensitivity for the Group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies on page 106.
C Shares and payments to shareholders The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares C Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
C Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash.
Any C Shares retained attract a dividend of 75percent of LIBOR on the 0.1 pence nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights.
The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than tenpercent of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
Movements in the C Shares during the year were as follows: 2013 2012 Nominal value Nominal value Millions m Millions m Issued and fully paid At 1 January 10,418 10 6,371 6 Issued 366,041 366 327,643 328 Redeemed 360,173 360 323,596 324 At 31 December 16,286 16 10,418 10 Payments to shareholders in respect of the year represent the value of C Shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.

Provisions for warranties and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and generally cover a period of up to three years.
Provisions for contract loss and restructuring are generally expected to be utilised within two years.
In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers generally in respect of civil aircraft.
The Groups commitments relating to these financing arrangements are spread over many years, relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing.
Customer financing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and or financing.
These guarantees, the risks arising and the process used to assess the extent of the risk are described under the heading Customer financing in the Chief Financial Officers review on page 13.
It is estimated that the provision will be utilised as follows: 2013 2012 m m Potential claims with specific claim dates: In one year or less 29 30 In more than one year but less than five years 38 43 In more than five years 5 8 Potential claims that may arise at any time up to the date of expiry of the guarantee: Up to one year 1 Up to five years 1 73 82 Commitments on delivered aircraft in excess of the amounts provided are shown in the table below.
These are reported on a discounted basis at the Groups borrowing rate to reflect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
These amounts do not represent values that are expected to crystallise.
The commitments are denominated in US dollars.
As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow hedge accounting for future foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
The estimated values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser.

There are also commitments in respect of undelivered aircraft, but it is not considered practicable to estimate these, as deliveries can be many years in the future, and the relevant financing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
The Groups captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group.
Significant delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 113 19 Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes: UK defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service: and overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice.
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
The valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, where relevant, updated by the scheme actuaries to 31 December 2013.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks.
In the UK, and in the principal US pension schemes, the Group has adopted an investment policy to mitigate some of these risks.
This involves investing a significant proportion of the scheme assets in liability driven investment LDI portfolios, which hold investments designed to offset interest rate and inflation rate risks.
In addition, in the UK, the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund has invested in a longevity swap, which is designed to offset longevity risks in respect of existing pensioners.
The Group has adopted amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits with effect from 1 January 2013.
The impact is described further below.

This is a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 37million 2012 36million in the year.

Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet.
2 A minimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements require future contributions in respect of past service that will result in a future unrecognisable surplus.

The Consumer Price Index is assumed to be onepercent lower.
Discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
The rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 115 19 Post-retirement benefits continued The inflation assumption is determined by the market implied assumption based on the yields on long-term indexed linked government securities and increases in salaries are based on actual experience, allowing for promotion, of the real increase above inflation.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAP actuarial tables, with future improvements inline with the CMI 2013 core projections and long-term improvements of 1.25percent.
Where appropriate, these are adjusted totake account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
Other assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation.
The rate of increase of pensions in payment is based on the rules of the relevant scheme, combined with the inflation assumption where the increase is capped.

2 Under the longevity swap, the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund RRPF has agreed an average life expectancy of pensioners with a counterparty.
If pensioners live longer than expected the counterparty will make payments to the RRPF to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners.
If the reverse applies the cost of paying pensioners will be reduced but the scheme will be required to make payments to the counterparty.
Following the adoption of the amendments to IAS 19 and the interaction with IFRS 13 from 2013 the longevity swap has been valued on an external fair market basis, rather than using the same assumptions as used for the valuation of the schemes liabilities.
As the surplus on the RRPF is restricted, this has had no impact on the net surplus deficit recognised in the balance sheet.
Had the longevity swap been valued on the same basis as 2012, its value would have been a liability of 156m, the movement since 2012 largely reflecting the changes in mortality and discount rate assumptions.
The valuation is based on an estimate of the assumptions that a hypothetical third party would use for the future mortality and premium.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The longevity swap is valued by the scheme actuaries based on the difference between the agreed longevity assumptions at inception and actual longevity experience.
All other fair values are provided by the fund managers.
Where available, the fair values are quoted prices eg listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds.
Unlisted investments private equity are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance.
Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yieldcurves.

In the UK, the funding is set on the basis of a triennial funding valuation by the actuaries for which the assumptions may differ from those above.
In particular, the discount rate used to value the obligations takes account of the investment strategy, rather than being based on market yields of AA corporate bonds.
As a result of these valuations, the Group and the scheme trustees agree a Schedule of Contributions SoC, which sets out the required contributions from the employer and employees for current service.
Where the scheme is in deficit, the SoC also includes required contributions from the employer to eliminate the deficit.
The most recent agreed triennial valuations for the principal schemes are: Obligations at 31 December 2013 Valuation m date Rolls-Royce Pension Fund 6,543 31 March 2012 Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme 1,540 5 April 2013 Vickers Group Pension Scheme 637 31 March 2013 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Other information Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 117 19 Post-retirement benefits continued Sensitivities The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions set out on page 114.
The following table summarises the estimated impact of a change in the assumption on the UK defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2013, while holding all other assumptions constant.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
For the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates, inflation on an economic basis and in the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund in the UK, the longevity of pensioners.
Where appropriate, the table also includes the corresponding movement in the value of the plan assets.

On an economic basis the correlation is approximately 97percent.

This has now been recognised in full at 1 January 2012.
As a consequence, the amortisation of this past-service credit in 2012 is eliminated.
In addition, an adjustment has been made in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation on one of the UK schemes to put it on a consistent basis with the other schemes.
B Previously all administrative costs were offset against the expected return on scheme assets.
The amendments only allow this in respect of the costs of managing scheme assets: other administrative expenses are now included in the current service cost.
C Previously net financing comprised the actual expected return on scheme assets based on the underlying assets and a financing charge on scheme liabilities calculated using a AA corporate bond rate.
The amendments require net financing to be calculated on the net asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet using an AA corporate bond rate.
This has a consequential impact on amounts recognised in OCI: i the change in assumed return on scheme assets affects the related actuarial gains or losses: and ii implicit financing on movements in the unrecognised surplus and the minimum funding liability is not included in the income statement.

This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.
ShareSave The fair value of the options granted under the ShareSave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA The fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 120 Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Contingent liabilities On 6 December 2012, the Company announced that it had passed information to the SFO relating to concerns in overseas markets.
Since that date the Company has continued its investigations and is engaging with the SFO and other authorities in the UK, the USA and elsewhere.
In December 2013, the Company announced that it had been informed by the SFO that it had commenced a formal investigation.
The consequence of these disclosures will be decided by the regulatory authorities.
It remains too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the Group.
Accordingly, the potential for fines, penalties or other consequences including debarment from government contracts, suspension of export privileges and reputational damage cannot currently be assessed.
As the investigation is ongoing, it is not yet possible to identify the timescale in which these issues might be resolved.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions andclaims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency ofan insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK-based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.
The Groups share of equity-accounted entities contingent liabilities is 13million 2012 48million.

On 1January 2013, conditions were fulfilled which gave the Group certain rights that result in RRPS being classified as a subsidiary and consolidated.
Accordingly, the Groups joint venture interest in Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH RRPSH has been reclassified as a subsidiary.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed are 1,339million, giving rise to goodwill of 773million, as set out in the table below.
Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG Daimler each hold 50percent of the shares of RRPSH, which itself held over 99percent of the shares of RRPS.
During 2013, RRPSH acquired the remaining 1percent of shares of RRPS.
RRPS is a premium supplier of engines, propulsion systems and components for marine, energy, defence, and other industrial applications often described as offhighway applications.
Other On 30 April 2013, the Group acquired 100percent of the issued share capital of Hyper-Therm High-Temperature Composites, Inc. a producer of state-of-the-art composite materials, including ceramic matrix composites, engineered coatings and thermal-structural components.
On 15 August 2013, the Group acquired 100percent of SmartMotor AS, a leading specialist in the development of permanent magnet technology.
On 24 December 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 49percent of shares not held in Composite Technology and Applications Limited, a business engaged in the development of composite fan blades and containment cases for the next generation of advanced turbofan engines.
For each of the other acquisitions noted, the acquisition cost net of cash and borrowings acquired has been allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities principally technology, patents and licences, customer relationships, trademark, order backlog and other intangible assets.

The previous joint venture investment holding in RRPSH of 1,328million was revalued, giving rise to a gain of 115million.
As part of the RRPSH shareholders agreement, Daimler AG has the option to sell its shares in RRPSH to Rolls-Royce for a period of six years from 1 January 2013.
The initial fair value of the exercise price of this option in respect of RRPS has been recognised as a liability 1,432million, which has been charged to NCI and retained earnings.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of RRPS amounting to 773million which is not tax deductible consists of anticipated synergies and the assembled workforce.
The anticipated synergies principally arise from: increases in revenue from the combination of the routes to market: and cost savings from the combination of the supply chain and central functions.
The gross contractual value of trade receivables acquired is 446million.
At the acquisition date, it was estimated that contractual cash flows of 24million would not be collected.
The acquisition of the controlling interest in RRPS contributed 2,593million of revenue and profit before tax of 10million including amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition to the Groups results for the year.
Disposals On 29 January 2013, Alstom acquired Tidal Generation Limited.
