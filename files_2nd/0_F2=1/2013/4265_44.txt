Financial report continued Investment Income and finance costs Investment income primarily represents the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and treasury deposits which was $320.7 million on average in 2012 2011 $361.8 million.
Investment income on these assets fell to $1.2 million 2011 $1.9 million due to a fall in market interest rates.
A breakdown of finance costs can be found in note 9 to the financial statements.
They increased by $2.4 million in 2012, primarily due to a one off cost from hedging the sterling cashflows arising from the tender offer in November 2012.
Taxation The tax charge for 2012 was $50.7 million, compared to a credit of $85.3 million in 2011.
This resulted in an effective tax rate of 49.8% for the year 2011 166%.
The 2012 tax charge primarily arose due to the Samsung Transaction see page 22 for details.
Excluding this event, the effective tax rate was 22.6%.
The underlying effective tax rate was 23.6% in 2012, which differed from the average uK statutory rate of 24.5% due to the impact of R&D tax credits offset by higher rates of tax on our uS profits.
The tax credit for 2011 mainly resulted from the recognition of deferred tax assets on losses and other temporary differences which were recognised following a review of the Groups future activities and profitability.
The underlying effective tax rate in 2011 was 24.5% and differed from the uK statutory rate for the same reasons as in 2012.
Profit for the period We recorded a profit for the 2012 period of $51.2 million, compared to $33.9 million in 2011.
This increase was mainly due to the following items all of which are separately explained in the analysis above: 2012 improved trading performance revenue and gross margin : a one off profit from the Samsung Transaction of $127.2 million less a resulting tax charge of $56.3 million: a one off tax credit in 2011 due to recognition of deferred tax assets: and changes in R&D and SG&A expenses.
Earnings per Share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share were $0.26 and $0.25 respectively in 2012, compared to $0.19 for both basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share in 2011. underlying diluted earnings per ordinary share were $0.27 in 2012 and $0.20 in 2011.
The major factor leading to this increase was the change in profit for the period as described above and the reduction in the volume of ordinary shares following the tender offer and share buybacks in 2012.
