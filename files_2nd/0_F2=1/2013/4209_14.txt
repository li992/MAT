How We Performed 2013 has been another year characterised by strong financial performance, with good growth in pre-tax profits and earnings per share, a reduced pension deficit and lower borrowings: all achieved in the context of a demanding marketplace that looks set to continue.
After concerted efforts last year to expand our resources, we now have the people and facilities we need to support our growth plans and expect to see steady improvements in sales growth in the future.
Improved Sales and Business Mix Continuing sales increased by 2.4% in 2013 compared to the year before, with a decline in underlying sales of 0.2% masked by favourable currency translation and acquisitions.
Our overall mix of business improved, with a 10.8% increase in New and Protected Product NPP sales.
We also experienced slightly stronger sales progress in the second half of the year than the first.
Increased Profitability Overall Adjusted operating profit grew 3.7% to 264.6m 2012: 255.1m with return on sales reaching 24.6% 2012: 24.3%.
We saw profit growth in both our Consumer Care and Performance Technologies business segments, achieving our highest ever return on sales figures in each sector.
Compared to 2012, Industrial Chemicals profits were flat.
Sean Christie, Group Finance Director The reduced pension deficit led to a lower funding cost and borrowings reduced slightly.
As a result net interest costs were 3.4m lower than in 2012.
The result of this increase in operating profit and reduction in financing costs has been an increase in adjusted pre-tax profit of 5.4% to 251.4m 2012: 238.5m.
Total pre-tax profit, including acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired intangible assets, grew by 5.0% to 250.1m 2012: 238.3m.
Earnings Per Share and Dividend Performance Falling corporation tax rates in the UK and a more favourable mix of overseas earnings further reduced our tax rate to 28.7% 2012: 31.1%.
Consequently, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew a little more than profits, up 8.3% to 132.2p.
On an unadjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 7.6% to 131.2p.
Dividends were increased in line with earnings growth.
Accounting for Acquisitions The acquisitions of Sipo and Arizonas Specialty Chemicals business increased acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
If the right targets can be found, these costs are likely to increase in the future.
To avoid distorting the underlying trend in profitability we have chosen to introduce the definitions Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted pre-tax profit and Adjusted earnings per share.
In each case we exclude acquisition costs, amortisation or write off of intangible assets arising on acquisition and exceptional items.
The Group Income Statement has been produced in a columnar format to further aid this analysis.
Goodwill This years acquisitions have increased the carrying amount of goodwill in P97 Note 8 - Earnings Per Share the Group balance sheet to 229.3m 2012: 206.5m.
The goodwill relates predominantly to the value in the commercial and other synergies P99 Note 12 - Retirement Benefits arising from the combination of the acquired technologies and products with Crodas established global sales, marketing and R&D networks.
P108 Note 20 - Borrowings Debt and Liquidity Free cash flow was up 38.0% at 249.0m 2012: 180.5m helped by tight P120 Note 28 - Acquisitions control of working capital.

Capital expenditure was 46.6m 2012: 52.7m, the cash effect of our targeted mergers and acquisitions was 54.9m, including inherited borrowings, and dividend pay-outs totalled 83.6m.
Our main banking facilities run to May 2015, however we plan to refinance these loans during 2014.
Capital Expenditure Capital expenditure was 1.3 times depreciation at 46.6m 2012: 52.7m, with the biggest spends resulting from enhancing our manufacturing capability in North America and Singapore.
The amount of expenditure was lower than originally planned for 2013.
This was due in part to project phasing, but also because of our response to the lower than expected market demand we encountered in 2012 and 2013.
We do expect to spend significantly more on capital expenditure in 2014, as the phasing benefits seen in 2013 reverse and we commence work on a number of major new capital projects.
