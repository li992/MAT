This also means we have eliminated an waste we send to landfill by estimated 80,000 tonnes of GHG emissions, and better ways to reduce, reuse, nearly 80% equivalent to 11% of Diageos total emissions and recycle.
Overall, 25 operational sites have achieved Our approach zero waste to landfill already, including our first As with most products, making alcoholic site in Africa, the Achimota brewery in Ghana, beverages generates waste at almost every where we make Guinness and other beer stage of the product lifecycle.
Where possible, brands, while 50 sites send less than one tonne we aim to reuse or recycle the waste from of waste to landfill.
Eliminating waste to landfill our operations in ways that bring benefits entirely by 2015 remains a challenging target, to our business, the environment, and but we are making good progress.
Above all, were committed to eliminating Reducing materials waste to landfill from our operations by 2015.
We can reduce the amount of waste going to Landfill sites can cause the contamination landfill by reducing the volume of materials of ground water, emit the greenhouse gas weuse in the first place.
