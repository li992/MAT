We were very pleased to maintain a long-standing relationship with a strong business that had been looking for a new London headquarters 45 for some time.
To facilitate the deal, Publicis Groupe subsidiary Saatchi & Saatchi extended its lease on a short-term basis at 80 Charlotte Street W1 to tie in with the delivery of its new buildings.
Rents of 55 per sq ft at Turnmill and 65 per sq ft at Chancery Lane were achieved on the new space, 16% and 7% 30 respectively above the December 2012 ERVs.
The transaction underpins the increasing attractions of Clerkenwell Holborn and our development programme to media businesses.
15 Another clear example of this trend was the multi-letting of The Buckley Building, also in Clerkenwell.
This building was 25% pre-let on completion in April 2013, and fully let within six months to a further four tenants.
We agreed rents of over 30% in excess of our original estimates with the final letting achieving 0 0-5 5-10 10-15 15-20 Over 20 years years years years years 57.50 per sq ft.
Elsewhere, we established new rental levels at Charlotte Building 65 per sq ft and Tower House 70 per No lease breaks exercised sq ft, and we were pleased to let 132-142 Hampstead Road Lease breaks exercised at first opportunity quickly, which, as discussed last year, has been blighted by 1 Based upon annualised net contracted rental income of 126.0m the uncertainty surrounding HS2.
Separately, at the end of 2013 and coincident with a rent review, we extended our tenants long leasehold interest on 1 the Grafton Hotel, 130 Tottenham Court Road W1 from 77 to Average unexpired lease length Years 150 years.
This has seen our income rise 56% to 0.9m pa. 9 The new rent will increase by 3% pa, compounded every five years, and is subject to an open market rent review in 2033, 8 at which time the tenant will also have an option to break.
The lease restructure led to a valuation increase of 22% in 2013.
