Movements increased 2% for the year as a whole, with year on year growth recorded for 9 of the 12 months.

Deliveries are forecast to continue to increase from 2014 due to existing order books, the introduction of new jet models entering service and the need to refresh the fleet as it ages.
Long-term forecasts project the delivery of more than 9,000 new business jets between 2013 and 2022, with the North America market positioned to take the majority of new deliveries over the next five years.

By contrast, some of the older business jets 30 years of age are increasingly under pressure from regulatory mandates and market economics to be permanently removed from the market.
Turboprop business aircraft have seen their inventory for sale return to more historically normal levels.
During 2013, pricing for both segments remained broadly stable.
Despite the market having not recovered as quickly as we would have hoped from its decline during the 2007-2009 recession, the fleet has continued to grow throughout.
indb 24 12 03 2014 12:10 500 Strategic Report Over the longer-term, the key drivers for B&GA are: continued GDP growth: total wealth Our Markets in 2013 and the increasing value of peoples time: corporate investment and growing corporate confidence.
The unusual nature of the 2007-2009 credit driven crisis and the slow associated recovery has meant that business reinvestment and confidence remains low despite corporate profits improving.
However, we have begun to see modest improvements in these measures throughout 2013, supporting the first signs of a pick-up in B&GA movements in North America.
Commercial Aviation Worldwide commercial aircraft movements declined by 1% in 2013 versus 2012, reflecting the airlines continued capacity management.
In North America and Europe, our highest penetration markets, commercial aircraft movements declined by 1% and 2% respectively as airline operators replaced older, smaller, less efficient jets with newer, larger, more efficient models.
Airline load factors reached historic highs during the year.
As economies in the West recover, we anticipate that increased demand will help to increase the number of aircraft movements in our key markets.

Whilst military budget cuts can negatively impact the flight activity of some military platforms and the associated maintenance spend, they can also have positive implications for the life extension of existing platforms as funding is directed away from new weapons development towards maintaining current platforms.
Our aftermarket businesses are flexible and well positioned to support maintenance, overhaul and support for the older, out of warranty aircraft now in service.
