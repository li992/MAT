Volatility arising in insurance businesses The Groups statutory result before tax is affected by insurance volatility caused by movements in financial markets, and policyholder interests volatility, which primarily reflects the gross up of policyholder tax included in the Group tax charge.
In 2013 the Groups statutory result before tax included positive insurance and policyholder interests volatility totalling 668 million compared to positive volatility of 312 million in 2012.
Volatility comprises the following: 2013 2012 m m Insurance volatility 218 189 1 Policyholder interests volatility 564 143 Total volatility 782 332 Insurance hedging arrangements 114 20 Total 668 312 1 Includes volatility relating to the Groups interest in St. Jamess Place.
Insurance volatility The Groups Insurance business has policyholder liabilities that are supported by substantial holdings of investments, including equities, property and fixed interest investments, all of which are subject to variations in their value.
The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments, yet IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments be reflected within the income statement.
As these investments are substantial and movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group, management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the divisions results on the basis of an expected return in addition to results based on the actual return.

expected investment returns in 2013 include appropriate returns for these assets.
The 2013 rates also reflect the move to swap rates as the basis for calculations.
The impact on the results due to the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return based upon economic assumptions made at the beginning of the year, adjusted for significant changes in asset mix is included within insurance volatility.
Changes in market variables also affect the realistic valuation of the guarantees and options embedded within the with-profits funds, the value of the in-force business and the value of shareholders funds.
The positive insurance volatility during 2013 in the Insurance division was 218 million, primarily reflecting the favourable performance of equity investments in the period relative to the expected return.
This has been partially offset by an increase in the long-term level of market implied inflation and lower cash returns compared to long-term expectations.
Policyholder interests volatility The application of accounting standards results in the introduction of other sources of significant volatility into the pre-tax profits of the life, pensions and investments business.
In order to provide a clearer representation of the performance of the business, and consistent with the way in which it is managed, adjustments are made to remove this volatility from underlying profits.
The effect of these adjustments is separately disclosed as policyholder interests volatility.
The most significant of these additional sources of volatility is policyholder tax.
Accounting standards require that tax on policyholder investment returns should be included in the Groups tax charge rather than being offset against the related income.
The result is, therefore, to either increase or decrease profit before tax with a related change in the tax charge.
Timing and measurement differences exist between provisions for tax and charges made to policyholders.
Consistent with the normalised approach taken in respect of insurance volatility, differences in the expected levels of the policyholder tax provision and policyholder charges are adjusted through policyholder interests volatility.
In 2013, the statutory results before tax included a credit to other income which relates to policyholder interests volatility totalling 564 million 2012: 143 million relating to the rise in equity markets in the period.
Insurance hedging arrangements To protect against deterioration in equity market conditions and the consequent negative impact on the value of in-force business on the Group balance sheet, the Group purchased put option contracts in 2012 financed by selling some upside potential from equity market movements.
These expired in 2013 and the charge booked in 2013 on these contracts was 9 million.
new protection was acquired in 2013 to replace the expired contracts.
On a mark-to-market valuation basis a loss of 105 million was recognised in relation to the new contracts in 2013.
