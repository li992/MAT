This means that profi ts earned are, to a large extent, not recognised immediately, but rather spread over a number of subsequent years.
A large proportion of car insurance claims costs relate to bigger bodily injury claims whose fi final cost can be impossible topredict accurately in the year they occur so delaying recognition until there is a high degree of certainty makes sense.
Thisis particularly appropriate for a company like Admiral which pays out the majority of profi ts as dividends.
This policy means that attractive profi ts earned in cyclically profi table times are only fully refl ected in subsequent years typically during cyclically less profi table times.
This conservative policy means that reserve releases have been a long term feature of Admirals results.
