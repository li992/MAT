Chairmans Statement BLUECREST BlueCrest continue to invest very heavily in their business and the Company believes it is a beneficiary of the consequent increased capability.
BlueCrest now employs over 600 people in 9 trading locations in 7 jurisdictions.
Most recently BlueCrest has opened offices in Sao Paulo, for LatAm trading, and in Toronto, for Canadian rates trading.
Personnel are split fairly evenly between portfolio management staff and support staff.
The robustness of the risk management function, in particular, has been evident during 2013 when risk has been maintained at a low and stable level while market volatility, particularly in fixed income and emerging markets, has been elevated.
Whilst the Board remains in regular communication with BlueCrest, it makes a point of visiting BlueCrest offices from time to time, the last such visit being in March 2014.
On these occasions we have always been impressed with the professionalism of BlueCrest but, as time has evolved since the Company launched in 2006, it has been very apparent that BlueCrest has developed into a truly institutional style business.
We believe that this is a very positive change for you as Shareholders.
It clearly differentiates BlueCrest and the Company from many hedge funds.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT Turning to the events of 2013, BlueCrest provides a detailed analysis in their report later in these financial statements but, in summary, it was central bank policy that, once again, drove the major movements in financial markets.
During the year the major moves were driven primarily by the subsidence of worries over the future of the Eurozone, combined with escalating concern over the tapering of stimulus by the US Federal Reserve.
The net result was that while developed market equities prospered, fixed income, emerging markets and commodities fell.
For AllBlue, four of the six strategies rose in 2013 with falls confined to BlueCrest Capital International fixed income relative value & macro and BlueTrend systematic trend following.
Both of these two funds recorded their first ever negative year.
The former suffered from difficulties in generating sustained returns as bonds yields rose.
BlueTrend struggled with the swift reversals of fortune in markets but most particularly from the end of the 30 year bull market in bonds.
In contrast, the other four funds generated impressive performance, particularly BlueMatrix systematic equity market neutral and BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit.
