There were no additional mining tax charges, to US$503 GE oz, despite a moderate decrease in total gold equivalent production.
Cost performance was supported by grade profile of the primary ore processed during the period and the higher share of gold produced at the CIP plant including penalties and accrued interest recognised in 2013, and there were no material changes to the provisions previously recognised.
The decrease in exploration expenses from US$33 million in 2012 to US$24 million in 2013 is mainly due to a lower versus heap leaching, as well as by robust operating performance of the mine.

Khakanjas TCC was US$756 GE oz, a 23% increase year-on-year.
This cost increase was driven by a scheduled decline in average grade processed from 9.4 g t to 8.1 GE g t year-on-year, and a higher share of relatively high-cost ore from Total cash costs by mine Avlayakan processed during the second half of the year.

The impairment mainly relates to the value of Avlayakan mining assets, which were acquired in 2009 for stock then valued at US$60 million with a view to establishing resources sufficient for a standalone mine.
Total 598 932 -36% Currently the asset operates as a satellite mine to Khakanja, which generates a significant amount of trucking and shipping 1 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA a non-IFRS measure as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses, write-down of inventory to net realisable costs which are offsetting at the prices used the high reserve grade of the deposit.

enable an increase in grade profile and improve cost levels accordingly.
An impairment of US$99 million was incurred in respect of Varvara, mainly represented by goodwill write-off.
Due to the Adjusted EBITDA margin relatively low grade ore, Varvara operations are more sensitive to gold and copper prices.
The impairment model does not % include any purchased third-party ore due to the short-term nature of the purchase arrangements, which represented about 2012 2013 20% of gold equivalent production at Varvara in 2012 and 16% in 2013, and was an important contribution to the economics 68 of the asset by leveraging existing processing capacity.
Goodwill on the original purchase transaction arose mainly due to this 61 59 56 additional contribution, which was assessed when estimating the purchase consideration paid.

The impairment model assumes that Polymetal will not proceed with the Sopka heap leach at the prices used, due to a lower than required return on the capital that needs to be invested in the start of the facility, and therefore assigns zero value to the low-grade ore stockpiles accumulated for heap leaching.
However, the construction of the heap leach at Birkachan 0 is already completed and leaching is planned from 2014.
At the assumed prices of US$1,200 oz for gold and US$18 oz for silver this would result in positive cash flow contribution, making processing of these stockpiles economic.
-9 At Mayskoye, an US$16 million write-down of inventories is represented by relatively low-grade and high-cost concentrate Dukat Voro Khakanja Varvara Omolon Albazino Mayskoye Total Amursk produced during the first months of the concentrator operation, with higher costs inherently associated with the ramp-up of the processing facility.
The source of impairment is expected to be non-recurring as Mayskoye had achieved design throughput and recovery by the end of 2013.
In 2013, Adjusted EBITDA was US$598 million, 36% lower year-on-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%.

The Albazino Amursk hub increased the Adjusted EBITDA almost threefold year-on-year due to significant production and sales growth, and Adjusted EBITDA at other segments declined year-on-year Polymetal has also written off its investment in its associate Ural-Polymetal totalling US$12 million, having assessed on the back of price-driven revenue decrease.

Annual Report 2013 Polymetal International plc Strategic report 66 67 Strategic report Financial review continued Other income statement items Capital expenditure Polymetal recorded a net foreign exchange loss in 2013 of US$74 million compared to a gain of US$7 million in 2012.

The loss resulted mainly from non-cash impairment charges pre-tax amount of US$366 million, equal to after-tax amount of US$315 million, unrealised foreign exchange losses in 2013 versus smaller absolute gains in 2012, and the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA.
