Remuneration Report Outside of the most senior tiers of Executives, the PSP is not operated as this arrangement is reserved for those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence Group level performance.
However, the Committee believes in wider employee share ownership and promotes this through the operation of the HMRC tax approved all-employee share schemes which are open to all UK employees.
Other similar share schemes are offered in other jurisdictions where local securities laws allow.
How the views of employees are taken into account The Company, in line with current market practice, does not actively consult with employees on Executive remuneration.
The Group has a diverse workforce operating globally in 34 different countries, with various local pay practices, which hinders effective consultation and so the Group Vice President, Human Resources updates the Committee periodically on feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group.
The Committee takes due account of remuneration structures elsewhere in the Group when setting pay for the Executive Directors for example, consideration is given to the overall salary increase budget and the incentive structures that operate across the Group.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings held with shareholders from time to time, is then considered as part of the Committees ongoing review of remuneration policy.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors The Groups policy results in a significant proportion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Group performance.
The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors varies under three different performance scenarios: below target, on-target and maximum.
When reviewing the graph, it should be noted that it has been prepared based on the policy detailed above and ignores, for simplicity, the potential impact of future share price growth.

The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits as disclosed on page 65 for the year ending 31 December 2013.
The pension value is based on the assumptions used to value pensions for the emoluments table as disclosed on page 65.
The Executive Directors can participate in the all-employee share plans on the same basis as other employees.
The value that may be received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits.
For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the graph above.
