Richard Davey Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 59 Governance Remuneration Committee Policy report This part of the Directors remuneration report sets out the remuneration policy for the company with effect from 1 April 2013.
Setting the remuneration policy Each year, the Committee reviews the remuneration policy for executive directors and other senior executive managers, taking into account both the external market and the companys strategic objectives over the short and the medium term.
Furthermore, there is a clear link between all-employee remuneration policies and those operated at a senior executive level.
The Committee addresses the need to balance risk and reward.
The Committee continues to monitor the variable pay arrangements for the executive directors and other members of the Executive Committee to take account of the risk prole of the company ensuring sustainability and how this is reected in variable remuneration.
The Committee believes that the schemes are appropriately managed and that the choice of performance measures and targets does not encourage undue risk taking by the executives.
The schemes incorporate a range of internal and external performance metrics, measuring both operational and financial performance providing a rounded assessment of overall company performance.
Linkage to all employee pay The Committee addresses the need to ensure that changes in senior executive remuneration are kept in line with workforce pay.
Whilst it has not set a specic policy on the relationship between executive directors pay and that of the rest of the workforce, it aims to ensure that executive salary movement is appropriately aligned to the rest of the workforce and specifically considers this carefully as part of its decision making process.
Furthermore, bonus schemes operate on a consistent basis throughout Severn Trent using the same balanced scorecard and all UK employees may participate in the Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan.
Shareholder views The Committee engages proactively with the companys major shareholders, and takes seriously their views.
Whenany material changes are made to the remuneration policy, the Committee Chairman will inform, and where appropriate, meet major shareholders in advance.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors The remuneration policy for executive directors comprises the following elements: F base salary: F annual bonus scheme: F long term incentive schemes: and F pension and benets.
The following table sets out a summary of each element of the executive directors remuneration packages.
Tony Ballance Martin Kane Andy Smith Tony Wray Michael McKeon Director, Strategy CEO Severn Director of Component Chief Executive Finance Director and Regulation Trent Services WaterServices Base salary from 575,000 466,800 211,300 256,900 274,600 1July 2013 On target annual 60% 60% 60% 60% 60% bonus % of salary Maximum annual 120% 120% 120% 120% 120% bonus % of salary % of bonus earned 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% deferred into shares Annual LTIP award 70% 50% 50% 50% 50% % of salary SMP award 0.5: 1 0.5: 1 0.5: 1 0.5: 1 0.5: 1 maximum ratio of matching shares to deferred shares Pension Cash supplement of Cash supplement of Dened contribution Cash supplement of Final salary dened arrangement 40% of base salary 40% of base salary scheme, 30% of base salary benefit scheme contributions of with cash 30% of base salary supplement of 40% of base salary above the salary cap Benets A car allowance of 15,000 per annum, family level private medical insurance, life assurance worth 6 x basesalary and an incapacity benets scheme 60 Governance Remuneration Committee Base salary Base salaries for individual directors are reviewed annually by the Committee and take effect from 1 July.
Salaries are set with reference to individual performance, experience and contribution, together with developments in the relevant employment market having regard to the market median for similar roles in publicly quoted companies of a comparable size and practice in other water companies and internal relativities.
The Committee gives due consideration to the current economic climate, current market practice and affordability regarding executive salary reviews and the broader employee salary review policy at the company.
The Committee has reviewed salaries for 2013 2014 and has determined that the base salaries for all executive directors will be increased by 2.5% from 1 July 2013.
This level of increase is in line with the average increase across the rest of the company.
Annual Bonus Scheme Executive directors are eligible for annual bonuses to encourage improved performance, with targets established by the Committee to align directors interests with shareholders interests.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for all executive directors is 120% of salary.
For the achievement of target performance which requires satisfaction of challenging goals, 60% of salary could be earned.
Allannual bonus payments are non-pensionable.
Executive directors bonuses are determined by performance against a balanced scorecard of measures with their individual contribution assessed through personal objectives.
Half of any bonus paid is deferred into shares and held for three years following payment.
If the executive is summarily dismissed without notice under his her employment contract then the deferred bonuses are forfeited.
In all other cases of cessation of employment the deferred bonuses are not lost and the shares are automatically released on the dealing day after the cessation ofemployment.
Severn Trent continues to operate a clawback provision.
Details of the bonus outturn for 2012 13 are shown in the Implementation report on pages 64 and 65.
Long term incentives The executive directors are eligible to participate in two long term incentive schemes: a LTIP: and b aShareMatching Plan SMP : a LTIP The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM.
Under the LTIP, annual conditional awards of performance shares maybe made to executive directors and senior staff, up to an annual maximum of 125% of base salary.
The policy level of LTIP awards is 70% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of base salary for other directors.
RoRCV will remain as the performance metric for the 2013 LTIP.
This measure is consistent with the measure used by Ofwat in setting customer prices as part of the Final Determination the process whereby Ofwat sets the level of prices we can charge customers and reects the efficiency of earnings rather than simply being an absolute measure of profit and is veried and published as part of the Annual Regulatory Performance Report.
The Committee believes that the use of RoRCV provides a strong alignment between the long term financial and operational performance of the group and the reward delivered to management.
Further information with regards to the performance of the 2009 and 2010 LTIP can be found in the Implementation report on page 67, together with the vestingschedule.
b SMP Under the SMP, executive directors can receive up to one matching share for each share deferred under the annual bonus plan.
The current policy is that they receive 0.5 matching share for each share deferred.
Awards will normally vest as soon as the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met provided that the participant remains in employment at the end of the three year period.
Awards under the SMP are subject to a relative TSR measure over three distinct performance periods.
However, awards will not normally vest to participants until the third anniversary of grant.
The performance condition requires the companys TSR is measured relative to those companies ranked 51-150 in the FTSE Index by market capitalisation excluding investment trusts.
This is considered to be the most suitable comparator group since the number of comparable regulated companies against which to compare the companys performance remains too small to enable a meaningful analysis.
TheFTSE 51-150 comparator group allows for the company performance to be measured against a broader market without any one sector overly impacting the group.
In addition for awards to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that theTSR is reective of the companys underlying performance.
At the time of release participants will receive the value of the dividends paid on vested shares over the performance period.
TheTSR vesting schedule and detail of shares vested during the period reported are shown in the Implementation report.
Theplan was introduced in 2010 with therst awards due to vest this year.

Details of variable pay earned in the year Annual bonus plan outturn 2012 13 In the 2012 13 financial year, the Chief Executive and Finance Director had: i 80% of their bonus outturn based on the performance of Severn Trent Water, ii 10% based on the performance of Severn Trent Services and iii 10% based on personal contribution.
The remaining executive directors with the exception of the Chief Executive officer, Severn Trent Services, had 90% of their bonus outturn attributed to the performance of Severn Trent Water and 10% based on personal performance.
The Chief Executive officer, Severn Trent Services had 70% of his bonus linked to the performance of Severn Trent Services, 10% linked to the performance of Severn Trent Water and 20% against personal contribution.
i Severn Trent Water The bonus outturn in respect of Severn Trent Water performance was operated by reference to a balanced scorecard of measures, based on 10 of the companys 16 KPIs shown on page 139.
The Committee believes that the use of the selected 10 Severn Trent Water KPIs continues to be both an effective and challenging annual bonus metric and meets the needs of the business.
The bonus entitlement was determined by reference to the aggregate number of points awarded across all the KPIs.
The targets taken together are considered by the board to have an impact on the longer term financial performance of the company and a number ofthem are reported to Ofwat.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 65 Governance Remuneration Committee A denition of each KPI is listed below: Key area Objective Key Performance Indicators Employee Provide a safe working environment KPI 1 Lost time incidents per 100,000 hrs worked Develop a confident and productive workforce KPI 2 Employee motivation Customer Quality interaction with the customer KPI 4 Service Incentive Mechanism Qualitative KPI 5 Service Incentive Mechanism Quantitative KPI 7 Serviceability Waste KPI 8 Serviceability Water Financial Asset base enhancement KPI 9 Capital Expenditure net versus Final Determination % outperformance Management of cost base KPI 11 Operating Expenditure versus Final Determination % outperformance Environment Minimise environmental impact KPI 12 Pollution incidents cat 1, 2 and 3 KPI 16 Leakage Ml d Post MLE Each KPI has 100 target points, 130 stretch points and are uncapped.
For executive directors to be awarded the maximum bonus available they are required to achieve 1,300 aggregate points.
During the year 7 of the 10 KPIs exceeded the stretch level of performance.
After examining the overall performance and indicative bonus outturn the Committee determined that each of the 7KPIs should be capped at the level of stretch performance.
As a consequence the bonus awarded for the Severn Trent Water portion of the annual bonus was 77.7% of its bonus element maximum, representing a strong performance in the year and continues the positive progressive trend in the outturn of the KPIs.
The chart below shows the points awarded by the Committee forbonus purposes under each of the 10 KPIs in relation to the 2012 13 annual bonus scheme and the effect of capping of each KPIat stretch performance.
Severn Trent Water bonus points 2012 2013 1,166 Points 450 400 400 350 300 250 200 176 163 160 160 154 146 150 133 Stretch points 126 100 Target Points 50 0 0 KPI1 KPI2 KPI4 KPI5 KPI7 KPI8 KPI9 KPI11 KPI12 KPI16 Employee Customer Financial Environment Capital expenditure Capex is measured annually and over the five year AMP period.
The directors are incentivised to outperform the annual Capex target: however, this year the annual target was not outperformed and therefore zero points were achieved.
Severn Trent Water remains on track to meet its five year Capex target at the end of the AMP.
ii Severn Trent Services A proportion of the bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive 10%, Finance Director 10% and Chief Executive of Severn Trent Services 70% was measured against the performance of Severn Trent Services.
Performance was measured against the profit before interest and tax PBIT before exceptional items and the return on invested capital ROIC of Severn Trent Services.
Anumber of the personal objectives set for the directors named above also relate to the performance of Severn Trent Services.
Following a strong year of performance, the PBIT and ROIC targets were met in full and the bonus award for this element of the planwill pay out at themaximum.
iii Personal contribution All directors had 10% of their bonus opportunity measured against personal objectives, with the exception of the Chief Executive ofSevern Trent Services who had 20%.
Performance against personal objectives in the year was strong with directors receiving between 90% and 96% of the maximum bonus opportunity available under this element of the annual bonus plan.
The Committee has reviewed the operation of the annual bonus plan over the year and concluded that it should operate on a similar basis for 2013 2014.
66 Governance Remuneration Committee Directors pension provisions Tony Wray and Michael McKeon receive a salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future pension provision and MartinKane receives 30% of salary.

The transfer value basis has been updated since the last year end.
Transfer values quoted above reflect the transfer value basis that was in force at the time of the accrued pension calculation.
The impact of the change in methodology was to increase the transfer value at 31 March 2013 value as follows: Andy Smith 23,400, Tony Wray 17,100, Martin Kane 89,300.
Mr Wray ceased to contribute to the scheme from 31 December 2011.
At this date he became a deferred pensioner of the scheme and stopped accruing pensionable service.
Towers Watson have calculated his accrued pension and Final Pensionable Salary as at 31 December 2011.
In addition, Towers Watson have calculated his transfer value as at 31March 2013 allowing for deferred revaluation to this date.
Ination gure used in respect of year is February 2013 3.2% as the latest available gure prior to the year end.

Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 67 Governance Remuneration Committee ii Long Term Incentive Plan 17 The executive directors have further interests in the companys ordinary shares of 97 p each by virtue of having received 19 contingent awards of shares under the LTIP.
The LTIP operates on a three year rolling basis.
Awards do not vest until they have been held in trust for three years and specic performance criteria have been satisfied.
The Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust is operated in conjunction with the LTIP.
Executive directors have a technical interest in 395,749 shares held by the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust.
The LTIP awards made in 2009 and 2010 were subject to TSR performance, measured relative to those companies ranked 51150 in the FTSE by market capitalisation excluding investment trusts.
At median performance, 25% of awards vest and 100% vest for performance at or above the upper quartile.
In addition, for awards to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the companys TSR is reective of the companys underlying performance.
The 2009 award ended its TSR performance period on 31 March 2012 and vested at 28.4%.
The market price on the date of vesting 1 June 2012 of the 2009 award was 17.60.
The 2010 award ended its TSR performance period on 31 March 2013 and will vest at 57.5%.
The performance conditions for the LTIP awards made in 2011 and 2012 are based on Return on Regulatory Capital Value RoRCV.
Asliding scale of targets is used, linked to outperformance of the Ofwat Final Determination shown graphically below: RoRCV vesting schedule for 2011, 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards Percentage of award vesting % 100 75 50 25 0 99% 100% 101% 102% 103% 104% 105% 106% 107% 108% Average annual RoRCV against the Ofwat Final Determination expectation 68 Governance Remuneration Committee This vesting schedule is set so as to ensure that executives are appropriately rewarded for performance in excess of the Final Determination, with no payouts for performance below this.
However, it is also important that executives are not over incentivised toachieve excessive levels of RoRCV, which could in theory incentivise inappropriate behaviours such  which does not deliver customer value or inadequate investment in our capital base.
TheCommitteebelieves the above scale encourages delivery of strong performance against the Final Determination,  the companys wider values.
Performance is measured over three financial years.
If the vesting result is 0% or greater than 50% then the Committee reserves thediscretionary power to change this result.
If it is greater than 50% it may reduce the vesting to a number not less than 50% as it considers appropriate: and if it is 0% it may increase it to any gure not greater than 50%.
The use of this discretion is expected to be exceptional, but may be invoked by the Committee in order to take into account of any of the following factors not an exhaustive list : F actual RPI compared to the Ofwat assumed RPI gure even though the RoRCV is adjusted each year for RPI a significant swing in ination during the year can result in substantial under or over performance on the RoRCV target.
RPI in itself is not a factor that management can influence: F changes to the nancing of the company as approved by the board during the performance period for example a significant change to the level of gearing of the balance sheet would result in partially meeting this performance condition: and F policy changes that occur during the performance period there is much discussion on the future shape of the water industry inthe UK and if enacted we would wish to ensure that any changes have a neutral impact on existing awards.
Participants are entitled to additional shares in lieu of dividends paid on vested shares over the performance period.
iii Annual Bonus Scheme The shares in respect to 2012 2013 performance year are due to be granted in June 2013.
The table below shows outstanding unreleased share awards from previous years.
The market price on the date of grant of the 2012 award was 16.45 28 June 2012.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 69 Governance Remuneration Committee iv Share Matching Plan Under the Share Matching Plan executives can receive, subject to performance, matching shares for each share deferred under the annual bonus plan.
The current policy is for one matching share to be awarded for every two deferred shares.
The table below shows outstanding unreleased matching shares.
Shown graphically, the vesting schedule and performance and vesting periods apply to the 2010, 2011 and 2012 SMP awards is: TSR vesting schedule Performance and vesting period Percentage of award vesting % Performance period months 100 50% of award 0-18 Months 75 30% of award 0-27 Months 50 25 20% of award 0-36 Months 0 0 9 18 27 36 Median Upper Position against FTSE 51-150 excluding investment trusts TSR performance measured Holding period In addition, for any awards to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the vesting level is justied when taking into account theunderlying financial performance of the company over the full three year performance period and that there has been no compromise to the commercial practices or optional standards of the group over this period.
The TSR performance up to 31 March 2013 for the outstanding 2010, 2011 and 2012 SMP awards indicates that 67.1%, 73.8% and 0% of the maximum award will vest for each award respectively, reecting generally strong performance compared to the other companies in the TSR comparator group.
