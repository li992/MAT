We are constantly alert for new investment opportunities which meet our rigorous selection criteria.
We will only invest where an asset is likely to produce meaningful long term increases in value.
During the year a total of 20.5 million 2012 10.5 million was spent on additions to existing properties.
We have, during the period, seen a slight improvement in the terms being quoted for bank finance albeit that such funding is of a relatively short term nature, typically 7 years or less.
A healthy UK economy and, in particular, the property investment sector require a return to the market of more lenders offering longer term finance to fund the acquisition of long term assets.
