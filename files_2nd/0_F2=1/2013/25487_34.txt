In spite of ongoing uncertainty about the prospects of the world economy and nervousness in financial markets, our business momentum is positive and we believe that we are well positioned to face the future.
How do you incorporate environmental and sustainability considerations into your business?
In our role as a global asset manager, we recognise the responsibility that comes with being long-term stewards of our clients assets.
Key to this responsibility is continually ensuring that corporate governance and business integrity are a fundamental part of how we operate.
Our primary goal in doing this is both to benefit our clients and also to improve the 2 broader environmental and social realms in which we invest and operate.
Alongside the financial objectives that we set for ourselves as business, we also categorise our environmental, social and governance activity into three areas, being commitment to stewardship and our investment approach, people and planet.
