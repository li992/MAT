Secondly, our strategy of sharing technology between our power projects and local businesses has enabled us to introduce gas-fuelled power to Local markets, and this is driving growth in both volumes and margins: average gas megawatts on hire in the Local business increased by 40% year-onyear.
We have also won several contracts for our new HFO solution from industrial customers.
The other driver of underlying volume and trading profit growth has been our strategy of using the Local business to execute mini-projects: these we define as power contracts of 12MW or over, and of a duration of 3 months or longer, and which, were they in a territory where we did not have a Local business, would be accounted for within the Power Projects business.
As our Local business grows in scale and capability in emerging markets, these mini-projects are a fertile source of growth: and at the end of the year, we had over 260MW on rent in mini-projects.
