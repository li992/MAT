During 2013 the decision to cease future investment in digital still camera products reduced our forecasts of future cashflows for Camera products, resulting in a fall in the value in use of the Cameras cash generating unit CGu.
We therefore booked an impairment of $50.5 million to reduce the goodwill allocated to Cameras to $nil.
For further information see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, which explains how we test for impairment and the assumptions we use in this test.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment PPE During the year we invested $29.2 million in our PPE and intangible assets, the majority in new buildings and IT infrastructure following office moves in India, uS, uK and China.
Tangible and intangible assets of $26.4 million were impaired during 2013, relating to the decision to cease future investment in the digital still camera market as explained on pages 10 and 21.
We have contractual commitments for $1.9 million for the acquisition of other intangible assets and PPE.
For further information see notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax The increase in the deferred tax asset to $109.2 million at 27 December 2013 from $89.2 million at 28 December 2012 is mainly due to the increase in future tax deductions with respect to share options resulting from the increase in CSR plcs share price during 2013, together with increases in tax losses with regard to the release of historic provisions relating to the uS.
The deferred tax liability of $4.9 million principally relates to tax payable in future periods with respect to the Samsung Transaction.
Long-term asset Arising from the Samsung Transaction in 2012, this asset is available to meet specific types of warranty claims.
No such claims were received during 2013.
Inventory We aim to maintain sufficient inventory to enable us to meet our customer lead times, which are often short to meet the end customer patterns of demand.
We seek to balance this with our awareness and assessment of the pace of change in our consumer end market and the need to minimize working capital to earn returns for shareholders.
Inventory was $73.9 million compared to $87.8 million in 2012.
This 16% fall in inventory reflects the reduction in the number of different products that we offer as we withdraw from our legacy markets.
Improvements in forecasting processes have also reduced the volume of buffer stock held in order to ensure smooth customer order fulfilment.
Trade receivables Trade receivables represent 37 debtors days compared to 39 days in 2012.
The decrease reflects the change in customer base as, following the discontinuation of handset location and handset connectivity products, our average customer terms are now reduced.
