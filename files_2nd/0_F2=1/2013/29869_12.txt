DIRECTORS REPORT The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2013. BUSINESS REVIEW Principal Activity and Investment Status The Company is a public limited company in terms of the Companies Act 2006 and is an investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has been accepted as an approved investment trust by HM Revenue & Customs for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 April 2012 subject to continuing to meet the eligibility conditions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
The Directors are satisfied that the Company intends to direct its affairs to ensure its continued approval as an investment trust.
Investment Policy The objective of the Company is to provide long-term capital appreciation for its shareholders through investment in companies operating in emerging markets or whose stocks are listed on the stock markets of such countries.
No material change will be made to this policy without shareholder approval.
The Investment Manager employs a bottom-up, value oriented, long-term approach to investing.
It focuses on the market price of a company relative to the Investment Managers evaluation of the companys long-term earnings, asset value and cash flow potential.
As it looks for investment opportunities, it focuses on specific companies and undertakes in-depth research to construct an action list from which it makes its buy decisions.
Before a purchase is made, it looks at many factors including the companys long-term potential earnings as well as considering the companys position in its sector, the economic framework and political environment and its management capability and governance.
Risk is spread by investing in a number of countries and companies.
Where possible, investment will generally be made directly in the stock markets of emerging countries.
Where the Investment Manager determines appropriate, for example to gain access to markets closed to foreign portfolio investors, investment may be made in emerging markets through Collective Investment Schemes, although such investment is not likely to be substantial.
As at 31 March 2013 the Company had no such investments.
In addition, investment in companies listed on more developed countries stock exchanges may also be made where those companies have a significant source of their revenue from emerging countries.
The Investment Manager does not presently anticipate investing a significant part of the Companys assets in such companies.
Templeton Asset Management Ltd. TAML or the Investment Manager, the Investment Manager of the Company, will invest directly only in countries where it is satisfied that acceptable custodial and other arrangements are in place to safeguard TEMITs investments and in companies where there is evidence of satisfactory governance procedures.
It is intended that the Companys funds will normally be invested in equity investments.
However, the Investment Manager may invest in equity-related investments such as convertibles where there are believed to be advantages to so doing.
The portfolio may frequently be over-weight or under-weight against the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and may be concentrated into a more limited number of sectors, geographical areas or countries.
This is consistent with the stated investment approach of long-term value investing.
The Investment Manager evaluates investment opportunities with updated financial ratios on a daily basis, and, where opportunities are identified, adjusts the portfolio to seek optimal exposures to stocks which are assessed to be the best bargains in global emerging markets.
TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 33 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED The general policy of the Board is to be fully invested.
In response to market conditions, the Investment Manager may hold funds temporarily in cash or other appropriate assets.
Key Performance Indicators The following are considered key performance indicators for the Company: the return in net asset value per share compared to its benchmark: the movement in share price and discount: and the Ongoing Charges Ratio.
Performance The Investment Manager employs a value investing strategy and purchases companies trading at less than their assessed value.
In the year to 31 March 2013, the Companys net asset value per share produced a total return dividend reinvested of 11.1%.
This outperformed the Companys benchmark, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which returned 7.7%.
Since launch, the Company is well ahead of the benchmark as the net asset value total return for TEMIT is 2,530% 14.8% per annum compared with a total return of 1,064% 10.9% per annum for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Over 10 years the comparable returns for TEMIT are 541% 20.4% per annum compounded and 418% 17.9% per annum compounded for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
The graphs on page 5 show the total return of TEMITs NAV and share price relative to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the relative annual total return of TEMITs NAV and share price against the MSCI Emerging Markets Index over the last 10 years.
The Chairmans Statement on pages 6 to 8 and the Investment Managers Report on pages 16 to 27 include a review of the main developments during the year and the investment outlook.
Share Capital and Discount The Board has powers to buy back the Companys shares as a discount control mechanism when it is in the best interests of the Companys shareholders.
The Board was authorised at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 20 July 2012 to buy back up to 49,424,181 shares representing 14.99% of the Companys issued share capital on that date.
The present authority expires on the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2013.
The share price of TEMIT increased by 8.8% to 640.5 pence as at 31 March 2013 from 588.5 pence as at 31 March 2012.
Over the year, the Companys share price discount to NAV has been in the range of 6.1% to 10.7%.
As at 31 March 2013, the discount had widened slightly to 8.8% from 7.5% as at 31 March 2012.
Share Price Discount to NAV Share Price Discount to NAV % % 0.0 0.0 -5.0 -5.0 -10.0 -10.0 -15.0 -15.0 Mar-08 Mar-09 Mar-10 Mar-11 Mar-12 Mar-13 TEMIT Share Price Discount, based on a 15 day moving average Source: Franklin Templeton Investments 34 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC During the year 1,939,460 shares of 25 pence each were repurchased, representing 0.59% of the issued share capital as at 31 March 2012, at a cost to the Company of 11.1 million.
These shares were cancelled which resulted in a small uplift to the net asset value per share.
In the period from 1 April to 24 May 2013, 149,000 shares were bought back and cancelled by the Company.
Ongoing Charges Ratio The Ongoing Charges Ratio OCR represents the annualised ongoing charges of the Company divided by the average daily net asset values of the Company for the year.
The OCR decreased marginally to 1.30% for the year end 31 March 2013 1.31%: 31 March 2012.
Costs associated with the purchase and sale of investments are taken to capital and are not included in the OCR.
Transaction costs totalled 254,000 for the year to 31 March 2013 2012: 183,000.
Results and Dividends The capital gain for the year was 206.3 million 2012: 281.5 million loss and the revenue profit was 27.8 million 2012: 26.1 million.
The full results for the Company are disclosed in the Income Statement on page 54.
The Directors propose an ordinary dividend of 6.25 pence per share 2012: 5.75 pence.
The dividend represents an 8.7% increase on the amount paid last year.
If approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 12 July 2013, the ordinary dividend will be payable on 17 July 2013 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 14 June 2013.
Gearing The Board has agreed that in exceptional circumstances, and for short periods, TEMIT may borrow up to 10% of its net assets.
During the last two years the Company did not utilise its short term borrowing facility.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by your Board, are summarised below.
The Board monitors risk on a quarterly basis as part of the Board meetings including benchmark and performance attribution, risk analysis, contributors and detractors, major overweight and underweights and portfolio information including purchases and sales.
In addition the Directors, on an annual basis, receive a comprehensive risk and control analysis identifying the areas of risk and mitigating controls which are in place.
As part of this review, the Directors also ensure that the Companys primary service providers have adopted an appropriate framework of controls, monitoring and reporting to enable the Directors to evaluate these risks.
Investment and Concentration risk The Company may invest a significant portion of its assets in the securities of one issuer, securities domiciled in a particular country, or securities within one industry.
In addition, emerging markets can be subject to greater price volatility and more rapid and severe re-rating than developed markets.
In periods of pronounced volatility, the differential between emerging market stocks, markets and countries decreases.
In such times, the benefits that diversification generally provides are reduced.
As a result of both these factors, there is the potential for increased concentration risk in terms of economic, business and political exposures which may result in greater fluctuation in the value of the portfolio.
TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 35 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Market risk Many of the companies in which TEMIT does or may invest are, by reason of the locations in which they operate, exposed to the risk of political or economic change.
In addition, exchange control, tax or other regulations introduced in any country in which TEMIT invests may affect its income and the value and marketability of its investments.
Investors in emerging markets may face settlement and custodial problems.
Furthermore, companies in emerging markets are not always subject to accounting, auditing and financial standards which are equivalent to those applicable in the UK and there may also be less government supervision and regulation.
These risks can increase the potential for losses in the Company and affect its share price.
For these reasons, a long-term approach to investing in emerging markets is taken.
Foreign currency risk Currency movements may affect TEMITs performance.
In general, if the value of sterling increases compared with a foreign currency, an investment traded in that foreign currency will decrease in value because it will be worth less in UK sterling.
This can have a negative effect on fund performance.
Conversely, when, in general, sterling weakens in relation to a foreign currency, investments traded in that foreign currency will increase in value, which can contribute to an improvement in the Companys performance.
TEMIT does not hedge this risk.
Credit risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the investment purchase or cash in relation to sale or declared dividend after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
Operational and custody risk Like many other investment trust companies, the Company has no employees.
The Company therefore relies upon the services provided by third parties and is dependent upon the control systems of the Investment Manager and the Companys service providers.
The security, for example, of the Companys assets, dealing procedures, accounting records and maintenance of regulatory and legal requirements depend on the effective operation of these systems.
These are regularly tested and monitored and an internal control report, which includes an assessment of risks together with an overview of procedures to mitigate such risks, is prepared by the Secretary and Administrator and reviewed by the Audit Committee annually.
The global custodian JPMorgan Chase Bank produces a bi-annual SSAE 16 ISAE 3402 report which is reviewed by its auditor and gives assurance regarding the effective operation of controls.
As part of the annual risk and controls review, the Audit Committee reviewed the global custody risk assessment for TEMIT.
This concluded that while there are inherent custody risks in investing in emerging markets, the custody network employed by TEMIT has appropriate controls in place to mitigate those risks, and that these controls are consistent with recommended industry practices and standards.
Key personnel The ability of the Company to achieve its investment objective is significantly dependent upon the expertise of the Investment Manager and its ability to attract and retain suitable staff.
The Investment Manager has endeavoured to ensure that the principal members of their management teams are suitably incentivised, but the retention of such staff cannot be guaranteed.
Regulatory risk The Company operates in an increasingly complex regulatory environment and faces a number of regulatory risks.
A breach of s1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 or the accompanying Investment Trust Approved Company Tax Regulations 2011 may potentially result in the Company being subject to corporation tax on chargeable gains on realised portfolio gains.
The Company is required to comply with the European Unions Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive AIFMD by July 2014, as it is deemed to be an alternative investment fund within the scope of the Directive.
The 36 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC Directive aims to place alternative investment vehicles into a regulated framework, in order to monitor and regulate their activity, with a particular focus on risk management.
The Company is currently engaged in ensuring that it will be compliant by the deadline, and is working jointly with the Investment Manager to achieve this.
Breaches of other regulations, such as the UKLA Listing Rules, could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and reputational damage.
Further information on the risks that TEMIT is subject to including additional financial and valuation risks are also detailed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
FINANCIAL Share Capital Changes in the share capital of the Company are set out in Note 9 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Going Concern The Companys assets consist of equity shares in companies listed on recognised stock exchanges and in most circumstances are realisable within a short timescale.
Having made suitable enquiries, including considerations of the Companys investment objective, the nature of the portfolio, expenditure forecasts and the principal risks and uncertainties described within the Annual Report, the Directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue to operate as a going concern for the foreseeable future and, as such, a going concern basis is appropriate in preparing the financial statements.
Creditor Payment Policy Investment transactions are settled by the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant market.
While the Company follows no formal code, its policy is to agree the terms of payment at the start of business and ensure that the supplier is aware of the terms of payment.
Payment is made in accordance with these terms provided that the supplier is also complying with all the relevant terms and conditions.
For the year ended 31 March 2013 the number of trade broker creditor days was 1 day 2012: 1 day.
Auditor Deloitte LLP has expressed a willingness to continue in office as auditor and a resolution proposing its reappointment will be submitted at the Annual General Meeting.
The Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte LLP, who were appointed in 2009, be reappointed as the Companys auditor.
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditor was unaware and that each Director had taken all steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditor was aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provision of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 37 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED DIRECTORS Directors The Board currently comprises seven Non-Executive Directors, six of whom are independent from Franklin Templeton Investments, the group of companies associated with the Companys Investment Manager.

TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 39 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Performance Evaluation The Board has undertaken a formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors including the Chairman.
The Board has also considered the independence of each Director.
In 2012 the Board evaluation was carried out by an external facilitator, Trust Associates Limited.
This year, the Chairman led the evaluation process which included a review of the changes made following last years evaluation.
The process was based on questionnaires and discussions between the Chairman and each Director.
The experience, balance of skills, diversity and knowledge of the Board was considered as well as Board effectiveness, role and structure.
An evaluation of the Chairman by his fellow Directors was facilitated by Sir Peter Burt, the Senior Independent Director, who then met with the Chairman to discuss its content.

The terms also provide that a Director may be removed following three months notice and that compensation will not be due on leaving office.
Directors Conflicts of Interest The Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act sets out directors general duties.
Under the 2006 Act, a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Companys interests.
The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a Director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation.
The 2006 Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect.
The Companys Articles give the Directors authority to approve such situations.
There are safeguards which apply when Directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
Firstly, only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered are able to make the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Companys success.
The Directors are able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
The Company maintains a register of Directors conflicts of interest which have been disclosed and approved by the other Directors.
This register is kept up to date and the Directors annually complete an updated conflicts of interest questionnaire disclosing any conflicts or potential conflicts.
Gregory Johnson is not present when the performance of the Investment Manager and the Secretary and Administrator are considered.

TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 43 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Environmental, Social, Community and Ethical Issues As an investment trust, the Company has no significant direct social, community or environmental responsibilities.
Its ethical policy is focused on ensuring that its funds are properly managed and invested within the guidelines approved by the Board.
The Board receives regular reports on the policies and controls in place.
The Investment Manager invests in companies that it considers to be well managed and subject to appropriate corporate governance.
A well-managed company is considered to be one which complies with all the relevant legislation and which meets the environmental, social, community and ethical requirements of the country in which it operates.
It is important to recognise that local laws and requirements of emerging markets do not necessarily equate with those of developed countries.
Environmental, social, and governance issues have become increasingly important to companies worldwide as they seek to balance organisational goals with the expectations of their stakeholders in an increasingly complex operating environment.
When companies manage these stakeholder relationships effectively, they are more successful at managing risks and capturing opportunities placing them in a better position for long-term success.
As a long-term investor, the Investment Manager performs extensive bottom-up investment analysis, employing rigorous and comprehensive processes to assess both the risk and return potential of the investments it considers for the Company.
The depth of its research provides comprehensive insights into the many factors that affect the value of an investment, which may include environmental, social and governance issues.
The Investment Manager determines the extent to which various research inputs are included and weighted in its investment decisions.
Institutional Shareholder Voting and Engagement As an institutional investor, the Company recognises its responsibility that the companies in which it invests should aspire to appropriate levels of corporate governance.
As a matter of policy, the Company aims to utilise its votes in shares held in the relevant underlying portfolio companies at the annual general meetings of these companies.
The Company has engaged with the Investment Manager in relation to its approach to the Stewardship Code the Code.
The Company and the Investment Manager generally support the Principles of the Code as outlined below.
On-going monitoring of investee companies and dialogue with management are fundamental to the Investment Managers investment approach.
The strategy on intervention with investee companies is dealt with on a case by case basis and is usually a judgement made by the Investment Manager based on the research done on each investee company for the investment decision making progress.
In all cases, the Investment Manager holds regular review meetings with the senior management of investee companies.
In exceptional circumstances, the Investment Manager may provide a director to the investee company.
The Investment Manager considers the key objectives are to seek to obtain value for the Company and to comply with its fiduciary duties.
The level of engagement with investee companies derives from the fiduciary duties of the Investment Manager to the Company.
Thus, for example, in voting shares, the Investment Manager considers what would be in the best interests of the Company.
Similarly, there will be many instances in which actions such as a dialogue between the Investment Manager and the management of investee companies, or with other shareholders, may help to maximise shareholder value.
At the same time, there may be instances in which activism is not consistent with the Investment Managers fiduciary duty.
For example, in the process of company research and monitoring, a significant problem or risk may be identified and the Investment Manager may decide it is better simply to sell a position than seek to undertake a lengthy engagement with management.
Decisions involving when and how to engage with management or carry out collective engagement are matters of judgement.
Consequently, there are no set guidelines adopted on when this should occur.
The Investment Manager has adopted proxy voting policies and procedures which cover voting guidelines, processing and maintenance of proxy records and conflicts of interest.
44 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC Summary information on exercise of proxies is reviewed quarterly by the Board.
Voting records for the Company detailing the proxies voted for investee companies are not currently published.
The Company considers that there is limited demand for such detailed disclosure and therefore the administrative burden and expense is not justified.
Contact with Shareholders The Chairman of the Company is available for any shareholder questions and he has periodic meetings with the Companys major shareholders.
Furthermore, the Members of the Board are available during the year for any significant matters arising and are usually present in person at the Annual General Meeting.
At each Annual General Meeting of the Company the Investment Manager briefs shareholders on the investment outlook of the Company.
In addition, on behalf of the Board, it has periodic meetings with the Companys major shareholders to discuss aspects of the Companys performance.
Shareholders may contact the Members of the Board via Client Dealer Services at FTIML using the contact details provided on the inside back cover of this report.
Accountability and Audit The Board has an Audit Committee, which currently comprises Peter Harrison Chairman of the Audit Committee, Sir Peter Burt, Neil Collins and Hamish Buchan.
The Audit Committee plays an important role in the appraisal and supervision of key aspects of the Companys business including financial reporting and internal controls.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will attend the Companys Annual General Meeting and will be prepared to respond to questions which may be raised by shareholders on matters within the Audit Committees responsibilities.
The Companys Audit Committee meets representatives of the Investment Manager and Secretary and Administrator, including their internal auditors and its Compliance Officer, who report as to the proper conduct of business in accordance with the regulatory environment in which both the Company and the Investment Manager operate.
The Companys external auditor also attend the Committee at its request, at least twice a year, and report on its work procedures, the quality of the Companys accounting procedures and their findings in relation to the Companys statutory accounts.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include review of the internal financial controls, risk monitoring, accounting policies, financial statements, the management contract, the auditors appointment, remuneration, independence, policy on supplying non-audit services, the effectiveness of the external audit and ensuring continued auditor independence.
To assess the effectiveness of the external audit process, the auditor is asked on an annual basis to set out the steps that they have taken to ensure objectivity and independence.
The auditors performance, behaviour and effectiveness during the exercise of their duties are monitored, and this informs the Audit Committees unanimous decision to recommend reappointment.
Based on their review, the Board recommends the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the Companys auditor.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee reflect the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
A copy of the terms of reference of the Audit Committee is available to shareholders on the TEMIT website www.
Deloitte LLP was appointed auditor from 27 August 2009.
Non-audit work undertaken by Deloitte LLP for the year ended 31 March 2013 on behalf of TEMIT includes a review of the September 2012 Half Yearly Report and working with TEMIT in liaising with the New Zealand authorities in relation to audit requirements for TEMIT.
An engagement letter is issued for all non-audit work and subsequently reviewed by the Audit Committee to ensure that the independence and objectivity of the auditor is safeguarded.
TEMIT is able to rely on the Financial Reporting Act Dual-listed Issuers Exemption Notice, issued on 27 March 2013 which exempts it from requirements in the New Zealand Financial Reporting Act 1993.
This exemption recognises that companies with a primary listing in the United Kingdom prepare financial statements and are audited in accordance with UK requirements.
This allows TEMIT to be exempted from the New Zealand requirement that firms be audited by a New Zealand unlimited liability entity.
TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 45 DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Risk Management Objectives and Policy The Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term to achieve its investment objectives as stated on page 33.

The Companys policy and objectives in relation to such risks is disclosed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Internal Control The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that a sound system of internal controls of the Company is maintained to safeguard shareholders investment and the Companys assets.
The Audit Committee undertakes an annual review of the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls and the Directors believe that an appropriate framework is in place to meet the requirement of ensuring that a sound system of internal controls is in place by the Company.
The Board has an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing risks to which the Company is exposed.
This process is conducted throughout the year and has been conducted up to the date of signing of this report.

It has to be understood that systems of internal control, however carefully designed, operated and supervised, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Company does not have its own internal audit function but places reliance on the internal audit, compliance and other control functions of its service providers.
