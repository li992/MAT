KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Measuring performance: to assess progress We assess our performance against the following key performance indicators, each of which is linked to our long-term strategy OPTIMISING our operating efficiencies to leverage the highest returns from our existing assets 1 1 1 1 EBITDA Cash cost per ounce sold Cash cost per tonne milled All-in sustaining cost US$million US$ Oz US$ tonne US$ Oz 10 419.2 10 10 569 10 55 917 11 545.5 11 692 11 65 11 1,114 12 336.3 12 941 12 74 12 1,585 13 240.4 13 827 13 67 13 1,379 US$240.4million US$827 Oz US$67 tonne US$1,379 Oz Performance EBITDA for the year was Cash cost per ounce sold for the Cash cost per tonne milled for the AISC for the year was US$1,362 per US$240 million, a 29% decrease year was US$827 per ounce, a year was US$67 per tonne milled, a ounce sold, a decrease of 14% on on 2012, mainly as a result of the 12% reduction on 2012, as a result of 9% reduction on 2012, as a result of 2012, as a result of achieving cost drop in the gold price driving achieving cost savings in our operating achieving cost savings in our operating savings in our operating environment, lower revenue.

"It is a valuable indicator of our All-in sustaining cost AISC per ounce sold is calculated by taking the ability to generate operating cash ""ow to fund working capital and capital aggregate of cash costs and adding corporate administration costs, reclamation expenditures and to service debt obligations."
and remediation costs for operating mines, corporate social responsibility Cash cost per ounce sold is calculated by dividing the aggregate of cash costs by expenses, mine exploration and study costs, capitalised stripping and underground gold ounces sold.
It is one of the key indicators that we use to monitor and development costs and sustaining capital expenditure.
This is then divided by the manage those factors that impact production costs on a monthly basis.
It is intended to provide additional information on the total sustaining cost for each ounce sold in order to provide additional clarity as to the full cost of production.
