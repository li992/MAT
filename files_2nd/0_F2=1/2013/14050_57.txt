Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2013 Directors Report Corporate Governance Report Chairmans Letter Dear Shareholder At Serco, we are committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance, integrity and business ethics in all our activities around the world.
Governance is not an exercise in compliance nor is it a specific form of management.
For Serco, our framework of governance is how we ensure the best interests of all our stakeholders our customers, our employees, our shareholders, and the societies and communities of which we are a part are uppermost in all our minds as we go about our business, and that where these interests are not directly aligned, we make decisions on the basis of what is right: this is an essential part of our public service ethos.
During 2013, we found ourselves challenged at the heart of the way in which we do business.
A number of individuals were found to be acting outside our values as epitomised by our Governing Principles and our framework of governance had not identified sufficiently clearly the root causes that had allowed this to happen.
This challenged the trust in which we are held by our customers, our employees, and society at large.
In response, the Company has designed and implemented a comprehensive programme of corporate renewal to ensure we respond appropriately to these root causes and put in place the actions, systems and processes to deliver stronger, more effective governance, organisational change and operational resilience across the Group.
In the following pages, we describe what we are doing in this programme of corporate renewal, and outline the work of the Board and the governance framework we have designed to meet the current needs of our businesses around the world.
We also explain how we have applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code in the financial year.
To illustrate how our governance arrangements work in practice, we have redesigned this Corporate Governance Report around the key elements of the Boards role: leadership, effectiveness, accountability and engaging with shareholders.
Board focus In my Chairmans Statement I speak about the independent reviews of our culture and systems that we commissioned last year to understand the root causes of the issues that had arisen.
It was these reviews that informed the design of our programme of corporate renewal, the key components of which are as follows: Commitment by our leadership throughout the business to do what is right by always dealing with customers fairly and placing this above any other conflicting drivers for success Revising Sercos Code of Conduct, Values Statement and Governing Principles, backed up by training, induction and performance management Strengthening contract level governance, including improved contract bid processes to ensure appropriate levels of operational resource and the delivery of sustainable performance Enhancing transparency and access, with robust reporting of operational and financial contract KPIs, and greater engagement of customers at contract and departmental level Creating a separate division for our UK Central Government work to achieve both focus and openness for Government as a collective customer Developing our management system to include more prescriptive guidance on required operational processes and procedures, supported by strengthened risk management and internal audit processes and capabilities Appointing three additional Board Non-Executive Directors, one of whom will chair a new Corporate Responsibility Committee to formalise the process of guidance and decision making on ethical issues more detail of this new Committee can be found on page 81 Establishing formal Ethics Committees and Ethics Officers in each division, accompanied by the redesign of our whistle-blowing process to the highest international standards, and Measuring the progress of attitudinal change throughout the organisation with ongoing independent culture and ethics reviews.
Our Board established a Committee of the Board the Board Oversight Committee to oversee the programme.
The various reviews and audits undertaken by the UK Government were completed during the year and found no further evidence of wrongdoing or malpractice.
Lord Gold was appointed as an independent third-party member of this Committee.
The full and effective implementation of this programme is fundamental to our future success as a company that seeks to work in partnership with its customers around the world delivering services to taxpayers.
It is managements top priority, something that will be appropriately reflected in the structure of management incentivisation.
I am pleased to say that to date they are on plan to achieve their various milestones and that the plan to implement this programme has received a positive assessment by the Government Oversight Group, with the input of the independent advisers appointed by the UK Government who will continue to monitor the Companys implementation against the agreed milestones.
Going forward, through leadership, training and guidance, and appropriate incentivisation, we will change the balance of drivers within our business such that the commitment to do what is right and to deal with our customers fairly and transparently always transcends that sustained drive to succeed.
This will be supported by the right management structures and controls and best-in-class lines of assurance to ensure that through early identification of risks and issues and their swift resolution we never again compromise on our values and ethics.
In summary, this plan seeks to ensure that never again does someone amongst our 120,000 people do the wrong thing because they do not want to fail to meet their commercial objectives.
And if they do the wrong thing, we will have the controls in place to make sure the problem is identified at an early stage, acted on, and the lessons learned.
Despite the exceptional events of last year that required my and my colleagues absolute focus and that dominated our agenda for the second half of 2013, the Board has continued its programme of meeting local management with the Board conducting some of its meetings at operational sites.
A number of Board members also undertook tours of international sites to deepen Non-Executive Directors understanding of the day to day activities of the business.
60 Directors Report Board skills and diversity After 10 years service, David Richardson stood down from the Board at the Companys Annual General Meeting held on 15 May 2013.
We are grateful to David for his contribution to the Company as both Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Malcolm Wyman, who joined the Board in January 2013, succeeded David in these roles.
Malcolms significant financial and international business experience makes him well placed to make a strong contribution.
In last years report, I outlined our approach to Board diversity, with particular reference to the Lord Davies of Abersochs report Women on Boards, and emphasised our commitment to boardroom diversity, of which gender is one of several aspects.
We also stated an aim to achieve appropriate diversity across all elements of Sercos management.
I am delighted that since I last wrote to you, in addition to Malcolm, we have secured the services of three new Non-Executive Directors, who bring a broad range of skills and experience to complement our current Board, and of whom two are female.
Each has a great track-record in their particular field of expertise and will add much to the debate around our board table.
More information on all members of the Board can be found on pages 62 to 64.
With these appointments, a third of the Board is female but these are all non-executive members.
I believe there is an increasing recognition that the real issue is not Board composition but the balance of women in senior executive positions.
It is this that will provide the opportunity for talented women to become directors, both executive and non-executive, and it is here that, in my view, we should be focusing.
Within Serco we are, therefore, maintaining our focus on diversity across our management team.
At present, 12.5% of our senior managers are female and we will be seeking to increase this over time.
Leadership and effectiveness As you can see from the above there was considerable change during 2013 to our company and our Board.
With the appointments announced today around half our directors will be new during 2014.
Given this extent of change during, and the exceptional events of last year which in turn caused Board activity that was abnormal both in quantum and nature, I decided that it would not be constructive to undertake our normal annual internal review of Board effectiveness.
I have mentioned above the reviews that we undertook during 2013 into our culture and systems of control.
These extended to the Board and the Board discussed their findings which in turn has resulted in changes to our governance framework, including our Board composition.
Alastair Lyons CBE Chairman Compliance statement Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2013, Serco Group plc complied fully with all relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code with the exception of membership of the Audit Committee as explained in the Audit Committee Report on pages 75 to 79 and undertaking a formal internal review of the effectiveness of the Board, its committees and individual members in accordance with Code B.
