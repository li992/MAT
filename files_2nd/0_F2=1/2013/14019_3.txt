the group has identified six key drivers that will support growth over the comingyears.
GLOBAL GDP Examples in this area include the Boeing 787, LARGE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BUILD RATES Growth in global GDP will have a direct impact B737 MAX, the Airbus A350, A320neo and The Group has healthy shipset content on all on a number of the Groups market demand both Bombardiers and Gulfstreams next key large commercial aircraft platforms, and the drivers.
The most notable of these are global families of business jets.
The new engine Boeing and Airbus order books have continued passenger air kilometres flown, which will drive versions of the leading narrow-bodied aircraft, to grow in 2013, now standing at record levels higher demand for new commercial aircraft.
