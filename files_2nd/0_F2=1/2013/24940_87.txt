HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Report of the Directors: Financial Review continued Capital Appendix to Capital Leverage ratio Corporate Governance Report Letter from the Group Chairman Leverage ratio: basis of preparation Unaudited The estimated tier 1 capital figure is based on an end point Basel III definition of tier 1 capital applicable from 1 January 2022, applying the final CRD IV rules published in June 2013.
We have calculated our tier 1 capital in accordance with the basis of preparation outlined on page 324.
We also disclose an estimated leverage ratio which includes, in our tier 1 capital, instruments that will be ineligible for inclusion after the Basel III transitional period has fully elapsed.
The total exposures are calculated according to the December 2010 Basel III rules text, the instructions for the Basel III July 2012 Quantitative Impact Study, its related Frequently Asked Questions and the PRAs guidance on the methodologies used there.
They are based on financial accounting rules for onand off-balance exposures, adjusted as follows: the scope of netting for derivatives and securities financing transactions SFTs is extended to all scenarios where we would recognise a netting agreement for Basel II regulatory purposes, except for cross-product netting which is not permitted.
For SFTs, only cash payables and receivables are netted and not securities provided or received: the inclusion of potential future exposure add-ons for both OTC and exchange-traded derivatives: off-balance sheet items are included in full except for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by HSBC without prior notice, where only 10% of the exposures are included: the exclusion of items deducted from the calculation of end point tier 1 capital: and for investments in banking associates that are equity accounted in the financial accounting consolidation but proportionally consolidated for regulatory purposes, the accounting treatment is used.
It should be noted that this PRA-prescribed basis for disclosing the leverage ratio is not at this time aligned with the November 2013 supervisory statement, the CRD IV final rules or the Basel Committees final proposals on the Basel III leverage ratio.
