While this term is not commonplace in the UK, in South Africa it refers to the over-arching aims of the entire process of Black Economic Empowerment, and changing how business is done.
In our case, we have committed to certain outcomes through the SLPs to which our new order mineral rights are subject and to a series of initiatives outlined at the 2013 AGM.
In addition, there are many other actions we believe are necessary to be a good corporate citizen and retain our social licence to operate which support the aims of the SLPs and transformation.
7.1 Role of the Transformation Committee The Transformation Committee has delegated authority from the Board set out in its written terms of reference, available on the Companys website, which were last reviewed by the Board in March 2012.
The primary purpose of the Committee is to ensure that the Company meets or exceeds its commitments and obligations in the areas of transformation and empowerment, and that the interests of all stakeholders including shareholders are properly recognised when doing so, with its principal duties being: to develop strategies, policies and processes and set goals and targets for transformation and empowerment, and assess the means by which such strategies are proposed to be implemented and goals achieved, with the goal of ensuring that there is a disciplined, co-ordinated and sustainable approach to transformation: to monitor, review and evaluate progress made by management in meeting the Companys obligations in respect of transformation and empowerment, including the Companys adherence to applicable legal and regulatory requirements and external commitments made in relation to the same: to ensure effective communication on transformation issues between management, the Board and various stakeholders: and to guide and otherwise provide encouragement and counsel to management in relation to transformation and empowerment.
7.2 Composition of the Transformation Committee The members of the Committee include all of the Directors resident in South Africa, together with those with the greatest experience of doing business there, and are disclosed in section 1.8 of this report.
Meetings of the Committee are attended by the EVP Human Resources and the Company Secretary who acts as secretary to the Committee, neither of whom do so as of right.
Other senior managers and Board members attend as needed when specialist input is required.
7.3 Activities of the Transformation Committee during the year Given the nature of the social conditions revealed by what we have previously referred to as the Events at Marikana, the profile and strategic importance of many of the issues captured under the heading of transformation is such that they have been considered at Board level.
As a result, the Committee only met twice during the year, though all other Board Directors were invited to attend those meetings, as summarised in section 1.8 of this report.
The Committee has an annual work plan, developed from its terms of reference with standing items that the Committee considers at each meeting in addition to matters of topical relevance or on which the Committee has otherwise chosen to focus.
The material items considered by the Committee in FY2013 were: Implementation Strategy Governance, regulatory and reporting Reviewed progress against the Considered strategies to improve Considered strategies for better objectives of our SLPs to be employee living conditions across communication of BEE assessed as at end 2012 and five interlinked areas: achievements to local community the targets contained in the and wider audiences Employee relations Mining Charter Scorecard Considered and approved the Empowerment to be assessed as at end 2014, appointment of an independent Migrant and local labour and in transformation matters external assurance provider to generally Shift patterns assess the Companys Reviewed progress reports on the performance against its Mining Housing and Living projects supporting the five social Charter Scorecard targets Conditions intervention initiatives announced Reviewed preliminary results of at the 2014 AGM research on revised shift patterns Received an update on industrial Deep dive on progress with relations, including a review of the initiatives on housing and living trade union memberships of our conditions employees www.
