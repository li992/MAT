We established ViiV Healthcare with Pfizer in 2009, to focus on HIV treatment and research.
After a long-term collaboration on the joint development of several novel medicines, we were joined by Shionogi in 2012.
In 2013, ViiV Healthcare received approval for Tivicay dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, providing patients with a new treatment option.

0081355 Our priorities We remain confident in our ability to sustain pipeline delivery, with a key focus for 2014 and 2015 being the delivery of phase III data for six potential new medicines and vaccines.
We are also planning for phase III stage progressions for around ten new products in key areas such as respiratory, oncology and vaccines in 2014 15.
Driving improvements in ways of working across the R&D organisation will continue to be a priority, so that increasing levels of output can be maintained without increased expenditure.
