Loulo-Gounkoto delivered a significant year on year improvement with the Loulo underground operations making The Loulo 0 deposit now called Gara was discovered in 1981 the largest contribution.
Gold production of 580 364oz in 2013 by the Bureau of Geology and Mining Research of France was up 15% on the prior year primarily as a result of increased BRGM and Randgold acquired 20% of the holding company throughput and grades and this resulted in a 3% decrease in Somilo SA in 1996 with the right to earn an additional 31% total cash cost per ounce to US$704 oz for the year.
In the same year the Yalea deposit was discovered which led to an increase in total Gold sales totalled US$808.3 million in 2013, reflecting the resources to 3.0Moz.
In 1997 Randgold acquired the remaining increased production, but were less than the prior year as 29% stake in the company taking its ownership to 80%.
A a result of the 17% drop in the average gold price received.
Total royalties paid to the State amounted to US$48.6 million final feasibility study encompassing both the Loulo and Gara open pit orebodies was completed in 2003 and construction and cash operating costs totalled US$365.1 million, resulting of the mine commenced in 2004.
