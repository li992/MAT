Another key tool used to communicate to both institutional investors and private investors is the Annual General Meeting AGM which is held at the Group headquarters in Kings Langley.
Shareholders are given a minimum of 21 days notice of the meeting and are provided with details of each substantially separate issue which will be raised for voting at the meeting, the results of which will be made available immediately after the meeting.
The key event of the day will be the full presentation to shareholders made by the executives to explain recent and future developments in the business followed by an open question and answer session.
The Board, EMB and senior engineers will be available for discussion after the formal proceedings and shareholders will also be invited to visit demonstration rooms displaying technology in Group or partners products with senior employees on hand to give in-depth detail of the Groups technologies and products.
Conflicts of interest All directors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation in which they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Group.
The Group has put in place procedures for the disclosure and review of any conflicts or potential conflicts of interest which the directors may have and for the authorisation of such conflict matters by the Board.
In deciding whether to authorize a conflict, or potential conflict, the directors have regard to their general duties under the Companies Act 2006.
The authorisation of any conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation, may be reviewed at any time and are reviewed formally by the Group on an annual basis.
There have been no conflicts of interest in the year.
