In 2012 we returned $315.1 million to shareholders of which $284.3 million was returned in a Tender Offer and the remainder was returned as part of share buyback programmes or as dividends.

CSR holds cash funds with differing rates of liquidity.
Funds that are immediately available or held on short term deposit are called cash and cash equivalents whilst funds placed on deposit for more than 90 days care called treasury deposits.
These cash funds are disclosed separately on the face of our balance sheet.
We use treasury deposits in order to access higher financing returns as we deem that this cash is not needed for immediate business operations.
During 2013, improvements in cash forecasting and treasury management allowed us to hold 26% of our total cash balance as treasury deposits 2012 6%.

Auto underlying operating profit was $3.2 million in 2012 compared to $10.6 million in 2011, due to increased investment in new products that either launched at the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013.
Consumer During 2012, the overall revenue in our Consumer segment increased by 56% to $258.7 million This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenue and profit from business lines acquired in the Zoran acquisition reporting $168.7 million for the full 2012 financial year, compared to $58.9 million for four months in 2011.
Camera revenue on a like for like basis for the full year declined slightly compared to 2011, due to the marked shift in consumer led demand away from digital still cameras to the use of smartphones.
Revenue in gaming was also lower although we continued to supply the two main companies that utilised Bluetooth for their gaming controllers.
The underlying operating loss for Consumer in 2012 was $15.6 million compared to a loss of $8.0 million in 2012.
This reflects significant investment in Bluetooth Smart and Indoor Location nascent technologies in order to develop new product offerings.
This large scale investment for future growth, in areas with limited 2012 revenues significantly impacted Consumer profitability.
Voice & Music Revenue for Voice & Music was $190.2 million in 2012, compared to $149.9 million in 2011.
We saw strong consumer demand in the relatively new markets of stereo headsets, active speakers and speaker docks.
2012 underlying operating profit grew in the year to $75.1 million 2011 $59.5 million, due to the revenue changes mentioned above, which changed the mix towards higher margin product lines.
Legacy Legacy revenue was $364.3 million 35% of total revenue compared to $324.7 million in 2011 38%.
After completing the Samsung Transaction in October 2012, we discontinued developing further products for the handset connectivity and handset location markets, and as a consequence revenue from these products was transferred into the Legacy segment.
