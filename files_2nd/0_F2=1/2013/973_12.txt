64 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 Strategic report BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our Thermal Coal business operates in South Africa and GENERATING POWER Colombia.
In South Africa, Thermal Coal wholly owns FROM THE SUN and operates seven mines.
It also has a 73% stake in Anglo American Inyosi Coal AAIC, a broad-based black economic empowerment entity.
AAIC wholly owns two mines, Kriel and Zibulo, and has a 50% interest in the Phola washing plant, a joint operation with BHP Billiton.
In addition, Thermal Coal has a 50% interest in the Mafube colliery, ajoint operation with Exxaro.
The South African mines supply both the export and domestic markets, delivering thermal coal domestically to Eskom, the state-owned power utility and Sasol, a coal-toliquids producer.
Exports are currently routed through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal RBCT, in which it has a 24.2% shareholding, to customers throughout the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Asia-Pacific regions.
In Colombia, AngloAmerican, BHP Billiton and Mining is an energy-intensive business.
