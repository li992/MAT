By the end of Q3 2013, a fourth crusher and overall optimisation of the crusher circuit grid-to-generated power ratio of 98% had been achieved, should see the mill tonnage throughput continue to improve significantly reducing powerhouse fuel consumption and towards the targeted 4.4Mtpa rate.
During Q4, a CIE transformer feeding the mine substation failed which led to some grid power instability Gold recovery remained on a par with the previous years being experienced during December.
