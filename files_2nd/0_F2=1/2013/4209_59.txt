Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in this table.
During 2013, Steve Foots was paid 72,500 2012: 62,500, Sean Christie was paid 34,642 2012: 32,542 and Keith Layden was paid 57,680 2012: 54,750 in addition to their basic salary to enable them to make independent provision for their retirement.
This contribution reflects the introduction of a cap to the maximum salary on which benefits at retirement are based under the CPS or, in the case of Keith Layden, the full provision.
Accordingly, for Steve Foots and Sean Christie benefits above this cap are now provided by a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits above the cap of 187,500.
The cap will reduce to 150,000 in April 2014.
