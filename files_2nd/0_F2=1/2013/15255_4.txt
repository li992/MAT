Business review Regional review UK & Ireland Applied Sterilisation Technologies Ethylene oxide expansion will increase processing capacity at Thorne.
In operation since 1998, our site at Thorne, Doncaster, offers ethylene oxide sterilisation plus associated laboratory services to the healthcare sector.
Twochambers have been added to the facility, doubling site capacity.
The chambers have usable capacity to allow batch processing of 14 Euro pallets, or 8 standard pallets.
Both processing lines have beenequipped with parametric capability that allows for faster product release following sterilisation.
