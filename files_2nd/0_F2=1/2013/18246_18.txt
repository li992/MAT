So far as the UK is concerned it has been reported that the economy avoided a double-dip recession.
Unfortunately the overall rate of growth is presently so feeble as to be barely detectable, although recently there have been some voices anticipating real improvement.
Within the UK the London market is continuing to drive ahead and now seems to be uncoupled from the rest of the country where we have seen only modest growth and in some cases values have continued to slip.
This trend looks set for the immediate future.
Fortunately the majority of our UK properties are situated in and around London.
We have a diversified portfolio which is well placed to benefit from those parts of the market which are likely to experience growth in the coming year.
Our focus continues to be on delivering steady long term growth in profits and asset values by the application of our entrepreneurial but prudent approach to business.
Experience shows that this approach has served us well over the years and will continue to do so in the future.
Our sincere thanks must go to our dedicated and hardworking staff for their efforts on behalf of the Group throughout the year.
