INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT Market Environment The U. S. loan market, as measured by the S&P LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, returned 5.29% for the full year 2013 which was in line with our forecast of 5-6%.
Performance was generally strong throughout the year with only two months of negative performance, June and August.
Furthermore, looking at the components of return, only 0.33% was from price with the majority remainder from the coupon.
While loans underperformed high yield by about 200bp 5.3% vs. 7.4%, they significantly outperformed 10-Year Treasuries -7.8% and Investment Grade Credit -1.5%.
The European market also performed well with the S&P European Leveraged Loan Index ELLI returning 8.59% for the year.
Over half of this, 4.41%, was generated from price with the remainder from coupon, which does reflect the quality composition of the two respective markets in that the weighted average bid on the ELLI was 95 in the final reading of the year whereas in the U. S. it was over 98.
European high yield securities also outperformed their U. S. counterpart in 2013 with the Merrill Lynch European High Yield Index returning 10.13% for the year with less of a reaction seen to Chairman Bernankes comments in May regarding the potential introduction of tapering by the U. S. Federal Reserve.
Demand for loans was very strong from both retail funds $70bn and collateralised loan obligations CLOs $82bn and this helped drive over $450bn of issuance during the year.
While most of this issuance was refinancing related, we did see new money in the market from leveraged buy-outs LBOs, mergers and acquisitions and recapitalisations.
These new money deals resulted in an over $100bn increase in the size of the U. S. loan market, from $575bn to $682bn.
Spreads were under pressure all year as excess demand drove the refinancing activity mentioned above.
In all, issuers shaved approximately 115bp on $281bn of loans or approximately 42% off the FYE 2012 Loan Index.
Additionally, a significant portion of the issuance in 2013 was covenant lite loans 57% of the total and these loans now represent 46% of the U. S. loan market.
In Europe, we saw robust new issuance levels of 65bn, a significant improvement on 2012s 29bn and, additionally, we saw record high yield bond issuance of 70bn, of which 32bn was senior secured.
To date covenant lite loan issuance has been relatively limited in Europe but we do anticipate the market to follow the lead of the U. S. during 2014, particularly as demand for the loan asset class increases, driven by strong institutional demand and the re-awakening of the CLO market.
In 2013 we saw 7.4bn of issuance in a market that had been basically closed since 2008.
Defaults picked up slightly throughout the year, from 1.27% to 2.11% by volume and from 1.36% to 1.61% by issuer count.
In all, 11 issuers defaulted on $11.4bn of paper compared with 9 on $6.4bn in 2012.
Approximately two thirds of the 2013 defaults came from five issuers, being four yellow pages companies and one textbook publisher, and all were well telegraphed by the trading price of the respective loans prior to default.
European defaults came in lower than we forecasted at 2.9% by volume, the lowest reading since June 2011, and 4.9% by issuer count which indicates defaults are generally being experienced in the mid-market space that we avoid.
Portfolio The portfolio remains fully invested and continues to take advantage of global opportunities.
As at 31 December 2013, 88.14% of the Companys portfolio was invested in U. S. Dollar denominated assets excluding cash with the remaining 11.85% of the portfolio invested in Euro and Sterling denominated assets.
The Companys exposure to non-U.
S. assets has increased from 4.55% as at 31 December 2012 as the macro environment slowly improved in Europe and better issuance was seen.
You will note that within the statement of operations under Net realised gain on derivatives and Net change in unrealised appreciation on derivatives that there are gains of $41,119,080 and $42,127,799 respectively on these positions.
We would like to highlight that this is as a result of share class hedging and is not as a result of investments held within the portfolio.
The Company maintains forward foreign exchange transactions in order to hedge against the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Companys NAV.
The main purposes of hedging the financial instruments are i to mitigate the effect of foreign exchange movements on the value of non U. S. Dollar denominated investments by the Company and ii to mitigate the effect of foreign exchange movements on the Sterling value of shareholders investments in the Sterling share class.
ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2013 5 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 ANNUAL REPORT INVESTMENT MANAGERS REPORT CONTINUED Market Outlook We believe that the fundamentals for investing in the loan asset class remain favourable.
Default rates are expected to remain low in both the United States and Europe with forecasts of below 2% and 2 - 4%, respectively.
This is driven by the lack of near term maturities only US$17 billion of institutional loans come due in 2014 and 2015, approximately 2.6% of the U. S. Loan Index and a relatively small portion of the market that we consider high risk.
The highest risk deals seen during the most recent cycle had leverage of over 7x and interest coverage of less than 1.5x cumulative defaults for such loans were approximately 13% as opposed to just over 4% for deals with 4x leverage or less.
In contrast, there have been very few such deals done in recent years and none in 2013.
Additionally, we are satisfied with the performance of the issuers in the portfolio.
As at 31 December 2013, their average total and secured debt to cash flow was an acceptable 5.6x and 3.9x, respectively.
Furthermore, cash flow to interest expense was a robust 3.5x.
At these leverage levels we remain comfortable that the issuers can generate free cash flow and continue to fide-lever and this ability remains critical as we look to add new names to the portfolio.
The average bid of the U. S. Loan Index ended the year at 98.29, which increases to 100.05 if all issuers rated below Bare removed.
As such, we believe price gains for 2014 will primarily be limited to CCC and D rated issuers, which make up only 8% of the U. S. Loan Index.
Therefore performance is likely to be driven primarily by coupon returns and the most likely downside risk is an exogenous shock that leads to a risk-off environment which causes outflows from the asset class.
