easyJet has number 1 or number 2 positions in 21 of the top 100 airports across Europe including London Gatwick, Geneva, Milan Malpensa, Paris Charles fide Gaulle, Paris Orly and Berlin Schnefeld.
One example of how easyJet has built a strong network position in an attractive market is Geneva where the base was opened in 1999. easyJets capacity at Geneva has increased from 4 million seats in 2006 to around 7 million in 2013 and it is the number 1 airline at the airport with around a 40% market share.
easyJet now has 13 aircraft based in Geneva and operates 59 routes from the airport.
Geneva is a particularly attractive market for easyJet as it is an important centre for business with many leading multinational companies and organisations in the area.

com 21 Strategic report Our strategy in action continued MAINTAIN COST ADVANTAGE 7%-8% cost per seat savings between a current generation A319 and a current generation A320 aircraft easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2013 22 Strategic report FLEET ORDER Maintaining the cost advantage is another key pillar of easyJets strategy.
Since 2003 easyJet has benefitted from a framework agreement with Airbus which has enabled the Company to take delivery of aircraft at very significant discounts to the list price.
4%-5% New technology has become available in the short-haul market, primarily in the form of new engines, so easyJet further cost per seat undertook a highly competitive, rigorous and thorough savings between a current fleet selection process to secure its fleet arrangements generation A320 and to 2022.
The process included a detailed evaluation of a new generation the technical and financial benets of placing an aircraft order which were subject to the highest standards of A320neo aircraft governance, control and ethical behaviour.
In July 2013, easyJets shareholders approved a new framework agreement with Airbus which secures the delivery of aircraft until 2022 and will help easyJet maintain its cost advantage through use of a more fuel efficient fleet of aircraft.
The new framework arrangements with Airbus are for 35 current generation A320 aircraft for delivery between 2015 and 2017 under its existing agreement with Airbus and 100 new generation A320neo aircraft for delivery from 2017 until 2022, under a new agreement.
Under this new agreement, Airbus also granted easyJet the right to acquire up to 100 further new generation A320neo family aircraft.
The new fleet arrangements contain a significant amount of exibility giving easyJet the ability to reduce the fleet size to 171 by 2022 or increase it to 298 depending on the external environment.
The new generation aircraft were sourced at highly attractive prices and at a greater percentage discount to list price than easyJets previous contract with Airbus.
The new framework arrangements continue the current policy of operating a common fleet type and secure easyJets supply of aircraft.
Importantly, although this transaction represents a substantial financial commitment, it is expected to be nanced through a combination of easyJets internal resources, cashow, sale and leaseback transaction and debt.
In recent years easyJet has been improving its cost per seat advantage by increasing the number of 180 seat A320 aircraft in the fleet and reducing the number of 156 seat A319 aircraft.
This improves its cost per seat advantage through economies of scale, efficiencies in crew, ownership, fuel and maintenance.
Up-gauging from a current generation 156 seat A319 aircraft to a current generation A320 aircraft gives a cost per seat saving of 7% to 8%.
By moving from a current generation 180 seat A320 aircraft to a 180 seat new generation A320neo aircraft, easyJet is able to secure a further 4% to 5% cost per seat saving.
The new fleet arrangements will help easyJet maintain its cost advantage, which is one of the critical factors in its future success and will enable easyJet to continue its successful strategy of offering customers low fares to convenient airports and efficient and friendly service.

Now that allocated seating has been rolled out across the whole network, all passengers are allocated a seat on easyJets ights and have the choice of selecting their seat for a fee when they book ights or adding them later to guarantee where they sit.
There are currently three bands of pricing, dependent on the seat selected.
