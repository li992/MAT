We will build a new tailings dam, the third, in 2014 to support increased operating levels.

com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Strategy Performance Adjusted Adjusted revenue Adjusted production costs Key developments in 2013 US$ US$ revenue US$ Annual gold production decreased 10.6% from 2012 due to the expected depletion of high ore grade bodies.
This was 250.7 million 88.0 million 250.7 m partially mitigated by increased volumes of ore throughput resulting from the optimisation of the milling process, which 21.7% increased capacity from 2,800 to 3,600 tpd, and slightly improved recovery rates.
Silver production increased by a strong 27.4% due to increased ore throughput from San Ramn, which has higher silver mineralisation and lower gold grades.
San Ramn represented 34% of Cinegas total throughput.
Gold 58.7%Contractor 41.2% Lead and zinc production fell as a result of lower grades.
Silver 34.4% Operating materials 18.8% Lead 3.3% Personnel 13.6% As expected, average gold ore grade decreased in the year, Zinc 3.6%Electricity 9.6% from 3.6 g t in 2012 to 2.9 g t -19.4%.
Conversely, silver ore Diesel 1.1% grade rose 15.6% to 121.6 g t reecting the increased Maintenance 8.1% contribution from the San Ramn satellite.
Gold grades are Others 7.6% expected to continue decreasing towards the level contained in resources with an expected ore grade between 2.0 g t and Social and sustainability highlights 2.5 g t for 2014, whilst silver grade is anticipated to remain above 100 g t in the coming years, further strengthening the Health silver prole of this mine.
Due to the mines geographical location, we have an Silver reserves were replenished, whilst gold reserves agreement with the Mexican Social Security Institute IMSS decreased by 2.3% with the depletion of gold ore bodies to assume general healthcare services for the community.

We optimised electricity consumption to reduce mine work, optimisation of the milling process, construction usage during periods of peak demand on the national grid.

to expanding milling capacity to 5,000 tpd and construction of the third tailings dam.
Community relations We sponsored a local festival and continued our permanent Financial performance campaign of garbage collections.
Adjusted revenue decreased 21.7% to US$250.7 million in 2013, reecting lower sales volume in gold and the lower prices of gold and silver.
Cinega is the Groups most polymetallic mine, as evidenced by the 41.3% contribution from silver, lead and zinc 2012: 36.9%.
Productivity increased in the year due to optimisation of the Primary crushing milling process.
Cost per tonne milled at Cinega decreased at Cinega 8.1% to US$70.8 reecting the positive impact of the 11.6% increase in ore milled and other efficiencies achieved, such as optimised shotcreting, lower consumption of anchors, reduced unit consumption of electricity resulting from the optimised milling process, and reduction in diesel consumption due to shorter haulage distances from upper levels of the mine, as well as lower medical expenses.
These benets were offset by an estimated cost ination of 5.4%.
Cash cost per gold ounce increased to US$37.7.
Margin per ounce was US$1,363.6, whilst expressed as a percentage of gold prices the margin was 97.3%.
