Non-IFRS measures Although we prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, we also report and discuss additional measures that we call underlying.
These underlying measures are not IFRS measures.
Management believes that these underlying measures provide investors with useful information regarding our ongoing performance by excluding certain amounts that are included in the comparable IFRS numbers.
You can find a description of these underlying measures and their limitations, an explanation of why management believes they are useful to investors and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure on pages 150 to 153.

For a more detailed explanation of movements please see the in-depth analysis on pages 22 to 26.
This was mainly due to: A decrease in Legacy revenue during 2013 we experienced an expected fall in sales across all Legacy products, but in particular the revenue from sales of handset connectivity and handset location products, which transferred to Legacy in 2012 following the disposal of related development operations to Samsung the Samsung Transaction which is more fully described on page 22.
Lower Camera sales volumes during 2013 we saw a significant decline in sales volumes of digital still camera products reflecting a broader shift in the market from point-and-shoot models to smartphones and tablets.
This is reported in our Consumer segment.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from the Voice & Music and Auto segments, 64% and 8% respectively, due to increased sales volumes of higher priced products.

indb 20 11 03 2014 21:17 CSR in review Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Our IFRS gross margins increased to 51.6% in 2013 2012 49.6% primarily due to a shift in product mix away from lower margin handset products, combined with the strong growth in the higher margin Voice & Music business.
underlying gross margin increased to 52.4% for the same reasons 2012 50.8%.
Total operational costs comprise Research & Development R&D expenses and Sales, General & Administration SG&A expenses and fell by 12% to $466.8 million in 2013, compared to $528.4 million in 2012.
This reduction in costs was primarily driven by a reduction in underlying operational costs, a $10.9 million reduction in litigation costs and the release of a $9.8 million litigation provision.
This was offset by a $10.4 million increase in share based payment costs, driven by the increase in share price and the higher volume of shares issued to employees.
underlying operational costs fell by 11% to $399.1 million in 2013, compared to $446.5 million in 2012.
This was mainly due to the full year benefit of lower headcount following restructuring programmes which completed in 2012 that included the transfer of 311 employees as part of the Samsung Transaction.
The total operating loss for 2013 was $48.4 million after the impact of the non-cash $76.9 million impairment on ceasing to develop further camera products, and other non-underlying items.
underlying operating profit grew to $104.3 million in 2013 2012 $74.0 million due to the strong underlying gross margin and lower operational costs as mentioned above.
Cameras On 10 December 2013, we announced our decision to cease development of future cameraon-a-chip COACH platform products, in order to focus investment on higher growth markets.
This decision resulted in a non-cash $76.9 million impairment to the goodwill, intangible assets and tangible assets allocated to the Cameras cash generating unit CGu.
This charge comprised $50.5 million impairment on goodwill, $26.2 million on intangible assets and $0.2 million on tangible assets.
In connection with this decision, during 2013, we also incurred restructuring costs of $6.5 million which were mainly due to the planned redundancies for 152 staff in the Camera business who were not redeployed to other business activities.
These employees are expected to leave during 2014.
We anticipate that further costs relating to this decision will arise during 2014.
Returns to Shareholders During the 2013 financial year CSR bought back 8.45 million of its own ordinary shares in the open market for an aggregate of $67.8 million, the details of which are disclosed on page 85.
As at 27 December 2013, $7.2 million remained outstanding from the most recent buy back, which commenced in September 2013.
In addition during 2013, the Employee Benefit Trust purchased 0.5 million shares for an aggregate of $4.8 million.
In respect of the 2013 financial year, the Company paid an interim dividend of $0.045 per ordinary share in September 2013 and the Board is recommending a final dividend for 2013 of $0.091 per ordinary share.
The total dividend for 2013 is therefore $0.136, an increase of 15% over the total dividend relating to 2012.
Subject to shareholder approval the final dividend is expected to be paid in May 2014 to shareholders on record as of 9 May 2014.
Litigation During 2013 we paid $12.0 million to settle outstanding lawsuits of which $7.5 million had been accrued in 2012.
In March 2013 the uS Supreme Court dismissed the case brought by the uS Securities and Exchange Commission against two former officers of Microtune, Inc. in respect of which CSR assumed certain indemnification obligations as a result of the acquisition of Zoran Corporation in 2011.
As a consequence of the courts decision, we released a litigation provision of $9.8 million.
For further details of on-going litigation affecting CSR see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.
