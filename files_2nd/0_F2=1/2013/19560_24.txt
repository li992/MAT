Investment Mandates Cordea Savills revenue increased by 11% to 26.0m 2012: 23.5m.
AUM increased by 17% to 4.2bn 2012: 3.6bn through the combination of new segregated mandates, investment performance and inflows into existing funds.
The Prime London Residential Development Fund successfully completed a number of development funding transactions and substantial investment capacity was deployed both through increases in existing mandates and new advisory appointments.
In the summer, Cordea Savills entered an agreement to purchase Merchant Capital KK in Japan.
Completion is expected to occur in Q2 2014 and the acquisition gave rise to costs of 0.3m which were charged in 2013.
These, together with certain UK-related restructuring costs, temporarily reduced the underlying profit margin to 11.2% 2012: 15.3% reducing underlying profits by 19% to 2.9m 2012: 3.6m.
Having completed a year of change and operational development, Cordea Savills is well positioned to grow its business and entered 2014 with new investment capacity of over 500m.
Summary Overall in 2013, Savills delivered a strong performance helped by a strengthening of the UK economy and Central London retaining its status as the number one destination for worldwide real estate investor demand.
Our leading market shares in both the prime residential and commercial markets enabled us to benefit from improvements in the UK market as a whole.
In Asia the breadth of our business ensured that we successfully withstood the current decline in activity in Hong Kong through the considerably improved performance of our businesses in the major markets of China, Japan and Australia.
Our Continental European business delivered its target of a material reduction in losses, despite incurring significant reorganisation and expansion costs and our Cordea Savills Investment Management business continued to grow its AUM, with further expansion in the pipeline for 2014.
Whilst the Transactional Advisory business provided the majority of our profit improvement, our strong Property Management and Consultancy businesses continued to provide a solid foundation and support for this performance.
We entered 2014 with confidence and a continued focus on improving the breadth and depth of our services across the globe to our increasingly multi-national client base.
