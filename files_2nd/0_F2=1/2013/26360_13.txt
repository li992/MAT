Summary of Group results 45 Lloyds Banking Group Divisional results 56 45 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Other financial information 66 Five year financial summary 68 1 69 123 197 377 SuMMARY OF GROuP ReSulTS Overview In 2013, we significantly improved the Groups profitability and further strengthened our capital position, while improving margins, and reducing costs and non-core assets as we simplified and fide-risked the business.
Income grew as funding costs fell, core lending increased and we benefited from gains on the sales of shares in St. Jamess Place.
This growth in income, combined with lower operating costs and impairments resulted in an increase in core underlying profits to 7.6 billion.
The Group also returned its lending to core corporate customers to growth in the first half of 2013, and to mortgage customers in the second half, while non-core asset reductions continued to be capital accretive overall, with underlying losses from the non-core portfolio declined significantly.
Significantly improved Group underlying and statutory profitability Group underlying profit more than doubled, increasing by 3,601 million to 6,166 million compared to 2012.
The return on risk-weighted assets improved to 2.14 per cent from 0.77 per cent, driven by increased earnings and by risk-weighted asset reductions, predominantly in the non-core business.
Core underlying profit before tax grew 24 per cent to 7,574 million, primarily reflecting reduced impairment charges and stronger net interest income.
underlying income grew by 2 per cent to 18,805 million, including the gain of 540 million from the sales of shares in St. Jamess Place.
excluding the gain on sales and income from St. Jamess Place together St. Jamess Place effects, total underlying income was unchanged with a stronger contribution from net interest income offsetting a reduction in other income.
Group net interest income improved by 5 per cent to 10,885 million as a result of improved net interest margin and growth in core lending volumes.
Other income decreased by 6 per cent excluding St. Jamess Place effects, primarily as a result of non-core disposals made during the course of the year.
We maintained our focus on cost control and efficiency, with total costs falling by 5 per cent to 9,635 million, in line with the upgraded guidance given in the first quarter of 2013.
The impairment charge improved by 47 per cent to 3,004 million, driven by the reduction in non-core assets and the sustained improvement in Group asset quality.
Core underlying profit improved to 7,574 million from 6,112 million and the return on risk-weighted assets increased to 3.26 per cent from 2.54 per cent.
excluding St. Jamess Place effects, the return on risk-weighted assets was 3.00 per cent.
Core underlying income increased 6 per cent to 18,244 million, and by 4 per cent excluding St. Jamess Place effects given improved net interest income from core loan growth and higher margins.
The core net interest margin increased by 17 basis points to 2.49 per cent, driven mainly by improved deposit margins.
Core other income increased 3 per cent to 7,606 million but excluding St. Jamess Place effects was down 2 per cent reflecting current economic conditions and the regulatory environment.
Core costs decreased by 1 per cent, driven by further savings from the Simplification programme and the deconsolidation of St. Jamess Place, partially offset by additional staff related costs and inflation.
The core impairment charge decreased 21 per cent to 1,521 million with the reduction primarily attributable to Commercial Banking impairments, which reduced by 40 per cent year-on-year reflecting better quality new business and lower defaults due to the low interest rate environment.
non-core losses reduced by 60 per cent to 1,408 million year-on-year, largely as a result of the reduction in non-core assets which was also the primary driver of the 61 per cent reduction in the impairment charge to 1,483 million.
The Group statutory profit before tax of 415 million for 2013 compared to a pre-tax loss of 606 million in 2012, driven by the improvement in underlying profit and a lower provision for legacy issues of 3,455 million compared to the 4,225 million charge in 2012.
In 2013 the Group was subject to a higher effective tax rate than the uK statutory rate primarily due to an additional tax charge arising from the impacts on the net deferred tax asset of the reduction in the uK Corporation tax rate, the disposal of our Australian operation and policyholder tax.
The loss after tax was 802 million and the loss per share was 1.2p, compared to the loss per share of 2.1p in 2012.
Lower risk, stronger balance sheet with core loan growth and a substantially enhanced capital position We have now substantially completed our work to transform the balance sheet, by strengthening our funding, liquidity and capital position, and reducing non-core assets, and we returned core corporate and mortgage lending to growth in 2013.
We reduced non-core assets by 34.9 billion to 63.5 billion during the year, with non-retail non-core assets reduced to 24.7 billion.
non-core asset reductions continue to be capital accretive overall and, together with core underlying profit generation and management actions, resulted in a considerable strengthening of our capital ratios.
The Groups pro forma fully loaded CRD IV common equity tier 1 ratio improved to 10.3 per cent from 8.1 per cent at 31 December 2012, in spite of the additional legacy charges, changes to pension accounting following the implementation of IAS 19R and other statutory items.
Core loans and advances grew by 11.6 billion or 3 per cent to 436.9 billion, primarily driven by increases in Commercial Banking and Wealth, Asset Finance and International.
We also returned Retail secured lending to growth, as expected in the third quarter and delivered 1.9 billion of further loan growth in our core book in the fourth quarter.

The growth in core income more than offset the decline in non-core income which resulted from the continued reduction of non-core assets.
net interest income excluding St. Jamess Place effects increased by 5 per cent to 10,884 million in 2013, and grew for the fourth successive quarter.
The growth reflected increased core lending and the improved net interest margin, partly offset by reduced net interest income from the smaller non-core asset portfolio.
The improvement in Group net interest margin to 2.12 per cent for the full year, and to 2.29 per cent in the fourth quarter, was principally driven by a strong performance in deposit margin, which more than offset a small decline in asset margin and an 8 basis points reduction from repositioning our government bond portfolio.
The net interest margin also benefited, relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, from the effect of repositioning our structural hedge.
This repositioning is now largely complete and provides the Group with a greater level of protection from changes in net interest income from movements in interest rates.
Core net interest income increased 8 per cent principally as a result of the significant improvement in margin.
Other income excluding St. Jamess Place fell by 6 per cent to 7,259 million, reflecting the significant reduction in non-core assets and lower sales of bancassurance and protection products in the core business, partly as a result of changes in our product offering following implementation of the Retail Distribution Review RDR.
Around 400 million of the decline in other income excluding St. Jamess Place related to businesses sold in the year.

Total costs include a bank levy charge of 238 million 2012: 179 million.
We continue to expect costs in 2014 to reduce to around 9 billion, excluding TSB running costs.
Core costs fell 1 per cent to 9,149 million driven by strong cost management, benefits from the Simplification programme and the deconsolidation of St. Jamess Place from the beginning of April.
These reductions were partly offset by additional staff related costs, inflation and the increase in the bank levy.
non-core costs fell 44 per cent due to the significant reduction in non-core assets.
The Group continues to make good progress on Simplification, improving service for customers through more streamlined end-to-end processes, and, among other initiatives, centralising support functions, reducing layers of management and rationalising its supplier base.
We continue to reinvest a part of these savings in the core business.
At 31 December 2013, we had achieved annual run-rate cost savings of 1,457 million from our initiatives to simplify the Group, an increase of 610 million since 31 December 2012.
We have now increased our expectations for annual run-rate cost savings from the Simplification programme at the end of 2014 from 1.9 billion to 2.0 billion.

The asset quality ratio improved by 45 basis points to 0.57 per cent, and is now within the target range for the Group set out in our Strategic Review of 50 to 60 basis points.
The core asset quality ratio remains low at 0.35 per cent.
The 21 per cent decrease in the core impairment charge to 1,521 million was primarily driven by lower impairment in Commercial Banking, which was down 40 per cent compared to 2012 given the improvement in the economic environment together with higher releases in 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.
The significant improvement in the non-core impairment charge of 61 per cent compared to 2012 reflected reductions in the Corporate Real estate and Irish portfolios following asset disposals.
Impaired loans as a percentage of closing advances reduced substantially to 6.3 per cent, from 8.6 per cent at 31 December 2012, driven by the reduced non-core portfolio and improvements in both the Retail and Commercial Banking portfolios.
Provisions as a percentage of impaired loans increased from 48.2 per cent at 31 December 2012 to 50.1 per cent.

Asset sales, liability management and volatile items Asset sales included gains on the sale of government securities of 787 million 2012: 3,207 million and a net loss of 687 million after a related fair value unwind benefit of 1,384 million, principally from the significant reduction in non-core assets.
Despite net losses in the year, non-core disposals were capital accretive in aggregate contributing to the 2.6 billion of capital generated by non-core reduction.
The level of net losses from asset sales incurred in 2013 is not expected to be repeated in 2014.
The Groups statutory profit before tax is affected by insurance volatility caused by movements in financial markets generating a variance against expected returns, and policyholder interests volatility which primarily reflects the gross up of policyholder tax included in the Group tax charge.
The statutory result included 668 million of positive insurance and policyholder interests volatility 2012: positive volatility of 312 million, reflecting the rise in equity markets in the period.
Summary of Group results 45 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Divisional results 56 48 49 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Other financial information 66 Five year financial summary 68 1 69 123 197 377 Simplification and Verde costs Simplification programme costs in 2013 were 830 million and the total spent on the programme to the end of 2013 was 1,691 million.
This had delivered annual run-rate cost savings of 1,457 million by December 2013.
Our expectations for annual run-rate cost savings by the end of 2014 have now increased from 1.9 billion to 2.0 billion.
We now expect the total costs to be around 2.5 billion by the end of 2014, of which 2.4 billion is anticipated to be directly expensed through the profit and loss account.
The Group continues to progress the european Commission eC mandated business disposal Verde, with an Initial Public Offering IPO planned for 2014.
Subject to meeting a number of criteria, this plan has been agreed in principle by the eC but remains subject to final regulatory and eC approval.
The Project Verde branches were rebranded in September 2013, and now operate as TSB as a separate business within the lloyds Banking Group.
The costs of building TSB were 687 million in the year and, from inception to the end of December 2013, have totalled 1,468 million.
We expect to complete the build of TSB at a cost in 2014 of around 200 million with further dual running and transaction costs of around 150 million.
PPI The Group made a further provision in the fourth quarter for expected PPI costs of 1,800 million, which brought the amount provided in 2013 for PPI to 3,050 million, and the total amount provided to 9,825 million.
Total costs incurred in the three months to 31 December 2013 were 687 million, including 165 million of administration costs, and as at 31 December 2013, 2,807 million of the total provision remained unutilised.
The volume of PPI complaints continues to fall.
Average monthly complaint volumes excluding complaints where no PPI was held reduced to approximately 37,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013, and were 24 per cent below volumes in the third quarter, and 56 per cent below the fourth quarter of 2012.
While fourth quarter volumes fell in line with our revised end of third quarter expectations, following further statistical modelling and the results of the most recent customer survey, we are now forecasting a slower decline in future volumes than previously expected.
The additional provision taken in the fourth quarter is based on the assumption that we will receive approximately a further 550,000 complaints.
Together with an increase in administrative costs, this revised forecast for future complaint volumes accounts for approximately 1.1 billion of the 1.8 billion additional provision taken in the fourth quarter.
A revision of our forecasts for uphold rates and response rates to proactive mailings together account for approximately 0.4 billion of the increased provision, and reflect forecast rates above our recent experience.
The Group has also increased its estimates for remediation costs, which principally relate to the re-review of previously defended complaints, and this accounts for approximately 0.3 billion of the increased provision.
Since the commencement of the PPI redress programme in 2011 we estimate we have contacted, settled or provided for approximately 40 per cent of the policies sold since 2000, covering both customer-initiated complaints and actual and expected proactive mailings undertaken by the Group.
The proactive mailings arise from a detailed Past Business Review, carried out by the Group as agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, as a result of which the Group is contacting customers identified as having the highest likelihood of required redress.
These mailings are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first half of 2014.
In terms of customer-initiated complaints, the fourth quarter monthly average run-rate of approximately 37,000 complaints is around 70 per cent below its peak and complaints have declined in each of the last six quarters.
The total amount provided for PPI represents our best estimate of the likely future costs, albeit a number of risks and uncertainties remain, in particular complaint volumes, uphold rates, average redress costs, the scope and cost of proactive mailings and remediation, and the outcome of the FCA enforcement Team investigation.
The cost of these factors could differ materially from our estimates, with the risk that a further provision could be required.
Other provisions A further provision of 130 million was made in the fourth quarter relating to the sale of interest rate hedging products to certain small and medium-sized businesses.
This brings the amount provided to 530 million, of which 218 million relates to administration costs.
As at 31 December 2013, 368 million of the total provision remained unutilised.
In the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other uK and overseas regulators and governmental authorities in relation to a range of matters: a provision is held against the costs expected to be incurred.
In 2013 these provisions were increased by a further 200 million, in respect of matters affecting the Retail, Commercial and Wealth and Asset Finance businesses, bringing the total amount to 300 million, of which 75 million had been utilised at 31 December 2013.
This includes a fine of 28 million from the FCA following an investigation into its historic systems and controls governing legacy incentive schemes for branch advisors.
Other provisions also included an additional 75 million recognised in the first half of 2013 for claims relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Insurance Group limited in Germany, bringing the total provision to 400 million, of which 246 million remains unutilised at 31 December 2013.
Other items The Group recognised a charge for other statutory items of 499 million in the period, compared to a charge of 232 million in 2012.
This comprises a charge for the amortisation of intangible assets of 395 million, and a charge of 104 million as a result of changes to early retirement and commutation factors in two of the Groups principal defined benefit schemes 2012: 250 million gain related to a change in policy in respect of discretionary pension increases.
Taxation The tax charge for 2013 was 1,217 million.
This reflected a higher effective tax rate than the uK statutory rate primarily due to an additional tax charge arising from the impact on the net deferred tax asset of the reductions in uK corporation tax rate to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014 and 20 per cent from 1 April 2015: the write-down of a deferred tax asset in respect of Australian trading losses following the sale of our Australian operations: and policyholder taxes.
We expect the effective tax rate in future periods will be in the range of 20-25 per cent, subject to policyholder tax and any possible effect from disposals such as Verde.

3 Includes the full value of tier 1 instruments reported under the prevailing rules as at 31 December 2013.
4 estimated in accordance with January 2014 revised Basel III leverage ratio framework.
We have significantly strengthened the Groups capital ratios in the year.
The Groups pro forma fully loaded common equity tier 1 CeT1 ratio has increased to 10.3 per cent from 8.1 per cent at 31 December 2012.
The improvement was driven by capital generation in the core business, the decrease in risk-weighted assets from non-core asset reductions, improving economic conditions and a number of management actions.
These management actions included the disposal of St. Jamess Place, the announced disposals of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership and Heidelberger leben, the sale of a uS residential mortgage-backed security RMBS portfolio and a number of overseas businesses as well as dividends of 2.2 billion from the Insurance business to the Group.
This improvement in the capital ratio was partially offset by charges for legacy items, losses on disposal of non-core assets, and other statutory items including the effects of changes to pension accounting and the costs of Simplification and Verde.
The Groups total capital ratio under prevailing rules improved to 20.8 per cent, with 25.4 billion of tier 1 and tier 2 securities contributing to the 54.8 billion capital base.
The Groups pro forma fully loaded CRD IV leverage ratio, including tier 1 capital, increased to 4.1 per cent from 3.8 per cent at the end of 2012 and to 3.4 per cent from 3.1 per cent excluding tier 1 capital.
In January 2014 the Basel Committee published a revised Basel III definition of leverage ratio, and we anticipate that CRD IV will be amended in due course to align with this definition.
As at 31 December 2013 the Groups pro forma Basel III leverage ratio was 4.5 per cent including tier 1 capital, and 3.8 per cent excluding tier 1 capital.
Given its improved capital strength the Group will no longer seek to fund the payment of coupons on certain hybrid capital securities through the issuance of equity.
In addition, the PRA has now confirmed that it will consider the Groups application to make dividend payments in line with its normal procedures for other banks.
In arriving at this assessment, the PRA considered the Groups financial plans including any actions contained therein.
The PRAs assessment was made in the context of previous announcements as to uK regulatory capital targets and expectations, including the PRAs news release on capital standards issued on 29 november 2013.
Subject to a return to sustainable profitability and there being no major unexpected changes in the Groups business outlook or regulatory requirements, the Board expects that it will apply to the PRA in the second half of 2014 to restart dividend payments.

During 2013, lending to core customers increased by 11.6 billion to 436.9 billion with all banking divisions returning to growth.
Customer deposits grew by 15.8 billion to 438.3 billion, with the core loan to deposit ratio improving to 100 per cent.
The Group loan to deposit ratio also improved, falling to 113 per cent, reflecting the reduction in the non-core asset portfolio and associated wholesale funding.
non-core assets were 63.5 billion at December 2013, 35 per cent lower than at the end of 2012. non-core asset reductions included 6.6 billion in Australia as well as 6.7 billion in uK commercial real estate and 2.7 billion in the shipping portfolio.
The higher risk non-retail element of the portfolio reduced by 23.8 billion, or 49 per cent, in the year to 24.7 billion, and is expected to reduce to around 15 billion by the end of 2014.
The average risk weighting of the non-core portfolio reduced from 74 per cent to 61 per cent.
non-core asset reductions continue to be capital accretive overall, releasing approximately 2.6 billion of capital in the year.
The non-core portfolio now poses substantially less risk to the Group.
As a result, approximately 31 billion of retail non-core assets including our uK and Dutch mortgage portfolios and the majority of the uK Asset Finance business will be reabsorbed into the core business, with the remaining non-core assets managed in a separate run-off unit.
We will no longer report on a core non-core basis in 2014, but will continue to report separately on those assets that remain in run-off.
The Groups wholesale funding requirement has reduced given the reduction in non-core assets and continued growth in customer deposits in the year.
Together these have enabled us to reduce wholesale funding by 32 billion and, as reported at the half year, repay the full amount of the long Term Refinancing Operation funding from the european Central Bank of A13.5 billion ahead of schedule.
The Group has so far committed over 37 billion of gross new lending to British customers under the Funding for lending Scheme FlS with drawings under the scheme amounting to 8 billion as at the end of 2013.
The Group will continue to have a modest wholesale funding requirement and we anticipate that in 2014 this will be in the range of 5-10 billion of public issuance, while the Groups aggregate usage of wholesale funding is expected to further reduce in 2014.
The Groups liquidity position remains strong, with primary liquid assets of 89.3 billion at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012: 87.6 billion.
Primary liquid assets represent approximately 4.2 times our money-market funding with a maturity of less than one year, and are approximately 2.0 times our short-term wholesale funding, providing a substantial buffer in the event of market dislocation.
In addition to primary liquid assets, the Group has significant secondary liquidity holdings of 105.4 billion 31 December 2012: 117.1 billion.
Total liquid assets represent approximately 4.4 times our wholesale funding with a maturity of less than one year.
The liquidity Coverage Ratio lCR is expected to become the Pillar 1 standard for liquidity in the uK in 2015, and the PRA has the ability to impose firm-specific liquidity requirements.
The european Commission is to adopt further legislation by 30 June 2014 to specify the definition, calibration, calculation, and phase-in of the lCR for implementation in 2015.
The Group expects to meet the new requirements ahead of the implementation dates.
The significant reduction of non-core assets and the balance sheet strengthening undertaken in the year supports the Group in becoming a lower risk bank with a stronger and more sustainable earnings outlook.
Conclusion The Group has delivered improvements in underlying profits and core returns with growth in core lending, underlying income and net interest margin, and further reductions in costs and impairments.
The continued progress in reducing balance sheet risk and the strengthening of the Groups capital ratios leaves us well positioned to continue growing our core business as we support the uK economic recovery.

Underlying basis In order to present a more meaningful view of business performance, the results of the Group and divisions are presented on an underlying basis.
The key principles adopted in the preparation of the underlying basis of reporting are described below.
In order to reflect the impact of the acquisition of HBOS, the amortisation of purchased intangible assets and the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments have been excluded.
The following items, not related to acquisition accounting, have also been excluded from underlying profit: the effects of certain asset sales, liability management and volatile items: volatility arising in insurance businesses: Simplification costs: Verde costs: payment protection insurance provision: insurance gross up: certain past service pensions items in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes: and other regulatory provisions.
The financial statements have been restated following the implementation of IAS 19R employee Benefits and IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements with effect from 1 January 2013.
To enable a better understanding of the Groups core business trends and outlook, certain income statement, balance sheet and regulatory capital information is analysed between core and non-core portfolios.
The non-core portfolios consist of businesses which deliver below-hurdle returns, which are outside the Groups risk appetite or may be distressed, are subscale or have an unclear value proposition, or have a poor fit with the Groups customer strategy.
The eC mandated retail business disposal Project Verde is included in core portfolios.
