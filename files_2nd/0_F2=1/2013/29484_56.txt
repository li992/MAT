The performance metrics and performance against them will be disclosed in the 2014 Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
The team element of the 2014 annual bonus will be assessed by reference to key strategic targets based around the 2014 business plan, including elements relating to clients, shareholders and other key stakeholders.
