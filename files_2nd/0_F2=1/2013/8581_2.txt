com Stock code: ITV Business Model How ITV generates value As an integrated producer broadcaster, we have a unique opportunity to deliver value from our investment in quality content.
Our investment in our programme budget for our broadcast channels delivers unrivalled audiences that drive our advertising revenues.
Our channels also provide a shop window for our own content to make it famous before selling it internationally.
By creating and owning content we can grow new revenue streams by exploiting that content across multiple platforms, both free and pay.
Investment in our creative pipeline and in selective acquisitions is building our international content business as we sell our programmes and formats internationally as the demand for proven content continues to grow.
