"COMPANY OVERVIEW The investment objective of NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Limited the ""Company"" is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends, at levels that are sustainable, whilst preserving the capital value of its investment portfolio, utilising the investment skills of Neuberger Berman Europe Limited the ""Investment Manager"" and Neuberger Berman Fixed Income LLC the ""SubInvestment Manager""."
To pursue its investment objective, the Company invests mainly in floating rate senior secured loans issued in U. S. Dollars, Sterling and Euros by primarily North American and European Union corporations, partnerships and other business issuers.
These loans are at the time of investment often non-investment grade.
The Company considers debt instruments to be non-investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories Aaa, Aa, A and Baa by at least two independent credit ratings agencies or, if unrated, are deemed by the Investment Manager to be of comparable quality.
For the purposes of efficient portfolio management, the Company has established a wholly-owned Luxembourg incorporated subsidiary, NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 1 S.. r. l. which in turn holds a wholly-owned subsidiary, NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Lux 2 S.. r. l. All references to the Company in this document refer to the Company together with its wholly owned Luxembourg subsidiaries.
"Non - Mainstream Pooled Investments Suitability for Retail Distribution The Board notes the changes to the Financial Conduct Authority's ""FCA"" rules relating to the restrictions on the retail distribution of unregulated collective investment schemes and close substitutes which came into effect on 1 January 2014."
The Board has been advised that the Company would qualify as an investment trust if it were resident in the UK, and therefore the Board believes that its shares are excluded from the restrictions contained in the new rules.
It is the Board's intention that the Company will make all reasonable efforts to continue to conduct its affairs in such a manner so that its shares can be recommended to ordinary retail investors in accordance with the FCA's rules relating to non-mainstream pooled investment products.
The Board has however been advised that no guidance on the application of the proposed rules to non-UK companies has been published by the FCA and, further, that the proposed rules may be subject to change.
Any subsequent changes to the assessment of the application of the proposed rules to the Company will be communicated via an RIS announcement.
