Going concern In accordance with The Financial Reporting Councils guidance on going concern and liquidity risk, the Directors have undertaken a rigorous review of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
The Companys principal risks are market related and include market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
An explanation of these risks and how they are managed is contained in Note 20 to the financial statements.
The Companys assets, the majority of which are investments in quoted securities, exceed its liabilities significantly.
All borrowings require the prior approval of the Board.
Gearing levels and compliance with loan convenants are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The two 25 million loan facilities which were due to expire in May 2013 were replaced on 6 February 2013 with a 50 million facility maturing 31 December 2014.
In accordance with the Companys Articles of Association, shareholders have the right to vote on the continuation of the Company every three years and a resolution to that effect was approved at the AGM held on 23 April 2013.
After making enquiries and notwithstanding the above, the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Conflicts of interest Each Director submits a list of potential conflicts of interest to the Nomination Committee on an annual basis.
The Committee considers these carefully, taking into account the circumstances surrounding them, and makes a recommendation to the Board on whether or not the potential conflicts should be authorised.
Board authorisation is for a period of one year.
Having considered the lists of potential conflicts there were no situations which gave rise to a direct or indirect interest of a Director which conflicted with the interests of the Company.
Bribery Act 2010 The Company has a zero tolerance policy towards bribery and is committed to carrying out business fairly, honestly and openly.
The Manager, Administrator and company secretary also adopt a zero tolerance approach and have policies and procedures in place to prevent bribery.
Greenhouse gas emissions As the Companys activities are all outsourced to third parties, the Company has no greenhouse gas emissions to report.
Director indemnification and insurance The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity in favour of each of the Directors.
The deeds cover any liabilities that may arise to a third party, other than the Company, for negligence, default or breach of trust or duty.
The Directors are not indemnified in respect of liabilities to the Company, any regulatory or criminal fines, any costs incurred in connection with criminal proceedings in which the Director is convicted or civil proceedings brought by the Company in which judgement is given against him.
In addition, the indemnity does not apply to any liability to the extent that it is recovered from another person.
The Company maintains Directors and Officers liability insurance.
Principal risks and uncertainties These are set out at page 23 as part of the Strategic Report.
