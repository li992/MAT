BUSINESS REVIEW 8 REED ELSEVIER Reed Elsevier Reed Elsevier is a world leading provider of information solutions for professional customers across industries.
We help scientists make new discoveries, lawyers win cases, doctors save lives, corporations build commercial relationships, insurance companies assess risk, and government and financial institutions detect fraud.
We achieve this by using our deep customer understanding to combine high-quality content & data with analytics & technology in global platforms.
These solutions often account for about 1% of our customers total cost base but can have a significant, positive impact on the economics of the remaining 99%.
We seek to build leading positions in long-term growth markets by leveraging our institutional skills, assets and resources across Reed Elsevier, both to build solutions for our customers and to pursue cost efficiencies.
Across Reed Elsevier, we are systematically migrating in this direction, primarily through organic development, by investing in the transformation of our assets and building out new products and solutions in adjacent markets and geographies.
We are supplementing organic growth with selective acquisitions that can accelerate our strategy with good returns.
We continue to divest assets that we are unable to align in this direction, or where we do not see significant future value creation.
