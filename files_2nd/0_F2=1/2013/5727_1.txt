The key customers of EVRAZ KGOK are EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK, What is the economic effect of which accounted for 88% of supplies, with the EVRAZ VGOKs disposal?
In order Management estimates the annualised to cut transportation costs and improve In October 2013, EVRAZ positive effect at US$16-17 million at current profit margins, sales to domestic customers spot prices.

Domestic sales were 4% of total external oldest iron ore asset in the sales in 2013 compared to 1% in 2012 and Is EVRAZ going to cooperate Urals, EVRAZ VGOK.
What was this positive trend is expected to continue.
with the new owner of VGOK the rationale for the disposal?
In 2013, Evrazruda mined 10.2 million EVRAZ VGOK was developed to supply iron ore tonnes of iron ore with an average Fe grade to the EVRAZ NTMK steel mill also located in Yes.
Simultaneous with the signing of the of 30.9% which was used to produce 3.9 the Urals region.
However, once EVRAZ NTMK VGOK sale agreement, we have signed a million tonnes of iron ore concentrate 61.6% switched to using only EVRAZ KGOKs vanadium three-year agreement for the supply of iron ore Fe, all of which was supplied to EVRAZ containing iron ore products as feedstock in concentrate from VGOK to EVRAZ ZSMK on iron ZSMK.
The results include the volumes 2009, EVRAZ VGOKs production was no longer ore market terms, processing of by-products of the Teya and Abakan mines, which will technically compatible with EVRAZ NTMKs on preferential terms and a 10-year agreement continue to supply iron ore to EVRAZ on steelmaking operations.
As a result EVRAZ for VGOK to process certain of EVRAZ NTMKs market terms, but accounted for as external VGOK sold its products mostly on the open by-products.
The new owner of VGOK is a purchases subsequent to their disposal.
The cash cost large iron ore producer in the Urals region and of iron ore concentrate production at EVRAZ also works closely with many steelmakers in In 2014, VGOK will also supply iron ore VGOK is over US$100, amongst the highest the region.
products to EVRAZ ZSMK on market terms.
in the mining industry, and in the current economic environment with decreasing prices for iron ore EVRAZ VGOKs operations were unprofitable.
Why wouldnt the Company supply EVRAZ VGOKs iron ore to its EVRAZ ZSMK steel operations?
Although EVRAZ ZSMK could use EVRAZ VGOKs production, it is situated a long way from EVRAZ VGOK, in Siberia, Novokuznetsk, Kemerovo region.
This distance would make supplies of EVRAZ VGOKs iron ore financially unviable.

However, due to continuing performing dangerous works.
weak steel industry fundamentals, domestic coal prices declined in H2 2013.
Are the safety and efficiency programmes which EVRAZ is implementing interrelated?
To give you an example: as safety has become our top priority, we decided to stop mining works at the Abashevskaya mine.
It is the ultimate solution of all safety issues, and we have adopted a series of initiatives, including job placements of the released miners at the Companys other mines, to ensure social issues are managed appropriately.
The main argument in favour of shutting the mine was the high risk of flooding due to large underground water accumulation.
Unfortunately, we had an accident with a mine flood at another mine in March 2013 that resulted in four fatalities.
Our aim, therefore, has been to prevent similar accidents in the future.
Aside from the labour safety risk, the Abashevskaya mine is one of the oldest mines in the Kuzbass area and cash costs are approximately twice as high as the current market price which makes operations uneconomic in current market conditions.

Aggressive importing into North EVRAZ enjoys a leading market share in North America due to strong customer relationships, multiple plant footprint, favourable geographic locations and Made in Canada labelling for further development of its large diameter pipe business.
2013 was a successful year for large diameter pipes with volumes more than doubling vs. 2012 and the Company achieved its highest historical shipments across an increased product range.
The Portland and Camrose large diameter mills were restarted to meet additional demand.
Demand for large diameter pipes is expected to remain driven by new export terminals and associated pipelines and sustainable oil pipeline demand from Canada.
Small diameter OCTG production at the lower end of the market was impacted by intense competition from imports causing pricing declines and the commoditisation of low-end products.
Shipments of OCTG pipes were in line with 2012 volumes.
To meet market demand from horizontal, directional, and unconventional drilling, EVRAZ North EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 61 STEEL: NORTH AMERICA Continued Interview with Pavel Tatyanin, Senior Vice President, International business ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT An LNG liquefied natural gas pipeline between Canada and Portland is already in the works and EVRAZ is best positioned to benefit from the development of LNG as it is a reliable pipe supplier with a solid reputation.
OCTG, or small diameter pipes, including drill pipes, pipe casings and oil pipes, are another segment that is set for growth.
Based on the location of our assets, we expect demand for OCTG to come from oil and gas producers in the What were the achievements Dakotas, West Canada and Colorado: for them, of the International division a shortage of OCTG is currently a major production-limiting factor.
In Calgary, heat-treated pipe production Demand for flats is driven both internally, by volumes hit an all-time high of 7,400 tonnes.
In our growing pipe production volumes, and Regina, December 2013 saw an all-time externally, by the demand coming from railway monthly record in flats production.
at DMZ Petrovskogo, last year they posted a 21% year-on-year steel production increase What will you focus on to despite all the hardships the plant has seen.
At EVRAZ Highveld, January of 2014 has been ensure growth of the business the best month over the last 3 and a half years in North America?
thanks to a huge internal effort against the While we have a firm foothold in those regions, background of a growing market.
we must not lose our focus: improving product quality is key to sustaining and growing our What is the market presence.
Speaking of pipe quality, for example, environment in North America today, unfinished green pipe is a major part of our sales.
To change that and add more value, and how does it affect EVRAZ we are set to grow our finishing capacities.
A heat treatment line is under way in Alberta: Although EVRAZ North America is commonly our premium connection offering is good and perceived solely as a steel-making company, we will build on that technology further.
we increasingly benefit from the North American oil and gas renaissance.
Our large diameter pipe assets are the most direct and obvious beneficiaries.
Performance in the previous two or three years was good, with solid demand and well utilised capacities and we are well positioned to have yet another good year in 2014.
