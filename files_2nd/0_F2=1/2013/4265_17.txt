Financial report continued Trading Summary We summarise below our performance during 2012 in comparison to 2011.
For a more detailed explanation of movements, please see the in-depth analysis starting on page 24.
Revenue in 2012 grew 21% to $1,025.4 million following the inclusion of a full year of trading activity for the operations acquired as part of the Zoran acquisition compared to the four months in 2011 from completion of the acquisition to the year end.
We also saw growth in the Voice & Music segment mainly due to increased volumes of higher priced products.
Our IFRS gross margin increased during the year to 49.6% 2011: 45.5% mainly due to a shift in product mix to higher margin Voice & Music business, from lower margin handset sales.
This increase was partially offset by amortisation of intangible assets acquired with Zoran.
underlying gross margins increased to 50.8% 2011: 49.8% due to the same shift in product mix.
Total operating costs R&D and SG&A increased due to full year impact of the employees and cost base absorbed from the Zoran acquisition compared to the four months in 2011 from completion of the acquisition to the year end.
This was partially offset by the effect of restructuring activities during the year.
In addition employee numbers and the overall cost base were also reduced following the Samsung Transaction in October 2012.
Samsung Transaction On 4 October 2012, we completed the disposal of our handset connectivity and handset location development operations to the Samsung Group for cash consideration of $310 million Samsung Transaction.
This transaction included the transfer of 311 employees, certain rights over technology, in addition to the transfer of 21 uS patents and respective international counterparts in the areas of handset connectivity and handset location.
As a consequence, the Group discontinued investment in future handset location and handset connectivity technologies.
The terms of the Samsung Transaction included a potential purchase price adjustment of up to $10 million increase or decrease depending on the timing of certain deliverables that CSR and Samsung agreed to deliver together.
At 27 December 2012, the fair value of this adjustment was deemed to be $nil.
During 2013 the adjustment terms were amended which reduced this to a maximum of $5 million increase or decrease.
As at 27 December 2013 we have recorded a $5 million liability based on our assessment of the probability of a negative adjustment arising.
In 2012 a gain of $127.2 million was recorded from the Samsung Transaction, with an associated tax charge of $56.3 million.
See note 33 to the financial statements for further details.
In addition, as part of the Samsung Transaction 9.93 million of our ordinary shares were issued to Samsung Electronics Europe Holding Coperatief u.
Returns to Shareholders During 2012, we bought back 2.45 million ordinary shares for $9.4 million.
In addition, on 30 November 2012, the Company completed a tender offer and purchased 49.08 million ordinary shares for $285 million.
In respect of the 2012 financial year the Company paid dividends of $0.118 per ordinary share, of which $0.08 was paid as a final dividend in June 2013, and $0.038 was paid as an interim dividend in September 2012. Review of 2013 Segmental performance We divide our operations into two business groups, Core and Legacy.
Core comprises our Auto, Voice & Music and Consumer segments, while our Legacy segment comprises businesses where, following strategic transactions, we no longer invest.
Specifically, Legacy consists of the discontinued Home Entertainment business lines acquired as part of the acquisition of Zoran in 2011 and the handset connectivity and handset location business lines that we retained following the Samsung Transaction in 2012.
Results for our four segments are regularly reviewed by senior management including the CEO who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to understand how each area has impacted the results of our Group and to assist in the allocation of resources.
Therefore we report the results of these business areas as operational and reporting segments as defined by IFRS 8.
There were no changes to these segments during 2013.

indb 22 11 03 2014 21:17 CSR in review Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information The table below shows our segmental performance in 2013 and 2012.
During 2013, we saw higher volumes from the continued growth in adoption rates of Bluetooth, location products and Wi-Fi technologies in cars.
This is part of the general trend by Tier One manufacturers to adopt connectivity and location features in their vehicles and we expect this to continue as car manufacturers seek to provide drivers and passengers with enhanced in-car information and entertainment.
The underlying operating loss in 2013 for the Auto segment was $7.4 million compared to a profit of $3.2 million in 2012.
The fall in profitability reflected increased R&D investment in this segment during 2013 as part of our strategy to develop the next generation of automotive connectivity devices.
We expect that the higher level of investment in this area will continue during 2014 to support our strategy to grow this segment.
Consumer In 2013, revenue from our Consumer segment decreased 30% to $181.5 million from $258.7 million in 2012.
This decrease was primarily driven by a 58% fall in revenue from our Cameras business line, reflecting the decline in the digital-still camera market as consumers continued to switch to photo technology embedded in smartphones.
The underlying operating loss for Consumer in 2013 was $70.4 million 2012 underlying operating loss $15.6 million.
While gross margin percentages in Consumer business lines remained strong, the operating loss increased compared to 2012, as a result of the lower sales volumes in Cameras mentioned above.
In addition, profitability declined further as we continued to invest in R&D for the nascent Bluetooth Smart and Indoor Location technologies, which form part of the Consumer segment.
We see these as areas of future growth potential, but at present they are nascent markets where we do not yet have significant volumes of sales.
We expect to continue to invest in these technologies in 2014 and beyond to support our strategy and grow this segment.
Voice & Music In 2013, revenue from our Voice & Music segment increased 64% to $312.0 million, from $190.2 million in 2012.
During 2013 we continued to see strong growth in Voice & Music driven by the increased consumer demand for playing digital content wirelessly on remote speakers, speaker docks and wireless stereo headphones.
We believe these trends will continue in 2014.
In the first half of 2013, we saw significant additional revenue for our mono audio headset products due to demand driven by enforcement of handsfree driving legislation in China, which, as expected, did not continue into the second half of the year.
underlying operating profit for Voice & Music in 2013 grew to $123.1 million 2012 $75.1 million, due to volume growth in higher margin stereo products, as well as the impact of the above mentioned increased volume of mono headset sales in China.
