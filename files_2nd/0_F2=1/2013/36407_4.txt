Oxford Street is a key retail destination, generating average weekly footfall of more than 600,000 visitors.
However, East Oxford Street Oxford Street had been blighted for a generation by, amongst other things, the uncertainty around whether Crossrail would progress resulting in significant under-investment and relatively low rental levels.
Crossrail delivery is now well underway, with new stations at Tottenham Court Road and Dean Street being built.
Investment in the area is increasing, high quality retailers are opening stores and footfall is on the up.
Our experience at Mount Royal at the western end of Oxford Street demonstrates that increased footfall can transform the rental tone.
With our two significant development schemes within 50 metres of the Dean Street Crossrail station, GPE will contribute to this regeneration and materially benefit from the resulting improvement in rental levels.
Together these schemes will deliver around 500,000 sq ft of high W quality retail, ofce and residential space.
Our success in the West... Oxford Circus New Bond Street Marble Arch Mount Royal, W1 Our active asset management, combined with the additional footfall from a new Primark store at the western end of Oxford Street, has allowed GPE to transform the retail offering and increase Zone A rents.
