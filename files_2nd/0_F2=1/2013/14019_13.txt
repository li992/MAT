2013 PERFORMANCE continued AerospAce division mArKet overvieW Senior continues to enjoy strong demand from the large commercial aircraft sector, where order books are at record levels.
The regional and business jet markets are satisfactory but, asanticipated, the military and defence sector remains challenging.
CAPABILITIES Design and manufacture of systems for delivery of air, hydraulic fluids and fuel to critical airborne system functions in composite and metallic materials.
Design and manufacture of maintenance-free solutions for harsh operating environments.
Precision-machined complex products and assemblies for airframe structures and systems.
Provision of engine core, ancillary systems and related structural products to major gas turbine engine manufacturers.
Manufacturing hotand cold-formed components, complex fabricated assemblies and thermal insulation heat shields and systems.
