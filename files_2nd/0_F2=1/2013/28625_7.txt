Legal proceedings As reported in the 2012 report and accounts, a claim relating to the management of a Jersey trust has been filed against a former employee and director of a former subsidiary and others and that former subsidiary has recently been joined in as a defendant.
In addition, the company issued proceedings against certain of its civil liability professional indemnity insurers in respect of the former employees potential liabilities arising out of the Jersey claim.
In November 2013 the company announced that judgment had been handed down following the trial in the Commercial Court in London in respect of the insurance case.
In December, the company and the former employee in question decided to appeal subrogation aspects of the judgment and our insurers also decided to appeal coverage aspects of the judgment.
The hearing of those appeals before the Court of Appeal is expected to take place in the second half of 2014.
The underlying Jersey claim is now expected to come to trial towards the end of 2015.
Further detail on these matters is set out in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
The board believes that, whilst legal costs may continue to be incurred, it is more likely than not that any final judgment in relation to the above claims will result in no liability to the company, and accordingly no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements.
