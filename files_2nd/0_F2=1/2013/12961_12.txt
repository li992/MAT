45 45 Annual Report 2013 | Randgold Resources Kibali gold mine continued Kibali the history before Randgold The first gold discovery in the Kilo region of the DRC was made In April 2007, a commission was formed by the DRC government in 1903 by Belgian miners.
In 1906 gold was discovered in the to review approximately 60 mining agreements entered into Moto area and in 1926 the two areas were combined and held by parastatal companies of the DRC government, including by a single company, Kilo-Moto, which subsequently became those of the Moto Goldmines group.
In January 2008, Moto Goldmines purchased the interests of the privately owned DRC OKIMO and more recently was renamed SOKIMO, the DRC company in exchange for cash and shares in Moto Goldmines parastatal gold mining company.
The Belgians operated at with the result that Moto Goldmines became the sole partner least two shafts and a number of open pits which reached of OKIMO.
After the DRC gained independence, production declined and the mine ceased Following the completion of the DRC mining review a joint operating in the late 1990s.
During the 1980s and 1990s, the venture agreement was entered into between the Moto country set out to attract international investment in KiloGoldmines group and OKIMO in March 2009, as a result of Moto, with the aim of reviving gold mining in the area.
At that which the mining titles were transferred from OKIMO to Kibali time, some of the largest global gold mining companies held Goldmines, a DRC incorporated company, and the equity of mineral rights in the area, but no significant exploration or Kibali Goldmines was held as to 70% by Moto Goldmines and mine development took place.
In April 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary of Moto Goldmines entered into a joint venture with a privately owned DRC company to form a number of local operating companies.
These operating companies in turn entered into seven subleasing agreements and a technical and financial assistance contract with OKIMO which at that time was the owner of the mining titles.
Under these arrangements the Moto Goldmines group was earning-in interests in these areas in exchange for exploration and the completion of a feasibility study.
In November 2006, Moto Goldmines entered into a protocol agreement with OKIMO to consolidate the leasing agreements into one consolidated lease with new terms to govern the development of the project.

Only oxide and transition ore was mined during the period, Construction highlights achieved during 2013 include: oxide circuit, first and second elution circuits with sulphide ore exposed at year end.
The stripping ratio at commissioned: the end of the year was 4.7:1.
Dewatering of the KCD pit started carbon regeneration area completed: during Q3 2012 and resulted in uninterrupted open pit mining first and second gold room electrowinning bank during the period under review.
Twelve pumps were operating commissioned and operational: at year end with a dewatering rate of 71l sec.
oxide and sulphide mill installation commissioned: reagents stores completed: Processing plant and engineering Nzoro 2 hydropower generating equipment placed in Processing position: The plant treated 808kt of oxide material at 3.7g t. Recoveries Nzoro 2 penstock piping more than 50% complete: of 91.3% were in line with expectations for processing the first and second CIL tailings pump train, valve train and oxide material.
pipeline commissioned: 24 diesel generators installed and commissioned: Following the commissioning of the first oxide stream at construction of supporting mining infrastructure including the end of the third quarter, the second mill and feed circuit belonging to the second sulphide stream was commissioned and started milling oxide ore in the fourth quarter, adding to throughput.
The second elution and electrowinning circuit was also commissioned and is now in operation.
Only the secondary crushing, flotation and concentrate handling circuits remain to be commissioned in Q1 2014, in order to complete the full sulphide recovery circuit, prior to commissioning this circuit on sulphide ore. Engineering and power generation The plant was commissioned using the 36 high speed thermal diesel generators which had been installed to meet the power needs of the mine during lower rainfall periods.
Construction and underground mine development The project team made excellent progress during the year under review, focusing on defined areas to enable construction of the first oxide stream of the metallurgical plant to be completed by the end of Q3 2013, to enable the earlier than scheduled gold production.
