1 Reducing water wasted in water-stressed areas We have designated 12 of our production sitesas water-stressed.
In these sites, our goal isto reduce water wasted by 50% by 2015, compared to a 2007 baseline.
Our progress this year a 7% reduction, contributing to a 21% reduction against our 2007 baseline is the result of a number of conservation measures and technology applications, including water recycling and reuse, in particular at our sites in the most water-stressed areas.
Diageo defines water-stressed sites as those locations that pose a higher risk for water insecurity now and or into the future: the definition is based on an evaluation of physical or economic water scarcity as well as regulatory and social risk.

While pollution is less dispersed and where it may to reduce the polluting the volume of wastewater discharge increased have greater environmental impacts on ecosystems or the availability of potable water.
power of wastewater from this year by 9.8% compared with 2012, there have been several encouraging developments In the last year, wastewater BOD volumes our operations by 90% which we believe will keep us on course to emitted to inland rivers from our brewing sites in2014.
At our Cameronbridge in Africa were reduced by 25%, and overall BOD load was reduced by 29%, a result of distillery in Scotland, which was responsible for 60% of our global BOD in 2012, BOD output fell sustained investment in effluent treatment by 12% in the last quarter of 2013, during the plant expansion and upgrades.
