Non-IFRS measures Although we prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, we also report and discuss additional measures that we call underlying.
These underlying measures are not IFRS measures.
Management believes that these underlying measures provide investors with useful information regarding our ongoing performance by excluding certain amounts that are included in the comparable IFRS numbers.
You can find a description of these underlying measures and their limitations, an explanation of why management believes they are useful to investors and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure on pages 150 to 153.

For a more detailed explanation of movements please see the in-depth analysis on pages 22 to 26.
This was mainly due to: A decrease in Legacy revenue during 2013 we experienced an expected fall in sales across all Legacy products, but in particular the revenue from sales of handset connectivity and handset location products, which transferred to Legacy in 2012 following the disposal of related development operations to Samsung the Samsung Transaction which is more fully described on page 22.
Lower Camera sales volumes during 2013 we saw a significant decline in sales volumes of digital still camera products reflecting a broader shift in the market from point-and-shoot models to smartphones and tablets.
This is reported in our Consumer segment.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from the Voice & Music and Auto segments, 64% and 8% respectively, due to increased sales volumes of higher priced products.
