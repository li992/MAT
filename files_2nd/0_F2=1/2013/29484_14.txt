26 St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Review continued section 4: Cash Result and Capital In addition to presenting the financial performance on the IFRS and EEV basis, we also provide an analysis of the sources of cash emergence in the year, which we refer to as the cash result.
The cash result is based on the IFRS result, but removes non-cash items such as DAC, DIR and deferred tax.
It is also adjusted to reflect a level of regulatory solvency constraint on profits emerging from regulated companies, such as our insurance businesses, in line with that required by the UK regulators.
The effect is a measure which more reflects the underlying cash emergence of the business, and which is available to pay dividends.
An underlying cash result is also presented, stripping out the effects of one off items, timing variances and capitalised impacts of changes in solvency requirements.
Year ended Year Ended 31 december 31 December 2013 2012 million Million underlying cash result 139.9 84.0 Reinsurance transaction 18.3 Variance 10.6 7.7 Cash result 168.8 91.7 In 2013, the underlying cash result was 139.9 million 2012: 84.0 million some 67% higher than the prior year, principally due to an increase in the net income from funds under management.
In both years, there were positive variances, and so the overall cash result increased to 168.8 million 2012: 91.7 million up 84%.
The cash result is a combination of the cash emerging from the business in force at the start of the year less the investment made to acquire new business during the year.
The tables and commentary below provide an indicative analysis of the cash result, identifying the different contributions from the business in-force at the start of the year, and the new business added during the year.

In 2013, the tax rate has reduced by 1% compared to the prior year.
The net annual management fee: This is the manufacturing margin the Group retains from the funds under management after payment of the associated costs e. g. investment advisory fees and Partner remuneration.
Broadly speaking, the Group retains around 1% before tax 0.77% after tax of funds under management.
The level of net annual management fee was some 25% higher than 2012.
This increase is in line with the growth in funds under management which averaged 39.5 billion in 2013 compared to 31.5billion in 2012.
Unwind of surrender penalties: This relates to the reserving methodology applied to the surrender penalties within the charging structure of the single premium life bonds and pensions.
At the outset of the product, we establish a liability net of the outstanding surrender penalty which would apply if the policy were to be encashed.
As the surrender penalty reduces to zero, so the liability to the policyholder is enhanced by increasing their funds by 1% per annum over the first six years of the product life, to correspond to this unwind of the surrender penalty.
In other words, there is a cost which offsets the annual management fee above.
Like the net annual management fee, the unwind of surrender penalties increases with the impact of investment growth of funds under management.
However the increase is also impacted by new funds but offset by the fact that the funds added six years ago have completed the surrender penalty period.
As commented on in Section 1, the level of unwind of surrender penalties will increase in future years due to the application of surrender penalties being extended to all pension business.
This will act as a slight brake on the future growth in net income from funds under management.
Margin arising from new business: This is the cash impact of new business in the year after taking into account the directly attributable expenses.
As commented on in Section 1, as part of the implementation of the RDR rules, the application of surrender penalties was extended to all pension business.
This resulted in a significant increase in the margin arising from new business.
However, as also noted in Section 1, the positive impact has been offset by loss of tax relief on advice costs.
The overall impact was still an increase in the margin arising from new business, to 37.8 million in the year from 13.3 million in 2012.
The impact of this increase in the margin was the key driver of the reduction in the cost of investment in new business in the year.
Establishment expenses: These are the expenses of running the Groups infrastructure as shown in the table on page 31.
In line with the rest of this table, they are presented after allowance for tax.
These expenses were 13% higher in the current year.
The post-tax figure in this analysis has increased at a slightly higher rate than shown on the aforementioned table due to the impact of differing tax rates between the two reporting periods.
Development expenses: These represent the sum of the other expenditure noted in the table on page 31 e. g. developments, the cost of regulatory change and Academy.
The impact on the cash result in the year was 10.8 million 2012: 8.8 million.
Regulatory fees: This relates to the fees payable to the Regulatory bodies and the FSCS levy for the year.
The regulatory fees payable in the year were 8.9 million 2012: 9.0 million.
Shareholder interest arising from regulated and non-regulated business: This is the actual income accruing on the investments and cash held for regulatory purposes together with the interest received on the surplus capital held by the Group.
The small increase in interest received reflects the increased level of assets invested.
Miscellaneous: This represents the cash flow of the business not covered in any of the other categories.
In addition to the income and expenses from other operations of the business, this item has historically included the emerging profit of the groups protection life, critical illness and PHI business.
As commented on in Section 1, as a result of the Reassurance transaction in the year, the emerging profits were capitalised and are reflected elsewhere.
This item has therefore reduced by c. 3 million compared to prior years.
This item also reflects the impact of structural timing differences in the life company tax computation.
As a consequence of the loss of tax relief on advice costs commented on in Section 1, this item reflects the benefit of the unwind of the outstanding tax relief on historic advice costs.
The positive impact in 2013 is expected to reduce by c. 1-2 million per annum over the next six years.
However, the item will instead benefit from the positive impact of utilisation of the Group capital losses during this period.
Reinsurance transaction: As commented on in Section 1, there has been a one-off impact on the cash result of 18.3 million, reflecting the release of the associated prudent solvency reserves together with the realisation of the capitalised value of expected future margins.
Variance: This reflects variances in the cash result in a year due to the impact of actual experience including economic assumptions changes and investment performance on insurance reserves, as well as variances in the settlement of tax related liabilities between the policyholders unit-linked funds, the shareholder and HMRC.
In 2013, the impact of strong investment performance, improvements in real yields and some assumption changes contributed to a significant reduction in insurance reserves, releasing additional profit of 5.1 million.
The result also benefited by 6.0 million from utilisation of brought forward pension losses and by nearly 10 million from other tax variance effects.
The positive impacts were offset by a 4.0 million post tax cost of back-office infrastructure costs and 4.6 million post-tax cost associated with LBG.
The overall impact in the year was an increase in the result of 10.6 million.
The variance of 7.7 million in 2012 included 4.0 million from a modification to the calculation of the surrender penalty position.
28 St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Review continued Return on In-Force business As shown in the tables above, the return on the in-force business is mainly driven by the level of the annual management fees, the unwind of the surrender penalties, and the level of expenses.
The vast majority of the return relates to the net income from funds under management annual management fees less the unwind of the surrender penalty.
Funds under management have been increasing and, as they continue to develop, the future net income should also increase correspondingly.
In addition, a proportion of the new business has a surrender penalty which unwinds during the first six years and, consequently, this business does not make a meaningful contribution to the cash result until year seven.
The table below provides an estimated breakdown of the single premium business over the last six years where these surrender penalties apply.
These premiums are not yet generating income within the cash result.
with surrender Year penalties billion 2008 1.4 2009 1.6 2010 2.1 2011 2.2 2012 2.4 2013 3.5 total 13.2 The total business not yet contributing to the cash result is 13.2 billion which is nearly 30% of the total funds under management at 31 December 2013.
Clearly, the potential of this business depends on retention of our clients: however, for illustration purposes, if all the business reached the end of the surrender period then the annual post-tax cash result based on 0.77% post-tax earnings from funds under management would be some 102 million higher.
ignores stock market movements and outflows since the date of original client investment.
The Board therefore expects the cash earnings from the in-force business to increase as funds under management grow and the business matures.
Return on Investment in new business As noted in the table on page 26, 52.3 million 2012: 60.5 million of the cash arising from the in-force business has been re-invested in acquiring the new business during the year.
This investment in new business will generate income in the future that should significantly exceed the cost of investment and therefore provide positive returns for shareholders.
The table below provides details of the new business added during the reporting periods and different measures of valuing the investment: Year ended Year Ended 31 december 31 December 2013 2012 Post-tax investment in new business Million 52.3 60.5 Post-tax present value of expected future cash returns Million 314.1 278.8 Post-tax present value of expected profit from investment Million 261.8 218.3 Gross inflow of funds under management Billion 6.8 5.6 Investment as % of gross inflow 0.8% 1.1% New business margin % of manufactured APE 42.9% 43.4% Cash payback period years 4 4 Internal rate of return net of tax 28.4% 22.5% The investment as a percentage of net inflow of funds under management was 1.2% compared with 1.8% for the prior year.
03183415 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 29 The level of investment to acquire new business is not expected to increase significantly in future years and therefore the proportion of the cash generated from the in-force business that will be available to pay dividends to shareholders is expected to continue expanding.
Capital Position In addition to presenting an IFRS balance sheet on page 104 and an EEV balance sheet on page 168, we believe it is beneficial to provide a balance sheet using the approach underlying our cash result.
This is because the cash result is adjusted for non-cash items such as DAC, DIR and deferred tax.
The Board therefore considers this cash result balance sheet provides the best indication of the free capital of the Group which could be available to pay dividends.
The following table analyses the differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the cash result balance sheet.
These adjustments include netting out assets and liabilities of the policyholder interest in unit-linked funds, and removal of a number of significant non-cash adjustments in particular DAC, DIR and deferred tax.

30 St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Review continued The movement in the cash result net assets is equal to the cash result adjusted for dividends paid in the year and other changes in equity excluding the cost of share options see page 103 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The table above provides an analysis of the differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the cash result balance sheet.
As in previous years, we also provide an analysis of the Solvency position.
The key difference between the cash result net assets above and the Solvency net assets is an amount of additional reserves arising from the Irish solvency regulations.
These reserves include additional prudential reserves over that required by the UK regulator.
As a result, the Solvency position is 507.6 million, which is 25.1 million lower than the cash result net assets of 532.7 million 2012: 403.5 million and 418.5 million, respectively.
The Solvency position can be further analysed between regulated and non-regulated entities, and can be assessed against the solvency capital requirement as noted in the table below: Other life Regulated Other total million million million million solvency position Solvency net assets 284.2 38.9 184.5 507.6 Solvency requirement 49.3 17.1 Solvency ratio 576% 227% Included within the other capital resources is an implied reserve that is being built up to cover one years dividend cost.
At 31 December 2013 the amount set aside to date was 70 million compared to a full year dividend cost of 82 million.
Comparison with previous valuations would show that the Group solvency position has become increasingly resilient, despite market volatility in recent years, reflecting the Groups low appetite for market, credit and liquidity risk in relation to solvency.
The Group continues to be capitalised well in excess of regulatory solvency requirements, with nearly 70% of cash result and solvency assets invested prudently in cash, AAA rated money market funds and UK government securities.
Other assets principally other receivables are less liquid.
