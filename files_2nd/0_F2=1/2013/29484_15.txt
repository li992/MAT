These costs are met from corresponding policy margins and any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not directly impact the profitability of the Company.
The other new business related costs, such as Partner incentivisation, vary with the level of new business.
As new business rises or falls, these costs will move in the corresponding direction.
Establishment costs are the running costs of the Groups infrastructure and are relatively fixed in nature in the short term, although they are subject to inflationary increases.
These costs will increase as the infrastructure expands to manage the higher number of existing clients and the growth in the Partnership and business volumes.
The growth in establishment expenses during the year was higher than our original expectations as a consequence of an increase in expenditure associated with the high level of Partner recruitment in the year together with the costs relating to the higher business volumes.
We expect establishment expenses in 2014 to increase marginally ahead of our usual 10% operating target reflecting the full year costs of the additional infrastructure added in 2013.
We have reverted to showing the Academy costs separately given the importance of this investment we are making for the future.
The increase in the costs in 2013 reflects the increased number of students within the programme.
2014 will see further growth in this investment as the Academy continues to expand and with the commencement of a regional academy in Manchester later in the year.
Other development costs represent the expenditure associated with the on-going development in our investment proposition, corporate initiatives, technology improvements and other system developments.
These costs will vary year by year depending upon the extent of change and or investment planned.
The development expenses were 8.5 million during 2013 2012: 4.6 million and we expect a further increase in costs in 2014.
As announced in the half year report, we have commenced an investment programme working with our key outsourced provider to bring together and enhance our back office systems, prepare us for continued growth and achieve future efficiency savings.
As expected, the project costs for 2013 were 5.0 million and we anticipate expenditure of some 10.0 million during 2014.
The regulatory costs represent the fees payable to the regulatory bodies of 6.1 million 2012: 5.1million, together with our required contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of 5.5 million 2012: 6.9 million.
These are the one-off costs of changing our systems and process for the implementation of the adviser charging rules.
As these changes have now been implemented, we do not expect further expenditure in 2014.
Contribution from third party product new business reflects the net income received from wealth management business of 8.2 million 2012: 7.8 million, from group pension business of 0.5million 2012: 0.9 million and from Protection business of 11.7 million 2012: 12.7 million.
movement in Funds under management The table below shows the movement in the funds under management of the Group during the reporting period.
Year ended Year Ended 31 december 31 December 2013 2012 billion Billion Opening funds under management 34.8 28.5 New money invested 6.8 5.6 Investment return 5.2 3.0 46.8 37.1 Regular withdrawals maturities 0.7 0.7 Surrenders part surrenders 1.8 1.6 Closing funds under management 44.3 34.8 Implied surrender rate as % of average funds under management 4.7% 4.9% Net inflow of funds 4.30bn 3.35bn Net inflow as % of opening funds under management 12.4% 11.8% Shareholders will be pleased to note that the continued strong retention of funds under management, together with the level of new money invested, provides for a net inflow of funds of 4.3 billion, 1.0billion higher than the prior year.
This net inflow represents 12.4% 2012: 11.8% of opening funds under management and can be viewed as the organic growth of the business.
Noted below is an explanation of regular withdrawals, maturities and surrenders: The regular withdrawals represent those amounts selected by clients which are paid out by way of periodic income.
The withdrawals have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
maturities are those sums paid out where the plan has reached the selected maturity date e. g. retirement date.
The expected maturities have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
03183415 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 33 surrenders and part surrenders are those amounts where clients have chosen to withdraw money from their plan.
Surrenders are assumed to occur in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit based on actual experience, updated on an annual basis, by plan duration and the age of the client.
The implied surrender rate shown in the table above is very much a simple average and reflects only recent experience.
Whilst it could be compared with the long-term assumptions underlying the calculation of the embedded value, it should not be assumed that small movements in this rate will result in a change to the long term embedded value assumptions.
