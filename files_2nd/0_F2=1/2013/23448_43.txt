In July 2013 Electra sold its investment in Allflex to a private equity buyer.
Including proceeds from refinancings between 2003 and 2007, the sale generated a realised return of 15x original cost and an IRR of 28%.
Electra made a new equity investment of 57 million for a minority stake in Allflex alongside the buyer.
Allflex has seen strong growth driven by increased regulation of the food chain to ensure food safety.
Since 1998, the company has expanded geographically, developed new products to address a wider range of animal species, invested in new technologies such as electronic identification or genetic tags, and acquired a number of smaller competitors.
Strong long-term growth prospects are expected to continue from increasing commercial and regulatory requirements for traceability and security in the food chain.
Allflex will benefit from this through its lowcost manufacturing base, continued investment in technology, and further acquisitions.
