GSK Annual Report 2013 111 Governance & remuneration Directors Remuneration Report Deferred Annual Bonus Plan matching awards Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP matching awards are made annually to Executive Directors, based on the individuals mandatory deferral and voluntary bonus election.
The company will match shares or ADS up to one-for-one depending on the companys performance during a three-year performance period.
Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 101 to 103 of this report.
Awards to UK-based Executive Directors are made in the form of nil-cost options.
Once an award vests, the UK-based Executive Director may choose to exercise the award at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
Awards to US-based Executive Directors are made as a conditional award of shares.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of the matching shares or ADS is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant award vests.
If an Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil-cost options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
Dividends are reinvested on the nil-cost options or conditional awards of shares made to Executive Directors up to the date of vesting.

Under the terms of the PSP, the number of shares or ADS vesting is determined following the end of the relevant performance period and is dependent on GSKs performance during that period.
Performance conditions and vesting levels are described on pages 101 to 103.
Dividends are reinvested on the performance shares or ADS awarded to executives throughout the performance period and up to the date of vesting.
At vesting, UK participants receive the relevant number of shares and US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of performance shares is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant PSP award vests.
The PSP awards made to Sir Andrew Witty in 2012, 2013 and 2014 have three year performance periods.
However, the deeds of award specify that 25% of the awards will be subject to a further two year vesting period five years in total.
During this two year period, there are no additional performance criteria and the awards will only lapse if Sir Andrew is dismissed for cause.
The remuneration in respect of these awards will therefore be considered to be realised in full following the determination by the Remuneration Committee of the vesting levels of the initial 75% of the awards i. e. full remuneration will be recognised at the end of the three-year performance period.
