In addition we have sought to increase referrals from community clinics towards our specialty hospitals.
Our marketing team launched several initiatives to engage with the residential community corporates, including holding health awareness sessions and lectures.
We have also worked to increase our engagement with the medical community to showcase our capabilities.
Keeping in mind that a large proportion of outpatients in the UAE visit stand-alone private sector clinics lacking inpatient capacity, we have sought to encourage these third-party operators to refer patients to our hospitals.
Meanwhile, we have continued to invest in new equipment and technologies to complement our service offering and medical staff efforts.
In July 2013 we also supplemented our healthcare assets with the opening of the NMC Day Surgery Centre in Mohammed Bin Zayed City, one of the fastest growing suburbs of Abu Dhabi City.
This facility began receiving its first patients in July 2013 and will act as a referral centre to our growing Abu Dhabi network, thus extending the operational reach and addressable market of Abu Dhabi Specialty Hospital initially, and eventually also Brightpoint Womens Hospital and Khalifa City Hospital.
Operational gearing, our continued drive to enhance our service offering with new higher value added sub-specialties, supported by our growing volumes, and the entry into third party hospital operation 19 and management, are additional contributing factors to the strong performance of the Healthcare division in 2013.
Healthcare Division revenue and patients The Healthcare division reported US$289.3m of revenues in 2013 15.0% year on year.
Division EBITDA amounted to US$81.7m 19.8% year on year, with an EBITDA margin of 28.2% 113bps year on year.
Average revenue per patient reached US$112 6% year on year, supported by a combination of price increases and improved service mix effect, as we continue to enhance our offering of higher value added sub-specialties.
Healthcare division revenue per patient and EBITDA Note: Revenue per patient is based on contribution from our healthcare services, excluding the contribution from the operation & management contract on the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital in UAQ.
It also excludes the contribution from five out of our eight pharmacies, specifically those located around the hospitals rather than within them.
Excluding the government hospital managed by NMC, the division had a total of 261 operational beds 13.5%, year on year out of an unchanged 310 licensed beds, as we continued to phase-in beds mainly in our Dubai Specialty and Al Ain Specialty Hospitals.
We have a 15.8% spare system capacity, measured in beds, which we expect to gradually phase into our operations in 2014 and 2015.
Out of 49 beds yet to become operational, 40 are in our most recent hospital, Al Ain Specialty Hospital, and nine are in Dubai Specialty Hospital.
We expect the continued growth in Al Ain, as demonstrated by the hospitals performance to date, to absorb the remainder of our spare bed capacity in the next couple of years.
Mandatory healthcare insurance adoption in Dubai this year, coupled with growing network referrals from our existing and new healthcare facilities in Dubai, should allow Dubai Specialty Hospital to increase its operational beds.
20 Healthcare division operational beds and occupancy rates As our revenue continued to grow at rapid pace, we enhanced our service ability and revenue generating capacity through the increase in total Healthcare Division staff by 18.3% in FY 2013 to 3,400.
We increased the number of doctors to 503 by year end 2013 19.8% year on year.
Healthcare division staff Division-wide bed occupancy reached 64.7% 420bps year on year, despite the rise in operational beds during the year by 13.5%.
The main reasons behind the improvement in occupancy rates at our hospitals include: patient count increase to almost 2.1m 9.5% year on year : expansion in the proportion of our total patients who are Inpatients to 3.1% 8bps, year on year : and higher average length of stay ALOS.
A like for like comparison based on last years deployed operational bed capacity and FY2013 utilisation, would have yielded an occupancy rate well above the 70% level compared to the 60.5% in FY2012.
We continue to regard full bed occupancy for medical facilities in the UAE to be around 75%, as opposed to 90-95% often experienced in other countries.
The population leveraged reality in the UAE, with around 85% of residents being expatriates, does create higher resident seasonal volatility.
This is typically manifested through extended departures holidays to home country for working expatriates up to one month and even longer for non-working family members particularly during the summer season.
In addition, we highlight that our occupancy figures exclude day surgery patients, as the occupancy calculation we adopt only includes patients staying overnight.
Consequently, we are rapidly approaching full occupancy, even before the effects from further roll-out of universal medical insurance beyond the emirate of Abu Dhabi, hence our investment in new capacity.
21 Abu Dhabi Specialty Hospital Abu Dhabi Specialty Hospital, the Groups first ever hospital, has evolved from being a very small building in the 1970s to a tower on the same land plot with adjacent buildings.
It is located in the densely populated centre of Abu Dhabi City.
This remains the largest patient recipient within the NMC network.
The facility continues to provide a wide range of specialties and had its Joint Commission International JCI accreditation renewed in 2013.
With nearly 40 years of service in the very same area of the city, this hospital has built a noteworthy reputation for quality amongst the Abu Dhabi population.
Reported revenues increased by 12% to US$101m in 2013 compared to the preceding year.
The total number of patients reached 937k 5%, year on year with an average revenue per patient amounting to US$108 7%, year on year.
Occupancy increased by 1,060bps year on year to reach 79% - the highest amongst all NMC healthcare assets.
Al Ain Specialty Hospital NMC Health inaugurated the Al Ain Specialty Hospital in the second largest city within the emirate of Abu Dhabi in 2009.
This expansion was encouraged by the adoption of mandatory healthcare insurance in Abu Dhabi in the immediately preceding years.
Al Ain Specialty Hospital had the JCI accreditation of its quality and service levels renewed for a further three year period in 2012.
Being our most recent hospital addition, we have been gradually introducing this facilitys capacity starting with 12 operational beds, moving up to 45 in 2012 and with 60 beds as of year-end 2013.
As part of our organic expansion and capital projects programme, we are also in the process of developing a medical centre in Al Ains Sanaiya area, which holds a high concentration of industrial establishments.
We believe this will further expand the operational reach and market of the hospital by bringing NMC closer to high population areas and increasing referrals to the specialty hospital.
Al Ain Specialty Hospitals performance has been continuously improving with revenues reaching US$48m in 2013 21% year on year, revenue per patient increased to US$117 8% year on year and occupancy rose to 60% 430bps year on year despite the 33% increase during the year in operational beds.
Dubai Specialty Hospital Opened in 2004, the Dubai Specialty Hospital is well situated in the growing residential area of Al Nahda on the Dubai-Sharjah border, which enables the hospital to take advantage of referrals, not only from both the Dubai General Hospital and Sharjah Medical Centre, but also from certain targeted sections of the population of the northern emirates.
This location has helped the hospital grow significantly since opening.
The facility continues to provide a wide range of specialties.
Dubai Specialty Hospital had its JCI accreditation for its quality and service levels renewed for a further three year period in 2012.
The recent decision by Dubai authorities to initiate the roll out of mandatory healthcare insurance, starting early 2014, is expected to further support the growth of this facility in the coming years.
Dubai Health Authority DHA has reported that nearly two thirds of Dubai residents are uninsured, suggesting a potential phased growth of up to 200% in insured residents over the coming years.
Dubai Specialty Hospital will soon see further support from the NMC DIP General Hospital located on the other side of Dubai.
Dubai Specialty Hospitals performance has been continuously improving with revenues reaching US$56m in 2013 16% year on year, revenue per patient increased to US$164 4% year on year and occupancy declined to 54% -160bps year on year slightly effected by the increase in operational beds at the facility from 75 to 91 beds 21% year on year.
22 Dubai General Hospital Dubai General Hospital was established in 1999, this 10 bed facility is located in the highly populated area of Deira.
The hospital acts as a referral centre to the NMC Dubai Specialty Hospital which is a short distance away.
Dubai General Hospitals revenues reached US$12.2m in 2013 5% year on year, revenue per patient increased to US$62 6% year on year and occupancy reached 44% 580bps year on year.
Sharjah Medical Centre This multi specialist medical centre was opened in 1996 and is located on the busy commuter route along the Corniche in Sharjah.
Since the facility was upgraded in 2010 from a clinic to a medical centre offering increased specialities such as radiology and minor procedures, revenue has increased significantly.
The Group also benefits from referrals made from this facility to the Dubai Specialty Hospital.
This medical centre saw a 26% year on year increase in patients, with revenues reaching US$ 10.3m 16% year on year.
Meanwhile revenue per patient declined to US$67.0 -8% year on year as we expanded our services by offering lower fee procedures.
BR Medical Suites BR Medical Suites is a high-end specialty day surgery, located in Dubai Healthcare City.
It is specifically designed to attract highly experienced doctors from around the world to carry out minimally invasive surgery and other procedures within its modern international standard facility.
The Group acquired BR Medical Suites for a consideration of US$9m paid in cash on 1 July 2012.
During FY 2013 the facility generated revenues of US$ 2.6m and received 9,582 patients 480% year on year.
Revenue per patient was around US$ 269.
While the facilitys total revenues increased, revenue per patient declined by 17%, mainly due to the introduction of new services.
Historically, this day surgery has been focused on high-complexity and high value procedures.
As we widened the service offering, the revenue per patient has declined.
Unlike our other healthcare assets, this day surgery is overwhelmingly focused on utilisation by external doctors.
Consequently, its revenues were accounted for net of the external doctors share.
NMC Day Surgery Centre in Mohammed Bin Zayed City This facility in the rapidly growing Abu Dhabi suburb known as Mohammed Bin Zayed City MBZC began receiving its first outpatients in July 2013.
NMC Day Surgery Centre in Mohammed Bin Zayed City will act as a referral centre to our growing Abu Dhabi hospital network, thus extending the operational reach and addressable market of Abu Dhabi Specialty Hospital initially and eventually also Brightpoint Womens Hospital and Khalifa City Hospital The facility has seen strong monthly growth in patient numbers since opening and, we expect this trend to continue as we open new sections of the day surgery centre.
In addition, we expect to open a pharmacy in the same building in 2014 which should support revenue growth.
Revenue amounted to just under US$1m with over 19,000 patients and US$48 in revenue per patient.
Third party hospital operations & management NMC Health provides operation and management services to third party healthcare asset owners and developers.
Our management service contract to date is for the 205 bed Sheikh Khalifa General Hospital in Umm Al Quwain, which we are managing on behalf of the UAE Ministry of Presidential Affairs since Q4 2012.
This is a five year contract in return for an annual management fee based on qualitative as opposed to financial metrics.
We believe this is the first such contract to manage a large Government healthcare facility awarded by a Government Department to a local UAE business.
This demonstrates the confidence in NMCs significant healthcare experience and capabilities.
23 Capital projects NMC Healths expansion plans, as announced during the IPO in 2012, included five new healthcare assets.
Three of the assets, which included the lease, redesign and equipping of existing buildings are: Brightpoint Womens Hospital 100 bed in Abu Dhabi: NMC Day Surgery Centre in the Mohammed Bin Zayed City Suburb of Abu Dhabi opened in July 2013 : and Dubai Investment Park DIP General Hospital 60 bed..
In addition, a fourth medical facility is being developed the 250 bed Hospital in the Khalifa City suburb of Abu Dhabi.
However, in this case the building is an entirely new development, owned and contracted by NMC Health.
Finally, the plans also included the acquisition of BR Medical Suites completed in 2012, a specialist day surgery centre in Dubai Health Care City DHCC.
The Group faced significant challenges in 2013 to progress the construction of certain of its new facilities, particularly those requiring the re-design and fit-out of existing buildings.
The Brightpoint Womens Hospital, which was originally planned to open in August 2012, has been particularly complex refit and construction slower than expected.
Following a number of delays we are now expecting the facility to open in H1, 2014.
Similarly the DIP General Hospital, construction has been delayed on several occasions and we have also had licensing delays.
We are now expecting the facility to open in H1, 2014.
As a result of the delays experienced, we have introduced new processes for future projects including: appointment of an external project manager for our larger future projects: and enhanced our tendering process, to ensure that appropriately experienced contractors are appointed in the future.
We are also reviewing our internal project management structure and will be making changes to further enhance quality in this area.
The construction of Khalifa City Hospital is progressing well, with the concrete structure of the building now complete.
We continue to target receiving the first patients at this facility starting H1 2015.
The Sanaiya Day Surgery Centre in Al Ain is on track to open in H2, 2014, in-line with our previous guidance on this project.
The building is being adapted internally and equipped for healthcare services with good progress so far.
As a result of the delays in the opening of certain facilities, additional costs in respect of loan interest and leases have been capitalised.
Had these facilities opened in line with original plan these costs would have been expensed.
Other than these items the delays have not resulted in an increase in budgeted capital costs.
Distribution Division Top-line growth in the Distribution division accelerated to 10.7% year on year in 2013, compared to 7% year on year growth between 2011 and 2012, demonstrating the positive impact by the: expansion of the UAE economy: growing population: rise in tourism: substantial increase in retail space: addition of new products to our offering: and positive efforts of the Distribution division team in growing product sales.
24 The division generated revenues of US$ 300.2m 10.7% year on year in FY2013 with 71,215 8 SKUs 8.7% year on year.
EBITDA margins continued to expand on operational gearing, increased efficiencies and economies of scale.
EBITDA reached US$ 29.9m in 2013 14.1% year on year with EBITDA margins exceeding last year by 30bps to reach 10.0% as of year-end 2013.
Distribution divisions revenue and EBITDA contribution FMCG remained the largest segment with 39% of the distribution divisions 2013 revenues, a two percentage point reduction in proportional contribution compared to 2012.
Food & Catering delivered the strongest segmental growth and increased its proportional contribution to 11.8% of the divisions revenues, almost three percentage points higher than in 2012.
8 Stock keeping unit 25 Distribution Divisions Segment contribution FY2012 and 2013 FY2012 FY2013 IT The Group has operated in recent years with legacy IT systems which, as a smaller private company, were appropriate for the needs of the Group.
Following a review of the Groups IT requirements, the Board agreed capital investment in two new primary Group systems: a.
The current HIS system operating within NMC is a home-grown system which has been operating successfully over many years.
Continuing developments in the regulatory framework in the UAE healthcare system, as well as additional monitoring and reporting requirements which the Group feels that it requires as the business grows, has resulted in a decision to implement a new HIS.
The Group has chosen to implement a third party system which is already operating successfully within the UAE regulatory structure.
The implementation will commence in 2014 and is expected to be completed by 2015.
The Company feels that the new system will be robust enough to deal with the demands of significant growth of the business.
Enterprise Resources Planning ERP financial system.
It was reported in the 2012 Annual Report that the Company planned to implement a new financial IT system during 2013.
Implementation of the new system commenced in 2013, but completion will now be delayed following managements decision to switch from instant Go-live to a phased roll out of the new IT system, to enable full testing and the integration of the new Oracle version.
We anticipate the implementation of the new ERP system will be completed in the first half of 2014.
Initial indications from the implementation programe have been encouraging.
The Company has been aware of the need to improve its IT infrastructure and is on track to deliver new IT systems across the Group.
The implementation of new IT systems always presents organisations with a significant challenge, and implementing two new primary systems within the Group will be no exception.
However, the management team and the Board feels that now is an opportune time to be implementing a new IT infrastructure as the Group prepares for significant growth in the coming years.
This investment in new technology will help to reduce an element of manual intervention and improve reporting and therefore the companys internal control environment.
