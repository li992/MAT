Chairmans Statement In another year of demanding market conditions, Croda continued its track record of pre-tax profit and earnings per share growth.
From a strategic perspective, we have made real progress, maintaining our focus on innovation and developing our business in both existing and emerging markets.
With record sales of New and Protected Products NPP across the business, acquisitions in North America and China, three more R&D laboratories, two more customer training centres and further investment in our global sales force, our platform for sustainable, organic growth is much stronger.
Full Year Results Despite 2013 seeing little change to the demanding market environment that we experienced throughout 2012, Croda continued to make further progress with sales, margins and profits reaching record levels.
Turnover from continuing operations increased by 2.4% to 1,077.0m 1 2012: 1,051.9m.
Adjusted operating profit grew by 3.7% to 264.6m 2012: 255.1m and we saw Group return on sales on the same basis increase to 24.6% 2012: 24.3%.
The sales performance was mixed with strong growth seen in NPP, slower growth in areas where we have less differentiation from our competitors and declines in commodity sales.
Our ongoing success in being able to improve the quality of our business mix can be clearly seen in robust margins and the overall increase in Martin Flower, Chairman profitability.
1 Adjusted pre-tax profit increased 5.4% to 251.4m 2012: 238.5m 1 and earnings per share on the same basis increased by 8.3% to 132.2p 2012: 122.1p, boosted by a lower tax charge.
On an unadjusted basis, pre-tax profit increased 5.0% to 250.1m 2012: 238.3m and earnings per share from continuing operations improved by 7.6% to 131.2p 2012: 121.9p.
Sector Performance Consumer Care sales increased by 1.2% over the year to 593.2m 2012: 586.4m with good growth in Western Europe being the highlight and weak trading in EEMEA together with adverse currency translation in Asia being the major negatives.
Health Care had the highest increase in turnover.
We saw marginal growth in Personal Care whilst in Crop Care, sales for the year as a whole were flat versus 2012 but were much stronger in the second half, reversing the declines seen at the interim stage.
Overall, higher margin NPP sales saw double-digit growth, a 3.2% rise in adjusted 1 operating profit to 191.3m 2012: 185.3m.
The improving quality of our product mix helped increase return on sales to 32.2% 2012: 31.6%.
In Performance Technologies, sales rose by 1.1% to 387.1m 2012: 382.8m with a very strong performance in Asia eroded by declines in EEMEA and Europe.
Again we achieved double-digit NPP 1 growth, supporting an adjusted operating profit increase of 5.9% to 63.0m 2012: 59.5m.
Return on sales improved to 16.3% 2012: 15.5%, representing further progress towards our medium term target of 20%.
All business areas apart from Coatings & Polymers achieved sales growth.
The acquisition of Sichuan Sipo Chemical Co. Ltd Sipo was the main reason behind Industrial Chemicals 16.9% sales increase to 96.7m 2012: 82.7m.
As expected, Sipo made only a small contribution to profit 1 in the second half, and adjusted operating profit for the year was flat at 10.3m 2012: 10.3m.
Consequently, return on sales reduced to 10.7% 2012: 12.5%.
