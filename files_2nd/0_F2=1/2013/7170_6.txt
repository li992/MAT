16 HAYS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 A BUSINESS MODEL FOR A COMPLEX WORLD BALANCED MIX OF TEMPORARY, CONTRACTOR AND PERMANENT BUSINESS Our Group net fees are split 59% temp, 41% perm.
Within this, however, we have three major temp and contractor businesses in the UK & Ireland, Australia & New Zealand and Germany.
Elsewhere, our fees are c. 85% perm, and in the majority of markets they are 100% perm.
Although this adds a degree more cyclicality to the performance of these businesses, it also means that they are highly geared to improvements in economic conditions.
A key strategic priority is to continue to build a balanced business in all markets supportive of a meaningful temp or contractor offering.

WHY OUR MO BUSINESS MODEL IN ACTION OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 17 A BUSINESS MODEL FOR A COMPLEX WORLD BALANCED EXPOSURE TO STRUCTURAL GROWTH AND MATURE MARKETS In most countries, the vast majority of professional recruitment is still done in-house with minimal outsourcing to agencies, even in developed economies such as Germany or Japan.
We have very deliberately built a business model that provides us with a balanced exposure to these high structural growth markets, as well as in more mature markets such as the UK and the USA.
