These include lower consumption per as reducing haulage costs.
Additional ore processed from tonne of electricity and explosives, the latter due to wider development activities at the Jarillas and Mezquite veins veins being mined, as well as optimised shotcreting activities further contributed to increased production.

Gold content in reserves also benefited from better ore grades and increased tonnage.
Total resources in terms of tonnage slightly decreased as a result of the lower prices and higher cut-off grades used in the calculation methodology.
