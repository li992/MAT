Our physical line base We achieved this reduction through efficiency improvements, for example in our back-ofce functions and call centres.
But our service performance was the productivity of our eld engineers by reducing the number of not good enough, affected by the poor weather administrative tasks they have to do and by making better use of theirtime.
Investing for the future Key facts On top of investing in our bre broadband rollout we spent around 190m on our copper network to improve performance and enhance resilience.
Fibre broadband 873,000 new bre coverage now more than We upgraded the IT systems that support our interactions with broadband customers customers and our internal processes.
We also added more hoists to 15mpremises oureet to support heavy-duty engineering work.

This was partially offset by revenue growth from Ethernet, LLU and bre broadband.
Customer service delivery EBITDA increased by 1% 2011 12: 8%, with the decline in revenue Our service delivery was strong in the first quarter but deteriorated for offset by a 3% reduction in net operating costs 2011 12: 1% increase.
the next two quarters following some of the wettest weather on record.
This meant we had to spend more time than expected on repair work.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 4% 2011 12: 7% There were more faults to x and it took longer to put them right.
This reecting the accelerated investment in bre broadband, which also additional work stopped us from delivering new services as quickly as led to capital expenditure increasing by 6% 2011 12: 1% decrease.
Operating profit decreased by 1% 2011 12: 8% increase.
To meet higher levels of demand and improve customer service, we Operating cash ow decreased by 4% 2011 12: 11% increase recruited around 1,600 new engineers.
We also made abig investment primarily due to the higher capital expenditure and timing of in the tools used by our engineers, making them moreproductive.
Thanks to these changes, we were able to carry out 8% more engineer visits in the second half of the year than in the second half of 2011 12.
This meant that by February 2013, our provision lead times were back atthe levels we have committed to.
