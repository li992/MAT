Shortly after the year-end, Lil-lets was sold to a South African buyer with Electra realising 37 million.
Outlook The year to 30 September 2013 has been a year of progress and positive results.
Electra has adapted its investment strategy to market conditions resulting in a record level of new investment at attractive pricing levels.
We expect deal flow to remain strong as a result of a number of influences, including growing momentum in the UK economy, the ongoing restructuring of the banking sector and a reduction in competition from other private equity funds.
Our view is that these influences will generate not only investment opportunities to which Electras flexibility will be well suited, but also a greater number of conventional buyout investment opportunities at more attractive pricing levels than have been seen recently.
With a high level of liquidity, our focus remains on continuing to make attractive new investments, building value in Electras portfolio through organic and inorganic growth, and creating realisation opportunities within the portfolio at the appropriate time.
We continue to believe, in relation to both new investments and realisations, that this is a market where a patient and disciplined approach is likely to be well-rewarded.
