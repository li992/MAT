PROJECTS Development is central to the way we add value through planning, winning space and regeneration.
We are taking advantage of market conditions to raise our activity levels with one major scheme started in 2014 and one more due to start in each of the next two years.
We estimate that 55% of our portfolio is either currently under construction, or earmarked for refurbishment or redevelopment.
Major projects where we are currently on site represent approximately 10% of the portfolio.
2 During 2013 we completed 248,100 sq ft 23,050m of major projects, all of which are fully let and generated a profit on cost 2 of 39%.
We are on site with 586,000 sq ft 54,450m, which is 27% pre-let.
The five new developments underway are expected to achieve a profit on cost of 34%.
In addition, there is the phased refurbishment at 1-2 Stephen Street W1 where 2 we will soon start a 40,000 sq ft 3,720m retail project to be called Tottenham Court Walk.
The first three phases of the 1-2 Stephen Street regeneration are expected to generate a profit on cost of 30%.

100 40 UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS Our quantity surveyors help us determine a fair price 50 20 foreach element of a project.
Based on their extensive database of construction costs in central London, we can 0 0 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 understand in detail what the cost implications of specific design decisions will be.
We can look at the cost versus Major completions value of each design option in isolation, enabling us, Capital expenditure forexample, to judge the merits of adding an extra floor or rationalising the common parts to improve net to grossratio.
Construction costs Our expected construction costs have risen in 2013 through TRANSFERRING RISK a mixture of market forces and design enhancements.
So far Once we have the right design and the right contractor these rising costs have been more than matched by rental inplace, we look to lock in the appropriate level of risk.

For example, the is now largely fixed, but, looking ahead, we expect construction appropriate level of risk to transfer to the contractor for costs to increase further.
This is now much more of a risk than ground conditions would differ depending on whether in the recent past.

We organise regular roundtables with subcontractors to iron out any issues they may have at as early a stage as possible.
NEGOTIATING GOOD AGREEMENTS We have recently signed the construction contract for theWhite Collar Factory with Brookfield Multiplex.
They constructed the prototype live suite and will be using thesame team on the main construction.
We have negotiated a guaranteed maximum price for the scheme without entering into a full tendering process, both cost and time efficient.
