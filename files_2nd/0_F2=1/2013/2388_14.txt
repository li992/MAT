The reservoir is similar in size to Manhattan island and is being developed in stages.
Production from Stage 1 started in 2006.
Stage 2 will open up the Southern Gas Corridor so that gas can be moved directly from Azerbaijan to Europe for the first time, helping to increase the energy security of European markets.
With a total investment of more than $28 billion, this project will involve the construction and integration of activity related to 26 wells, two new platforms and onshore processing and compression facilities.
In 2013 we concluded 25-year sales agreements for more than 10 billion cubic metres per annum bcma to be produced from the Shah Deniz eld as a result of Stage 2 the largest sales contracts in Azerbaijans history.
This adds to existing 2011 agreements to sell 6bcma of gas, meaning that in total, 16bcma of Shah Deniz Stage 2 gas is to be sold in Italy, Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey through some 3,500km of pipelines to Europe.
The agreements came into force following the final investment decision on the project on 17 December 2013.

Saturno, Vnus and Marte PSVM project reached plateau Maximizing value at Mad Dog We continually review the development concepts of our projects to make sure they maximize value for shareholders.
One example of this is Mad Dog Phase 2 in the Gulf of Mexico.
The project builds on the existing Mad Dog development, which is designed to process 80,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic feet of gas per day.
For Phase 2, we originally planned to develop the remaining resource potential of the Mad Dog eld through a large second platform.
However, as we progressed the design and reviewed cost estimates, it became clear that market conditions and industry cost ination made that selected concept less attractive than initially modelled.
As part of our commitment to efficient investments, we reviewed alternative lower-cost development concepts to ensure that we optimize project value and make the best financial choices.
The current concept being considered consists of a subsea development with a single new production host that has been designed for future exibility, allowing capture of additional resource potential.
We continue to review options to further enhance value including simplifying the topsides and subsea design, optimizing the location and number of wells and evaluating the required time to achieve first oil production.
We expect the revised project to show improved economics compared with the previous concept.
We select only the best options that maximize value.

In aggregate, after adjusting for the impact of price movements on our entitlement to production in our PSAs and the effect of acquisitions and disposals, underlying production was 3.2% higher compared with 2012.
This primarily reects new major project volumes in Angola, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.
The group and its equity-accounted entities have numerous long-term sales commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be sourced from supplies available to the group that are not subject to priorities, curtailments or other restrictions.
No single contract or group of related contracts is material to the group.
Gas marketing and trading activities We market and trade natural gas, power and natural gas liquids NGLs.
This provides us with routes into liquid markets for the gas we produce.
It also generates margins and fees from selling physical products and derivatives to third parties, together with income from asset optimization and trading.
The integrated supply and trading function manages the groups trading activities in natural gas, power and NGLs.
This means we have a single interface with the gas trading markets and one consistent set of trading compliance processes, systems and controls.
Gas and power marketing and trading activity is undertaken primarily in the US, Canada and Europe to market both BP production and third-party natural gas, to support group LNG activities and manage market price Discovering gas in India risk, as well as to create incremental trading opportunities through the use of commodity derivative contracts.
