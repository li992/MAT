Valuation movement during the year to 31 March 2013 m Valuation at 31 March 2012 902.0 Investments 278.0 Divestment 5.3 Cash receipts from investments 76.8 195.9 Rebased valuation of the portfolio 1,097.9 Return from the portfolio 97.5 Change in discount rate 21.4 Economic assumptions 5.8 Forex movement on non-UK investments 2.1 115.2 Valuation at 31 March 2013 1,213.1 Allowing for the acquisitions during the year of 278.0m, the divestment of 5.3m Doncaster Schools and investment receipts of 76.8m, the rebased valuation was 1,097.9m.
The growth in the valuation of the portfolio at 31 March 2013 over the rebased value was 10.5%.
This increase is a product of the return from the portfolio, the reduction in the discount rate, the lowering of deposit rate assumptions and UK corporate tax rates, and forex movements.
The return from the portfolio of 97.5m represents a 8.9% increase in the rebased value of the portfolio and includes: The unwinding of the discount rate future cashflows are a year closer and hence more valuable : Value enhancement initiatives from existing investments: Contributions from new investments: Acquisitions made at above the portfolio discount rate: Actual inflation in the year being greater than the 2.75% p. a. valuation assumption: Gain from the disposal.
Fair value for each investment is derived from the application of an appropriate discount rate to the investments future cash flows to give the present value of those cashflows.
We exercise our judgment in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment based on the detailed concession life financial models produced by each Project Company.
These are adjusted where necessary to include the Groups economic assumptions as well as any specific operating assumptions.
Discount Rates The discount rate used for valuing each investment is based on the appropriate long term Government Bond yield and a risk premium.
The risk premium takes into account risks and opportunities associated with the project earnings e. g. predictability and covenant of the concession income, all of which may be differentiated by project phase and market participants appetite for these risks.
The discount rates used for valuing the projects in the portfolio are as follows: Discount rate 31 March 2013 30 September 2012 31 March 2012 Range 8.0% to 10.0% 8.1% to 10.0% 8.2% to 11.0% Weighted average 8.4% 8.5% 8.6% Phase Operational phase 8.4% 8.5% 8.6% Construction phase n a 9.0% 9.0% Portfolio 8.4% 8.5% 8.6% We use our judgement in arriving at the appropriate discount rate.
This is based on our knowledge of the market, taking into account intelligence gained from bidding activities, discussions with financial advisers knowledgeable of these markets and publicly available information on relevant transactions.
The discount rate to reflect market pricing for an operational asset has been judged as 8.4% down 0.2% from the prior year reflecting market conditions discussed in the Market Developments section above.
16 H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2013 An analysis of the weighted average discount rates for the investments in the portfolio analysed by territory is shown below: 31 March 2013 31 March 2012 Movement Discount rate Country Long term Government Risk premium Discount rate Bond yield UK 2.9% 5.5% 8.4% 8.6% 0.2% Canada 2.5% 5.6% 8.1% 8.2% 0.1% Holland 2.4% 6.2% 8.6% 8.8% 0.2% Ireland 5.5% 4.5% 10.0% 11.0% 1.0% Portfolio 2.9% 5.5% 8.4% 8.6% 0.2% The risk premium for each country is derived from the market discount rate for operational social and transportation infrastructure investments less the appropriate long term Government Bond yield.
Long term Government Bond yields in the UK, Canada and Holland are currently low and this is reflected in higher country risk premium, which includes a buffer to allow for increases from these historically low yields.
For the Irish assets, where there is limited transactional evidence, we believe the appropriate discount rate for the operational school projects in which the Group is invested is 10%.
This is also the opinion of the third-party valuation expert appointed by the Board.
An analysis of the movements in the weighted average risk free rate and risk premium for the social and transportation infrastructure assets is shown below: Year ending 31 March 2013 31 March 2012 Movement Government Bond yield 2.9% 3.2% 0.3% Risk premium 5.5% 5.4% 0.1% Discount rate 8.4% 8.6% 0.2% Long term Government Bond yields have continued to trend lower over the year as the authorities use all means at their disposal to try and stimulate economic growth.
However, as in previous years we have not reduced our discount rate to the same extent, as investors in the social and transportation infrastructure market believe Government Bond yields are artificially low as a result of government intervention and other factors, and yields will return to more normalised levels in due course.
The discount rate therefore reduces this potential short term volatility and, all other factors being equal, could accommodate a material rise in yields before the discount rate would need to rise.
The 0.2% reduction is attributable to a more competitive environment for social infrastructure assets.
While there is a steady supply of new investment opportunities, new market entrants, attracted by the favourable risk-adjusted returns, have had a small upward impact on pricing, and hence caused a slight reduction in discount rates during the year.
H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2013 17 Investment Advisers Report continued Valuation Assumptions Discount Rate Sensitivity The discount rates used to derive the Directors valuation is a key judgement, based on the knowledge of the Investment Adviser and the third party advice which the Board receives on the valuation.
As in previous years, the Company prepares certain valuation sensitivities including changing the weighted average discount rate.
A change to the weighted average rate of 8.4% by plus or minus 0.5% has the following effect on the valuation: Discount rate -0.5% change Base 8.4% 0.5% change Directors valuation 58.4m 1,213.1m -54.1m 1 Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share 5.2p share -4.8p share 1.
NAV per share based on 1,116m Ordinary Shares as at 31 March 2013 Discount Rate Sensitivity Inflation Rate Sensitivity 1,300m 1,400m 1,260m 1,350m 1,300m 1,220m 1,213.1m 1,250m 1,213.1m 1,180m 1,200m 1,140m 1,150m 1,100m 1,100m -1.0% -0.5% Base 2.75% 0.5% 1.0% Sensitivity changing assumption each and every year to maturity 1,050m Sensitivity changing assumption for next five years only -1.0% -0.5% Base 8.4% 0.5% 1.0% base case thereafter Inflation Rate Sensitivity The projects in the portfolio have contractual income streams with public sector clients, which are rebased every year for inflation.
UK projects tend to use either RPI Retail Price Index or RPIx RPI excluding mortgage payments, and revenues are either partially or totally indexed depending on the contract and the nature of the projects financing.
Facilities management sub-contracts have similar indexation arrangements.
The portfolio valuation assumes UK inflation of 2.75% per annum for both RPI and RPIx, the same assumption as for the prior year.
The March 2013 forecasts for RPI out to December 2014 range from 1.7% to 4.0% from 25 independent forecasters as compiled by HM Treasury, with an average forecast of 3.0%.
As mentioned by the Chairman, during the year the Office for National Statistics ONS undertook a consultation on the method of calculation of RPI and RPIx inflation in the UK.
While not directed at the infrastructure sector, a change in the calculation methodology could have had a one-off adverse impact on the value of the Groups portfolio.
In February 2013, the ONS announced that its consultation had concluded that so many aspects of the financial services industry would have been unduly impacted by such a change that no change should be made to the calculation methodology and that RPI would continue to be measured and reported as before.
This outcome is clearly positive for the sector and for the Company.
A change of 0.5% p. a. to the assumed inflation rate of 2.75% p. a. would have the following effect on the valuation: Inflation assumption UK -0.5% p. a. change Base 2.75% p. a.
0.5% p. a. change Directors valuation -34.2m 1,213.1m 36.9m 1 Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -3.1p share 3.3p share 1.
NAV per share based on 1,116m Ordinary Shares as at 31 March 2013 Changing the assumption for future inflation by a 1.0% p. a. increase i. e. from 2.75% p. a. to 3.75% p. a. for the UK investments has the effect of increasing the forecast return from the portfolio from 8.4% being the weighted average discount rate to 9.0%.
18 H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2013 Deposit Rate Sensitivity Deposit Rate Sensitivity Each projects interest costs are at fixed rates, either through fixed 1,270m rate bonds or bank debt which is hedged with an interest rate swap, or linked to inflation through index-linked bonds.
A projects 1,250m sensitivity to interest rates relates to the cash deposits which the project is required to maintain as part of its senior debt funding.
For 1,230m example most projects would have a debt service reserve account in 1,213.1m which 6 months of debt service payments are held.
1,210m As at 31 March 2013 cash deposits for the portfolio were earning 1,190m interest at a rate of 0.4% per annum on average.
There is a consensus that UK base rates will remain low for an extended period, 1,170m with a current median forecast for UK base rates in December 2014 of 0.5%.
1,150m -1.0% -0.5% Base 0.5% 1.0% 1% then 3.5% The portfolio valuation assumes UK deposit interest rates are 1% to March 2017 and 3.50% thereafter.
This is lower than applied in the March 2012 valuation, which assumed 1% deposit interest rates to March 2015 and 3.75% thereafter.
These changes have reduced the portfolio valuation by approximately 11.9m and are included within the 5.8m aggregate reduction in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic assumptions.
A change of 0.5% p. a. to the assumed deposit rates would have the following effect on the valuation: Cash deposit rate -0.5% p. a. change Base 1.0% p. a. then 3.5% p. a.
0.5% p. a. change Directors valuation -15.3m 1,213.1m 16.3m 1 Implied change in NAV per Ordinary Share -1.4p share 1.5p share 1.
NAV per share based on 1,116m Ordinary Shares as at 31 March 2013 Tax Rates The profits of each UK project company are subject to UK corporation tax.
On 1 April 2013 the prevailing rate of corporation tax reduced from 24% to 23%.
In the 2013 Budget Statement the Chancellor announced the Governments intention to bring UK corporation tax down to 20%, reducing the rate in April 2014 to 21% and by a further 1% the following year.
The UK corporation tax assumption for the portfolio valuation is 23%, which has reduced by 1% from 24% at March 2012, to reflect the current rate of UK corporation tax.
This change has increased the portfolio valuation by approximately 6.1m and is included within the 5.8m aggregate change in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic assumptions.
H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2013 19 Investment Advisers Report continued Future Cashflows The chart below sets out the expected future cashflows to be received by the Group from the portfolio as at 31 March 2013 and how the portfolio valuation is expected to evolve over time using current forecasts and assumptions.
Long term income phase Capital repayment phase 300.0 1,500.0 275.0 The valuation of the portfolio at any time is a function 250.0 2,3 1,250.0 of the present value of the expected future cash flows 225.0 200.0 1,000.0 175.0 150.0 750.0 125.0 100.0 500.0 75.0 50.0 250.0 25.0 0 0 -25.0 -50.0 -250.0 Year ending 31 March Subdebt interest Subdebt principal Dividends Subdebt obligations Fees Portfolio valuation RHS Source: Investment Adviser 1.
The chart represents a target only and is not a profit forecast.
There can be no assurance that this target will be met.
Portfolio valuation assumes a Euro to Sterling exchange rate of 0.84, a Canadian Dollar to Sterling Exchange rate of 0.65 and a weighted average discount rate of 8.4% per annum.
These assumptions and the valuation of the current portfolio may vary over time.
The cashflows and the valuation are from the portfolio of 79 investments as at 31 March 2013 and does not include other assets or liabilities of the Group, and assumes that during the period illustrated above, i no new investments are purchased, ii no existing investments are sold and iii the Group suffers no material liability to withholding taxes, or taxation on income or gains.
