At the same time there has been no change in the investment strategy which has been in place since the appointment of Invesco as Manager in September 2008, and which has delivered strong investment out-performance against Jim Pettigrew benchmark in the 12 month period to 31 March 2013.
More detail on performance is given below.
The income generation of the portfolio remains good and the Board is proposing a final dividend of 7.8 pence per share for the three months to 31 March 2013 which would result in a full year dividend of 22.8 pence per share, an increase of 3.6% year-on-year.
UK Equity Market Since June 2012 the UK equity market has performed very strongly, in part due to continuing monetary stimuli, but also as a consequence of a low interest rate environment reducing the attractiveness of many other investment assets.
Some fundamental challenges remain in place for financial markets in general, including concerns over austerity measures and the lack of economic growth stimuli in many western economies, oil price worries around political instability in the Middle East, and the ongoing Eurozone debt and banking crisis.
A more detailed discussion on the UK equity market and the Companys portfolio is contained in the Managers Report.
Investment Strategy Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Board and the Manager have been consistent in their view that the recovery of the global economy was likely to be slower than the markets had anticipated, with a longer period of lower growth rates in the developed world being a distinct possibility.
The central theme behind the construction of the Companys investment portfolio is the selection of individual stocks based upon fundamental value.
This approach is designed to be resilient in the continuing difficult economic environment, whilst at the same time providing opportunity to participate in long term growth by offering fundamental value through earnings and dividend growth.
This investment approach has remained in place for nearly five years, including the current year.
Performance for the Year The Company produced a NAV total return for the year to 31 March 2013 of 21.1% debt at par and of 22.4% debt at market value, which compares with a total return of 16.8% for the FTSE All-Share Index the Index, the Companys benchmark.
The portfolio is concentrated in a relatively small number of sectors and its overweight position in the pharmaceutical sector and the underweight position in the mining sector have been material drivers of the Companys investment out-performance in the year.
The Company produced a share price total return share price with dividends reinvested of 20.1%, which compares to the Indexs total return of 16.8%.
The discount of the share price to NAV debt at par increased from 0.9% at 31 March 2012 to 1.7% at 31 March 2013: valuing debt at market, the shares traded at a premium of 2.3%, a decrease from 4.0% at 31 March 2012.
Performance Fee A performance fee is payable in respect of each three year rolling period in which the Company outperforms its benchmark index plus a hurdle of 1.25% pa.
This fee is capped at 1% of the period end net assets, before deduction of any performance fee.
As a result of the Companys very strong performance over three years producing a total return of 56.7% against the Index total return of 28.7%, a capped performance fee of 11.5 million is due.
Gearing The Company continues to have long-term debt amounting to 200 million in the form of two 100 million debentures.
This debt is fully deployed for investment purposes.
As a result of the THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 07 appreciation in NAV over the year, at 31 March 2013 the gross gearing level was 17.6% compared to 20.4% at 31 March 2012.
One of the debentures, the 11.5% 100 million debenture, matures in June 2014.
The Board continues to keep this position under review, both in terms of whether and how best to replace the financing represented by that debenture.
Dividend Income from the portfolio during the year was 52.9 million 2012 52.9 million.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 7.8 pence per share which, if approved at the AGM, will be paid on 31 July 2013 to shareholders on the Companys register on 14 June 2013.
This would result in a total dividend for the year to 31 March 2013 of 22.8 pence compared to 22.0 pence in the prior year, an increase of 3.6% compared to a rise in the Retail Prices Index of 3.3%, and demonstrates the Companys commitment to its long term objective of providing income growth which exceeds the rate of inflation.
Retail Distribution Review RDR RDR came into effect on 31 December 2012 and has significant implications for the way financial advice is provided, retail fund platforms operate and financial products are distributed.
It remains too early to draw final conclusions about how RDR will play out for Investment Trusts.
Many commentators continue to suggest that the abolition of commission under RDR should result in more demand by individual investors for Investment Trusts, with the likely beneficiaries of this demand being the larger Investment Trusts such as The Edinburgh Investment Trust which have good levels of liquidity in their own shares and can demonstrate a strong investment track record, a clear investment strategy and a compelling brand.
The Board is continuing to monitor external developments in the market for financial investments as they evolve to ensure that the Company is positioned appropriately to benefit in the new environment.
Board Following Will Samuels retirement from the Board in December 2012 and Nicola Ralstons forthcoming retirement after the AGM in July, I am pleased to be able to announce two new appointments to the Board: Vicky Hastings and Glen Suarez.
Vicky has nearly 25 years experience in the investment management industry and is a non-executive director of Henderson Global Trust plc and Impax Environmental Markets plc.
Her roles have included investment director at JO Hambro Capital Management: chief investment officer, private clients at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers London : a fund manager in the Merrill Lynch European Equity team: and non-executive director of Charter European Trust.
Glen is Deputy CEO of Knight Vinke Asset Management.
Prior to joining Knight Vinke, he was a Partner in Soditic Limited and before that he was Head of European Utilities at Morgan Stanley.
He is a specialist in the banking and energy sectors and is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.
I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Will and Nicola for their very valuable contribution to the Board over many years.
We wish them well for the future.
Outlook With markets having risen against a cautious backdrop, there is always the potential for a disconnect between the equity markets and economic fundamentals.
Against this background, the Board and the Manager see no reason to change the Companys current investment approach of focussing on stock selection based on fundamental value.
As has been the case in recent years, the relatively concentrated nature of the portfolio may from time to time result in material short term performance deviations from benchmark.
However, the Board and the Manager continue to believe that in the present market environment our current investment approach should give some resilience whilst still providing the opportunity for creating growth in shareholder value over the longer term.
