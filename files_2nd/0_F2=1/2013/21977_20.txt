EBITDA is dened as the group profit before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is dened as EBITDA before specic items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash ow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash ow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
