The PSP awards to be granted in 2014 will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition for onethird of the award and earnings per share growth targets for twothirds of the award as follows: Average annual adjusted Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the EPS growth excluding the unwind of the discount rate unwind of the discount rate TSR relative to the FTSE 51 to 150 Note i in excess of RPI Note ii in excess of RPI Note ii % of one third % of one third % of one third of award Performance of award Performance of award Performance level hurdle Performance required vesting required vesting required vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Stretch or above Upper Quartile or above 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% Notes: i FTSE 51 to 150, excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas producers and mining sectors.
Straight line vesting occurs in between threshold and maximum vesting.
ii The first EPS performance condition is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The effect of the adjustment to the consolidated after tax figures will be to strip out the post tax EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change in the final year of the performance period as these factors are not within the control of management and can produce wide variations to reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
However, this measure of EPS is still impacted by stock market movements in the prior year due to the impact of any such movements on the unwind of the discount rate in the current year.
The second EPS performance condition is calculated in a similar way to the first EPS condition, save that a further adjustment is made to strip out the impact of the unwind of the discount rate.
This adjustment eliminates any direct impact of stock market volatility and changes in the economic assumptions throughout the whole threeyear period of the performance condition.
