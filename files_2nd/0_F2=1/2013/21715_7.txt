Despite below average returns recently, BlueCrest believes that its inherent approach and investment techniques remain effective.
AllBlue retains an admirable track record with average returns of 8.9% since its inception in 2006.
Reflecting the net impact of the investment performance and other movements in the net asset value, including the partial redemption of the US Dollar Share Class, the assets under management of the Company decreased in 2013 from 958.3 million to 841.5 million.
DISCOUNT MANAGEMENT We recognise that the returns from the Companys holding in AllBlue is only one part of the story for Shareholders.
The Board is very aware of the impact upon Shareholders of any variability in the Share price against the net asset value.
As a result, we have continued to be active in repurchasing Shares at a discount to net asset value.
During 2013, the Company repurchased 47.7m worth of Sterling Shares at an average discount of approximately 4.5%.
The effect of the share repurchases at a discount during 2013 was an increase in the net asset value per share of 0.4779 pence.
As a Board, we recognise that being willing to repurchase Shares when the price is at a discount is as important as issuance when at a premium.
We are pleased that the discount has been relatively stable during the year at around 4%.
