This was against a particularly strong 2012 comparator and amidst a weaker overall market for its authorised programmes, particularly Tay and TFE731.
In the first half of the year ERO implemented a sales organisation restructuring, which resulted in some short-term disruption and loss of market share.
Whilst we are seeing the broader benefits of the sales force restructuring and there was some recovery in the third quarter, demand for Tay overhauls in particular was weaker than anticipated in the fourth quarter and is expected to remain subdued in 2014.
ERO continues to focus on improving operational efficiency and expanding its global field support organisation through its F1RST SUPPORT network.
Additionally, ERO launched a mobile app for customers to track work in progress.
ERO added the Honeywell RE220 auxiliary power unit APU line authorisation, bolstering its field service portfolio for Gulfstream and Bombardier long-range aircraft.
In early 2014, ERO signed an authorisation with Woodward to handle the maintenance, repair and overhaul for PT6 and TPE331 Fuel Controls & Governors, and signed agreements to be authorised maintenance repair and overhaul centres for the RR300, which powers the rapidly growing fleet of Robinson R66 helicopters.
EROs investments in 2012 began to deliver benefits with an increased inflow of field repair work on the Bombardier Challenger 300 and Gulfstream G280 business jets as a result of the Consolidated Turbine Services acquisition and the first series of on-field engine removals for the BR710 turbofan engine following the authorisation from Rolls-Royce CorporateCare for mobile repair support and a steady flow of engine inputs following the agreement signed with GE Aviation to handle all engine care and maintenance programme commercial shop visits for the CT7-5A and -9B engines used on Saab 340 aircraft.
In late May, EROs Singapore Regional Turbine Centre RTC completed its first Honeywell TFE731 Major Periodic Inspection MPI, the first of several engines to be serviced at the facility.
The Singapore RTC is the only Honeywell authorised facility in the region and also houses a F1RST SUPPORT centre.

Over the course of the next two years we will therefore be and overhaul undertaking a phased rationalisation of our ERO footprint, transitioning products to existing Dallas, Texas facilities and to a new facility to be constructed in the Dallas Fort Worth area.
The total cash cost of the project is expected to amount to $16 million, with annualised savings of $10 million, which are expected to begin to accrue from mid-2014.
Total exceptional Day 01 charges of $11 million are expected to be incurred over the life of the project which is likely A Honeywell TFE731 engine is to be more than offset by exceptional gains on the disposal of APPH.
