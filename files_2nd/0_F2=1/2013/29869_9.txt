In this bottom-up portfolio OUTLOOK FOR EMERGING MARKETS construction, we are nevertheless mindful of what is Emerging market equities have provided outstanding long-term happening in the wider economy.
BRIC economies currently performance against developed markets.
The major factor underpinning our confidence in emerging markets is their appear out-of-favour with investors.
However, we believe that their economies generally have remained healthier than much higher rates of growth in GDP when compared with developed markets.
We believe that this growth has become those of many developed countries and thus could increasingly self-sustaining as levels of trade with emerging outperform in the longer term.
It also should be noted that markets start to dominate overall trading patterns and rising within the constituent members of the BRIC economies consumer wealth within the emerging market economies there were notable differences in growth in the last year.

In terms of our investment strategy, we continue to invest with The Brazilian economy grew 0.9% in 2012 despite the a long-term horizon in companies that we believe are implementation of stimulus measures and record-low interest undervalued, fundamentally strong and growing.

Brazilian real led to the MSCI Brazil Index losing 8% in sterling terms, making it the worst BRIC performer for the year ended March 2013.
The Russian stock market, which is heavily dependent on commodities, was adversely affected by lower oil and metal prices, weaker investor confidence and a depreciating ruble.
Valuations, however, remain extremely attractive at a low single digit price to earnings ratio, making it one of the cheapest markets in the global investment universe.
While the Indian Governments unexpected announcement of a series of reforms boosted investor confidence in equities in the latter part of 2012, reduced economic growth forecasts, persistent high inflation and a lack of hoped-for commitments to economic reform in the state budget led investors to shun the market in early 2013.
At the other end of the spectrum, China was the strongest BRIC performer as solid economic growth and a recovery in exports and industrial production helped equity prices.
The implementation of tightening measures in the property sector and higher inflation, however, led Chinese equities to end off their year high.
