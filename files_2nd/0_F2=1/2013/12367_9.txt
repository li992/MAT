Annual Report 2013 Polymetal International plc Strategic report 32 33 Strategic report Operating review continued Despite initial mechanical and metallurgical problems in the omolon continued ramp-up, the Amursk POX plant successfully achieved design AmuRsk poX throughput and recovery by October 2013.
This was a definitive mines strategic milestone for us: Polymetal now possesses a unique Birkachan Sopka Oroch Tsokol Dalneye Prognoz Total competitive advantage in the Former Soviet Union, enabling us to target untapped refractory gold deposits across the Status Operating Operating Pre-feasibility Operating Development Feasibility region through both exploration and acquisitions.

Then, during a six-week shutdown the Inconel parts susceptible to corrosion were replaced with more resistant 2014 pRioRities parts made from titanium.
The replacement allowed the plant In 2014, at current market prices, we will continue Russia, Khabarovsk Territory to quickly ramp-up to the design concentrate throughput, to operate under the revised mine plans at Omolon.
Managing Director: Viktor Nikitanov along with improvement in recoveries to 87% in Q3 compared The Birkachan open pit is expected to be put on Employees: 330 to 75% in Q1.
In Q3, the POX plant produced 59 Koz of gold permanent care and maintenance in Q3 2014 after at an average throughput of 444 tonnes per day.

The decision on the timing unit in Q3, full design recoveries were achieved in October.
Concentrate processed POX recovery achieved and other parameters of underground mining at Birkachan In Q4 the Amursk POX plant delivered a full quarter of stable at the Amursk POX in Q4 2013 is expected to be made in Q4 2014 following the performance at the design parameters in terms of both completion of in-fill drilling.
Gold production was 59 Koz in Q4 while average recovery reached 93%.
A further The total amount of ore trucked by winter road from optimisation programme is now in place to ensure continuous 159 Koz Open-pit mining at Sopka Sopka and Dalneye to the Kubaka mill is expected improvements in the recovery and cost profile of the operation.
Total gold production to increase to 400 Kt in 2014 and support the overall Currently, the plant is running at 500 tonnes per day, exceeding in 2013 grade level in ore processed.
its nameplate capacity for Albazino concentrate, with the goal to fast-track processing of accumulated stockpiles.
In 2013, the successful ramp-up process at the Amursk POX plant and related concentrate fide-stockpiling contributed significantly to the increased gold production at Albazino Amursk, which totalled 238 Koz and exceeded original Mines Nikolaevskproduction guidance.
