Directors Report Illustrations of application of the Remuneration Policy The charts illustrate the composition and value of the different elements of remuneration that the Executive Directors will receive for below threshold, target and maximum corporate performance.
The graphs show an estimate of the remuneration that could be received by Executive Directors under the Policy set out in this Report.
Each of the bars is broken down to show how the total under each scenario is made up of fixed elements of remuneration, the annual bonus and share-based incentives.
The charts indicate that a significant proportion of both target and stretch pay is performance-related.
For target performance variable pay accounts for nearly two-thirds of total pay for the Acting Group Chief Executive, and over half for the Group Chief Financial Officer.
