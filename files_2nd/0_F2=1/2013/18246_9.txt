The project is now scheduled to complete in August 2013 and tenant marketing is about to commence.
This years professional revaluation has confirmed a significant uplift in the value of this property.
We continue actively to explore potential development opportunities within our property portfolio with a view to enhancing rental income and thereby capital values.

In addition to several smaller development projects which are currently under way, we are considering a number of more significant schemes which I would hope to be able to report on in subsequent years.
