62 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 Implementation Report Our approach to Reward The Remuneration Committee adopts an approach which has a strong emphasis on variable pay.
Our approach has been to manage fixed costs tightly and encourage use of deferrals which are then linked closely to performance related measures and thus aligning long-term goals with interests of shareholders.
Total remuneration will comprise basic salary, pension provision, annual bonus and any awards under the long-term incentive schemes.
# Annual Bonus includes the AESOP Award.
