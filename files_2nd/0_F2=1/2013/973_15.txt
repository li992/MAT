In operation since 1973, the Boa Vista mine produces and exports approximately 4,500 tonnes of Brazil, a major agricultural nation, is the fourth largest niobium per year.
With the end of its weathered ore reserves phosphate market globally and needs to import almost approaching, Niobium is investing in adapting the existing 50% of its phosphate fertilisers.
