The holes confirmed the steeply underlain by tightly folded limestones and clastic sediments which have been intruded by a number of intrusive rocks from mafic to felsic in composition.
The target area is covered by transported alluvial gravels from the adjacent Falm River which not only masks the underlying geology but also the surface geochemical response from mineralisation.
Ferruginous shears have returned encouraging mineralised intersections in trenches: GST01 - 15.0 metres at 5.46g t: and GST02 - 17.9 metres at 2.91g t including 10.2 metres at 4.55g t. Subsequent RC drilling beneath the trench and along strike, over 800 metres, returned weaker results than anticipated with a best gold intersection of 15.0 metres at 1.32g t. Detailed logging has revealed a complex pattern of shears and folds, with fold hinges plunging to the southwest at 30 degrees.
Mineralisation identified to date is associated with brecciated and altered sediments as well as porphyry intrusions.
Further exploration will be undertaken in 2014 to determine the potential economic viability of the target.
