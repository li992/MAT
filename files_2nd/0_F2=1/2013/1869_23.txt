Strategic Report Aftermarket Services Legacy Support Leading supplier of OEM licensed legacy products Revenue 2013 2012 Inc dec $m $m % USA 105.3 93.9 12% Europe & ROW 62.9 53.4 18% Total 168.2 147.3 14% Performance Legacy Supports revenue increased by 14% to $168.2 million 2012: $147.3 million, the majority of which was organic.
Sales were driven by the substantial completion of large contracts for landing gear shock strut assemblies for the AH-64 Apache, and LANTIRN environmental control units for the F-15, together with strong demand for Airbus 320 and B777 fuel gauging system upgrades, and significant sales for landing gear cylinder assemblies for the EA-6B Prowler to the US government.
Organic revenue growth was 15%, although substantial completion of these larger contracts resulted in a decrease in backlog of 14% year over year.
In the first half of 2013, Legacy Support successfully transferred the product lines and staff from its facility in Slough, UK to its Cheltenham, UK facility.
A regional base was also established in Singapore, co-located with EROs regional turbine centre, to provide component and accessory spares and MRO services in-region.
Additionally, Legacy successfully transitioned two new product lines from licence agreements signed in December 2012 into its Cheltenham and Chatsworth facilities, further proving Legacys successful adoption and transition process.
Legacy Support extended its OEM relationships and grew its portfolio of products under licence in 2013, signing three new licence agreements with Curtiss-Wright Controls and two new licences with Safran Power Systems.
