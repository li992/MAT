Pensions and investments new business income increased slightly with a strong performance in corporate pensions being largely offset by reduced investments volumes following the Groups decision to stop providing investment advice to retail customers with savings below 100,000. existing business income increased by 32 million largely due to increased income from protection and annuities which benefited from the increased returns on higher yielding assets.
Pensions and investments existing business income increased slightly with increased income in pensions being largely offset by reduced income on the declining savings and investments portfolio.
underlying profit in the protection and annuities business included a benefit of 302 million largely as a result of changes to long-term mortality and investment return assumptions which included the benefits of investing in higher yielding assets to match long duration liabilities.
This was partly offset by a charge of 158 million in the pensions and investments business driven primarily by a revision of pensions lapse assumptions and allowance for the impact of the Office of Fair Trading review on fairness of legacy pension charges.
General Insurance income reduced by 115 million to 457 million primarily due to a 77 million impact of a revised commission arrangement with Retail on the home insurance portfolio in addition to the continued run off of legacy books.
Operating cash generation In line with emerging industry practice we have introduced an operating cash generation reporting metric.
Operating cash is used to fund new business generating future cash, to pay dividends to Group, or is retained within the business to provide security for policyholders and achieve our strategic objectives.
For the majority of products writing new business results in an outflow of cash for new business origination and set up costs including commission.
This cash outflow is recouped in subsequent years.
However some products, where the policyholders initial investment covers the cost of setting up the policy, do not require new business funding.
Operating cash generation is derived from underlying profit by removing the effect of movements in intangible non-cash items and assumption changes.
Intangible items include the value of in-force life business, deferred acquisition costs and deferred income reserves.

The reduction was due to the change in intra group commission arrangements, the run-off of the legacy creditor book, and a slight increase in cash invested in new business, largely due to lower protection new business income.
The increase in intangibles is driven by the beneficial impact of assumption changes.

Group Operations supports the Group by providing high quality services and delivering investment project capability through Information Technology IT, Operations including Customer Service and Global Payments as well as Property and Sourcing.
Achieving excellent service availability and high standards is a key part of our strategy to be the best bank for customers.
Incremental cost savings of 6 per cent have been achieved through Simplification and tight cost control actions such as sourcing, the centralisation, automation and re-engineering of end-to-end processes, and consolidation and rationalisation of property and IT.
These savings are offset by higher costs of supplying investment projects and the impact of regulatory costs and inflation.
Information Technology savings were offset by increased costs from delivering Group Strategic Initiatives, such as Transaction Banking Transformation and Digital Transformation, which generate income and cost benefits in other Divisions.
Operations costs increased slightly from 2012 to 2013 with enhancements to our customer services processes and regulatory and compliance activities, in areas such as Global Payments, offset by Simplification savings.
This includes delivering Industry Accounts Switchers, Global Anti Money laundering and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act projects serving the rest of the Group.
Group Property costs decreased by 2 per cent as we continued to consolidate the Groups property portfolio with savings offsetting the costs of rebranding the Branch network.
We continue to streamline our internal operations and have reduced the number of suppliers by a further 1,467 this year, bringing the total down from over 18,000 at the start of Simplification to 9,066, well ahead of our original target of 10,000 by the end of 2014.
