Awards of performance shares with a market value of 200% of salary, vesting of half of which is subject to a relative TSR performance condition measured against the constituents of the FTSE-250 index excluding investment trusts and vesting of half of which is subject to an EPS performance condition measured against a retail price index related target, will be awarded shortly.
No awards will be granted under the Matching Share Plan in the coming financial year.
The share ownership guideline for executive directors was increased from 100% to 200% of annual salary.
Together with the Group Chairman, I consulted with major shareholders prior to the Committees nalisation of the decisions above and received broad support.
The most important challenge for the Committee will be to continue to ensure that the remuneration policy remains appropriately structured to retain and motivate executive directors, whilst providing alignment with shareholders and, most importantly, directly linking to the achievement of the Companys strategy.
I commend this report to shareholders and ask you to support the resolutions to approve the Companys forward looking Remuneration Policy Report and the annual report on remuneration for the year ended 30 September 2013 at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
ALAN K FLETCHER Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 26 November 2013 B3.2 Policy report The information provided in this part of the Directors Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.
Introduction This part of the report sets out the directors remuneration policy to apply from the Annual General Meeting to be held on 6 February 2014 and which will be subject to a binding vote by shareholders during that meeting.
The policy, once approved, will apply until the Annual General Meeting in 2017, unless revised by a vote of shareholders ahead of that time.
Following a review of all aspects of the policy on executive directors remuneration policy during the year ended 30 September 2012 and the resulting changes to the performance metrics used for subsequent awards of LTIs, no further changes of policy are proposed for the year ending 30 September 2014.
In setting the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the Committee takes into account: The need to attract, retain and motivate high quality executive directors to ful l the Companys strategy: The maintenance of a clear link between rewards and company performance: The objective of achieving an appropriate mix of xed and variable pay: The views of our investors and shareholder bodies: The requirement to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code : The need to encourage management to adopt a level of risk which is in line with the risk appetite of the business as approved by the Board: The need to ensure a long-term focus through the deferral of part of the annual bonus and the requirement for executive directors to maintain a signi cant level of investment in the Companys shares: Annual Report & Accounts 2013 39 B Corporate governance B3.2 Policy report continued Pay and bene t practice within the Group and within the sector: and Periodic peer group comparisons.
Contractual commitments already made to directors will continue to be honoured as part of this policy.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman and executive directors The Companys policy is to ensure that the executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual performance, having regard to the importance of retention and motivation.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
The Committee also sets the salary for the Chairman, taking account of his performance and time commitment in the role.
In forming and reviewing remuneration policy the Committee has given full consideration to the Code and has complied with its provisions relating to directors remuneration throughout the year.
Moreover, the Committee has given due regard to the link between remuneration and strategy, seeking to ensure that the remuneration structures in place do not encourage excessive risk or activities that are not in line with the agreed strategy.
The remuneration packages of the individual directors are assessed after a review of their individual performances and an assessment of comparable positions in the financial sector and within a group of pan-sectoral comparators comprising a number of FTSE-250 companies with market capitalisations similar to the Groups, there now being no directly comparable financial services businesses in the UK.
The Committee pays due regard to the levels of remuneration within the Group when determining the remuneration of executive directors and other senior employees.
It also seeks to ensure that the incentive structure for senior management does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Key aspects of the remuneration policy for executive directors The executive directors receive a combination of xed and performance-related elements of remuneration.
Fixed remuneration consists of salary, bene ts in kind and pension scheme contributions see under Pension contributions below.
Performance-related remuneration consists of participation in the annual bonus plan, the award of shares under the PSP and invitations to participate in the award of shares under the MSP from time to time.
The performance-related elements of remuneration are intended to provide a signi cant proportion of executive directors potential total remuneration.

The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 44 B Corporate governance Key aspects of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and non-executive directors The Chairman receives a salary, a company car or cash alternative and is eligible for private health cover for himself and his family in the same way as the executive directors.
Non-executive directors are remunerated solely by fees.
Neither the Chairman nor the non-executive directors are eligible to participate in any of the Companys incentive or pension schemes and they are not entitled to receive compensation for early termination of their terms of engagement.
Bene ts may also be provided to non-executive directors related to the performance of their duties e. g. travel and hospitality.

Remuneration committee exibility, discretion and judgement The Committee operates the variable incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC rules where relevant.
To ensure the ef cient administration of these plans the Committee has certain operational powers.
These include the determination of: The participants of the plans on an annual basis: The timing of grant of award and or payment: The quantum of an award and or a payment within the limits set in the policy table above : The extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance: Annual Report & Accounts 2013 45 B Corporate governance B3.2 Policy report continued Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. change of control, rights issues, corporate restructuring, events and special dividends : Good bad leaver status for incentive plan purposes and the appropriate treatment chosen: and The annual performance measures weighting, and targets for the annual bonus plan, PSP and MSP from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus or LTI performance conditions and or targets being deemed no longer appropriate i. e. a material acquisition or divestment then the Committee will have the ability to adjust the measures and or targets and alter weightings so that the conditions are not materially less dif cult to satisfy.
Illustrations of the application of the remuneration policy The chart below illustrates the remuneration opportunity provided to each executive director at different levels of performance for the coming year: 2500 37% PSP Bonus Total xed 2000 35% 37% 1500 17% 36% 36% 35% 34% 16% 1000 32% 36% 36% 17% 17% 100% 50% 27% 33% 33% 53% 100% 29% 500 100% 50% 27% 100% 50% 27% 0 Min Target Max Min Target Max Min Target Max Min Target Max 652 1,317 2,424 552 1,050 1,880 352 706 1,296 353 707 1,297 N S Terrington N Keen J A Heron R J Woodman The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 46 B Corporate governance 000 In developing the above scenarios the following assumptions have been used: Total xed pay is based on the latest salary, bene ts and pension allowances including both the accrual under the fide ned bene t scheme and the cash supplement, with the amounts being calculated on a basis consistent with those shown in the single total gure of remuneration table for the year ended 30 September 2013.

Annual bonuses pay out at 50% of the maximum for on-target performance.
At median performance PSP awards would vest at 25%.
Maximum is based on 100% of the annual bonus and 100% vesting of the PSP awards.
No share price appreciation has been included in the above analysis.
As Sharesave awards are provided on an all employee basis they have not been included in the above analysis.
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting The choice of the performance measures applicable to the annual bonus scheme re ect the Committees belief that incentives should be appropriately challenging and tied to the achievement of both forward and backward-looking financial objectives, risk metrics and speci c individual objectives linked to the Companys strategy.
The Committee reviews the measures each year and varies them as appropriate to re ect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
A sliding scale of targets is set for each measure to encourage continuous improvement and challenge the delivery of above-target performance.
The PSP and MSP are subject to a combination of relative TSR and EPS growth measures.
EPS is considered appropriate as the activities of the Company in developing its new lending and other income streams should result in improvements to pro tability and including a pro t measure such as EPS will be re ective of long term performance.
It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers shareholder value creation and is a measure of market expectations of future performance.
The use of relative TSR and EPS growth in the LTIs provides a combined focus on the Groups financial performance and shareholder value creation.
Targets for EPS are set by reference to internal budgeting plans and external market expectations.
TSR targets are set on a standard practice, median to upper quartile ranking range.
Only 25% of the award is payable for threshold levels of performance.
Policy on recruitment and promotion Salaries for newly recruited directors will be set to re ect their skills and experience, the Companys intended pay positioning and the market rate for the role.
If it is considered appropriate to appoint a new director on a below market salary for example, to allow the director to gain experience in the role the individuals salary may be increased to a market level by way of a series of above in ation increases over two to three years, subject to their performance and development in the role.
A new appointment would be offered bene ts comparable to existing directors, as well as other reasonable expenses such as legal, tax equalisation and relocation costs if necessary on a net of tax basis.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 47 B Corporate governance B3.2 Policy report continued A new external appointment might be invited to participate in the fide ned bene t scheme on the same terms as those offered to existing directors.
Alternatively a cash supplement may be offered to new appointments.
The prevailing maximum bonus opportunity for existing directors will not be exceeded for any newly recruited director and would be pro-rated to re ect the proportion of the year worked.
It may be necessary to set different performance measures and targets initially, dependent on the timing of the appointment and the nature of the role taken up.
Guaranteed bonuses will not be offered.
LTI awards will be granted in line with the policy outlined for existing directors, with the same maximum opportunity for any newly recruited director.
Awards may be granted shortly after an appointment subject to the Company not being in a prohibited period.
Current entitlements for example, bonus and share awards which will lapse on the executives departure from a previous position may be replaced with awards that have no shorter time horizons, are subject to performance conditions if replacing awards subject to performance conditions and do not have a higher theoretical fair value.
The Committee retains exibility to do so on such basis as it deems appropriate in the circumstances.
In the event that an existing employee is promoted to the Board, any contractual commitments made to the employee prior to such promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is ful lled.
Current service contracts and terms of engagement The Chairman and executive directors hold one year rolling contracts in line with current market practice and the Committee reviews the terms of these contracts regularly.
The current contracts are dated as follows: R G Dench - 8 February 2007 N S Terrington - 1 September 1990 amended 16 February 1993, 30 October 2001 and 10 March 2010 N Keen - 6 February 1996 amended 30 October 2001 and 10 March 2010 J A Heron - 1 September 1990 amended 14 January, 8 February 1993 and 10 March 2010 R J Woodman - 8 February 1996 amended 10 March 2010 In the event of early termination, the directors contracts provide for the payment of one years salary, bene ts, pension and bonus in lieu of notice at the Companys option, payable on termination.
No provision exists for additional compensation in the event of termination due to a change of control of the Company.
These arrangements will continue to be honoured as they are contractual obligations of the Company.
All new executive directors externally appointed in future will have service contracts that are terminable by the Company on a maximum of twelve months notice, subject to a payment of salary, bene ts and pension.
Provisions will be included in each new contract permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and requiring directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Of the directors seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting, Mr Dench, Mr Terrington, Mr Keen, Mr Heron and Mr Woodman each has a service contract with the Company.
Executive directors may accept an external non-executive appointment with the approval of the Board.
Any fees earned are retained by the executive.
None of the executive directors currently earns remuneration from external non-executive appointments.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 48 B Corporate governance Current terms of engagement for the non-executive directors apply for the following periods: E A Tilly - 1 April 2011 to 1 April 2014 A K Fletcher - 25 February 2012 to 25 February 2015 P J N Hartill - 11 February 2011 to 11 February 2014 F J Clutterbuck - 12 September 2012 to 12 September 2015 Non-executive director appointments are for three years unless terminated earlier by, and at the discretion of, the director or the Company upon three months notice.
Policy on termination payments The provisions of the executive directors service contracts as noted above will determine their entitlement to salary, bene ts, pension and bonus as compensation for loss of of ce.
Speci c change of control provisions or entitlements to enhanced redundancy payments would be excluded.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with the termination would be paid as necessary.
In speci c circumstances, outplacement services and relocation expenses may be provided at normal market rates for directors.
For current executive directors, any entitlement to a bonus on termination would be based on an assessment of the performance over the period.
For a new appointment, bonuses are normally only payable where the individual remains employed and is not under notice at the payment date.
However, in certain good leaver situations injury or disability, redundancy, employment transferred outside the Group, or any other reason the Committee decides a bonus may be payable at the Committees discretion, based on an assessment of the performance of the individual and the Company over the period of the bonus year worked.
The treatment of share based incentive awards will be determined by the Committee based on the relevant rules of the plan.
The default treatment for outstanding unvested PSP awards will be that they lapse on cessation of employment.
In certain circumstances the Committee may determine a good leaver status, whereby an award shall continue on its original terms, until the normal vesting date unless the Committee decides it shall vest on the date of cessation subject to time pro-rating and assessment of the performance conditions.
The Committee may disapply time pro-rating if it considers the reduction is inappropriate.
If a participant dies before the normal vesting date the Committee may allow early vesting of the award, unless it considers it appropriate to continue to the normal vesting date.
Awards are subject to time pro-rating and assessment of the performance conditions unless the Committee considers the reduction by time pro-rating to be inappropriate, whereby it can be disapplied.
The default treatment for outstanding unvested MSP awards will be that they lapse on cessation of employment.
If a participant dies before the normal vesting date the award shall vest in full on the date of cessation.
For awards granted under the deferred share bonus plan, good leaver status would result in awards vesting on the date of cessation unless the Committee determines they should continue to the normal vesting date.
On determination of a good leaver status or as the result of a death, then awards under all plans may be exercised within twelve months of the date of vesting.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 49 B Corporate governance B3.2 Policy report continued Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group Directors and senior executives participate in the annual bonus scheme, which is designed to incentivise executives to achieve speci c, predetermined goals, reward individual performance and encourage retention through deferral of a proportion of the bonus.
All members of staff whose performance has been exceptional are eligible for a discretionary bonus.
Directors and senior staff are eligible to participate in the PSP and the MSP, although no awards have been made under the MSP since January 2010 and the Remuneration Committee has no current intention of making any further grants during the current financial year or, other than in exceptional circumstances, before the expiry of the MSP in 2016.
The two plans are in place to encourage the long-term retention of key executives who are considered to have the potential to in uence shareholder value creation and awards are not offered to the wider staff.
Staff below director and head of function level are eligible to participate in the Groups pro t related pay scheme, which pays out a at sum to all eligible staff based on a percentage of the Groups pro ts.
The Groups pension arrangements provide for a pension of 1 37.5 of basic annual salary to a maximum of 2 3 for every year of eligible service for directors and certain senior executives, whereas the accrual rate for other members of staff who are members of the Paragon Pension Plan is 1 60.
The Plan was closed to new entrants in 2002 and participation in a stakeholder fide ned contribution scheme was offered to new employees from that date.
In determining pay levels for the employees as a whole, the Group annually considers externally provided benchmark levels for comparable jobs as well as individual development and performance.
The general level of increase resulting from this review informs the Committees deliberations on appropriate pay levels for the executive directors, together with external data speci c to their roles which is used to ensure that the levels of remuneration are appropriate.
The Committee does not formally consult employees on executive remuneration.
However, they have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect of the Companys activities through employee forums and surveys and their comments are considered by the Committee.
Consideration of shareholders views The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting shortly following the AGM.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
In addition, the Chairman of the Committee and the Chairman of the Company regularly engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies and report their views back to the Committee, who take them into account when formulating any material changes to the remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as the payment of pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have or will have been disclosed to shareholders in remuneration reports before the Policy takes effect.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
