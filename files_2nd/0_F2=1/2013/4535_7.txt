8 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Chief Executives strategic review An interview with Michael Sharp Michael Sharp talks about how we performed during 2013, the key challenges we are facing, how we are addressing those challenges through our strategy to build a leading international, multi-channel brand and how we are ensuring the long-term viability of our business.
Can you summarise your strategy for Debenhams?
Our strategic goal is to create sustainable value through building a leading international, multi-channel brand.
There are four pillars to this strategy: 1 focusing on UK retail, 2 delivering a compelling customer proposition, 3 increasing choice and availability through multi-channel and 4 expanding the brand internationally.
I first articulated this strategy when I became Chief Executive in the autumn of 2011 and we are focused relentlessly on its execution.
What were your highs and lows of Debenhams performance in 2013?
I believe we made some solid progress in 2013 against the backdrop of a very tough environment characterised by weak consumer sentiment, a highly competitive marketplace and unhelpful weather conditions.
We were clearly disappointed and frustrated by the impact of widespread snow during the crucial January sale period on our profitability in the first half of the year but I believe we did everything we could to mitigate its effect.
I was particularly pleased by our market share performance during the year.
We gained share in key product categories and saw good growth in areas which we had particularly targeted for share growth, such as footwear where we gained share in womens, mens and childrens shoes.
Our multi-channel business continued to grow well ahead of the market with online sales up 46.2% compared with market growth of 14.1%.
We are on track to meet our medium-term online sales target of 600 million.
