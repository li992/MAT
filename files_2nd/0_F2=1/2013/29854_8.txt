The group operates from about 500 sites in the UK, and this is by far its most important market, accounting for 75% of sales and almost all of current profits.
The groups origins lie in Ireland, where it is very clearly the largest builders merchant, with its 100 sites and estimated 30% market share making it four times the size of the next largest operator.
Grafton also has a significant presence in the Irish DIY market, where it is even more dominant, accounting for over 60% of big box DIY space.
Builders merchants operate in a structurally attractive market, with deep economic moats existing and there are no obvious threats to the business model.
