By joining Senior, Derek forfeited entitlements from his previous employer which had no performance conditions and were close to vesting on maturity.
In structuring his recruitment package, the Committee sought as much as possible to partly compensate him with awards that vest over longer time periods which are subject to performance conditions based on the longer-term performance of Senior and take into account the expected value of the awards.
The estimated value of the benefits foregone by Derek Harding at his previous employer was 775,000 based on the share price of his former employer on the date he joined Senior.
Inrecognition of the fact that Derek Harding was relinquishing awards from his previous employment which were close to vesting ormaturity, a cash payment of 100,000 was paid to Derek Harding in December 2013 and the Committee granted him the following awards: Face value Number Vesting Form of award of award of Shares conditions Deferred Share Award under Listing Rule 9.4.

The face value of the LTIP award was calculated using theclosing shareprice on 3 September 2013, being the trading day immediately prior to the date of the award, which was 278.1p per share.
The deferred share award will ordinarily lapse on cessation of employment as to unvested parts except in certain good leaver circumstances.
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company not being an internal corporate reorganisation the award will vest early at such time to such extent as considered appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.
No amendments to the advantage of Derek Harding will be made to the material terms of the award without shareholder approval other than any minor alteration to: i benefit the administration of the award: ii take account of a change in legislation: or iii obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange or regulatory treatment for him or the Company.

He has decided to also waive 53,000 of his 2014 salary, so taking a salary of 410,000.
2 Derek Hardings 2013 annual salary of 300,000 was used for the purposes of calculating the percentage change in his salary, although he joined the Company on 2September 2013.
3 A bench marking exercise found the fees paid for the Chairs of Audit and Remuneration and for the role of the Senior Independent Director were well below the rates paid forsuch roles in similar organisations and consequently increases in excess of inflation were considered appropriate.
After these increases, the fees remain below median.
