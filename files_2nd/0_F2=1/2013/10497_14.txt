Purchase of own shares At the annual general meeting of Mondi plc held in May 2013 shareholder approval was received to undertake an odd-lot offer.
In connection with this, shareholders passed a resolution authorising Mondi plc to repurchase ordinary shares in Mondi plc from shareholders holding less than 100 ordinary shares in Mondi plc.
As a result, on 17 July 2013 Mondi plc repurchased 96,591 Mondi plc ordinary shares of E0.20 each on the UK share register at a price of 965.43 pence per share and 322,727 Mondi plc ordinary shares of E0.20 each on the South African branch register at a price of 13903.10 rand cents per share.

Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report on pages 10 to 47.
The most significant risks and the Groups related management and mitigating actions are set out in the Corporate governance report on pages 66 to 68.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements.
Mondis geographical spread, product diversity and large customer base mitigate potential risks of customer or supplier liquidity issues.
Ongoing initiatives by management in implementing profit improvement initiatives which include ongoing investment in its operations, plant optimisation, cost-cutting, and restructuring and rationalisation activities have consolidated the Groups leading cost position in its chosen markets.
Working capital levels and capital expenditure programmes are strictly monitored and controlled.
The Group meets its funding requirements from a variety of sources as more fully described in note 19 of the financial statements.
The availability of some of these facilities is dependent on the Group meeting certain financial covenants all of which have been complied with.
Mondi had E792 million of undrawn committed debt facilities as at 31 December 2013 which should provide sufficient liquidity in the medium term.
The Groups debt facilities have maturity dates of between 1 and 12 years, with an average maturity of 3.7 years.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, including an assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, indicate that the Group should be able to operate well within the level of its current facilities and related covenants.
The directors have reviewed the overall Group strategy, the budget for 2014 and subsequent years, considered the assumptions contained in the budget and reviewed the critical risks which may impact the Groups performance.
After making such enquiries, the directors are satisfied that the Group remains solvent and has adequate liquidity in order to meet its obligations and continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the integrated report and financial statements.

indd 105 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Directors responsibility statement The directors are responsible for preparing the integrated report, remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
South African and UK company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under the Companies Act of South Africa 2008, the directors are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for each financial year giving a true and fair view of the Mondi Limited parent companys and the Groups state of affairs at the end of the year and profit and loss for the year.
Under the UK Companies Act 2006, the directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Mondi plc parent company financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Furthermore, under UK company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit and loss of the company for that period.
In preparing the Groups financial statements and the Mondi Limited parent company financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires that the directors: properly select and consistently apply accounting policies: present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: provide additional disclosure when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance: and make an assessment of the Groups and companys ability to continue as a going concern.
In preparing the Mondi plc parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101, Reduced Disclosure Framework, has been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Groups and parent companies transactions: disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent companies: and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and companies and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

indd 106 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Report on the financial statements These financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the Group chief financial officer, Andrew King CA SA, and have been audited in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008 and the UK Companies Act 2006.
The Boards confirm that to the best of their knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of Mondi Limited, Mondi plc and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of Mondi Limited, Mondi plc and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face: and the integrated report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups performance, business model and strategy.
The Groups combined and consolidated financial statements, and related notes 1 to 38, were approved by the Boards and authorised for issue on 27 February 2014 and were signed on its behalf by: David Hathorn Andrew King Director Director Mondi Group 107 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 107 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditors report to the shareholders of Mondi Limited Report on the financial statements We have audited the Group financial statements of Mondi Limited set out on pages 114 to 188, which comprise the combined and consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, the combined and consolidated income statement, the combined and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows and the combined and consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended, and the notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Directors responsibility for the financial statements The Groups directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the combined and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the Groups preparation and presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the Group financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Mondi Group as at 31 December 2013, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.
Other reports required by the Companies Act As part of our audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, we have read the Directors report, the DLC audit committees report and the Company secretarys certificate for the purpose of identifying whether there are material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited financial statements.
These reports are the responsibility of the respective preparers.
Based on reading these reports we have not identified material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited financial statements.
However, we have not audited these reports and accordingly do not express an opinion on these reports.

The financial statements comprise the combined and consolidated income statement, the combined and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the combined and consolidated and Mondi plc parent company statements of financial position, the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows, the combined and consolidated and Mondi plc parent company statements of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 38 of the combined and consolidated financial statements and notes 1 to 8 of the Mondi plc parent company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors statement on page 103 that the Group is a going concern.
We confirm that: we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate: and we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.

In performing our audit procedures, we used internal assets requires significant management judgement, as valuation specialists to assess the discount rate applied.

Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
110 Integrated report and financial statements 2013 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 110 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be E28 million, which is below 5% of profit before tax and special items, and below 2% of equity.
Special items are defined by the Group as those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance by the Group with further details provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
Since these items are non-recurring in nature, it has been concluded that it is appropriate to exclude these items in determining materiality.
We agreed with the DLC audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences identified in excess of E560,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also reported to the committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit Mondi Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi plc and Mondi Limited, which operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi plc and its subsidiaries, and Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, the financial statements of Mondi Group is prepared and reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.
Our Group audit scope focused primarily on the audit work at 15 locations from across Mondi Group, which were subject to a full audit completed using materiality which was set at a level lower than Group materiality.
These 15 locations represent the principal business units and account for 63% of the Groups revenue.
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
A further 30 locations were subject to an audit of specified account balances where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Groups operations at those locations.
These 30 locations represent a further 21% of the Groups revenue.
From the above audit scope, in aggregate the locations subject to audit procedures represents 84% of the Groups revenue.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits the 8 operating locations that have been assessed as the most financially significant to the Group at least once every three years, or more frequently where other indicators are identified.
In the current year, a senior member of the Group audit team therefore visited certain of the Groups operations in Austria, Germany, Russia and South Africa.
Furthermore, for each of the businesses included within the programme of planned visits, the Group audit team also discusses audit findings with the relevant component audit team throughout the audit engagement and reviews relevant audit working papers.
For the remaining 7 locations where full audits were completed, we discuss audit findings with the relevant component audit team, reviews audit working papers in relation to key issues and discuss key matters with divisional management where considered necessary in forming our Group audit opinion.
In relation to the 30 locations which were subject to an audit of specified account balances, we discuss the results of these businesses and accounting matters arising through our involvement in divisional meetings with management.

indd 119 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 1a Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Groups combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
There are no differences for the Group in applying IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group also complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Group has also complied with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Reporting Standards Council of South Africa.
The combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the directors report, under the heading Going concern.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the fair valuing of financial instruments and forestry assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation Dual listed structure The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries, operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.
Subsidiaries The combined and consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, and of their respective subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern operating and financial policy in order to obtain economic benefits.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years presented are included in the combined and consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquiring control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Non-controlling interests are measured, at initial recognition, as the non-controlling proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.
After initial recognition, non-controlling interests are measured as the aggregate of the value at initial recognition and their subsequent proportionate share of profits and losses.
Changes in the Groups interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Any resulting difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests is adjusted for and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the shareholders.
Associates Associates are investments over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Typically, the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity of its associates.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
The total carrying values of investments in associates represent the cost of each investment including the carrying value of goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings, any other movements in reserves and any long-term debt interests which, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in that entity.
The carrying values of associates are reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment has occurred, it is written off in the year in which those circumstances arose.
The Groups share of an associates losses in excess of its interest in that associate is not recognised unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses.
120 Integrated report and financial statements 2013 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 120 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Fair value measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, in the principal or most advantageous market, at the measurement date under current market conditions i. e. an exit price regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
The Group measures the fair value of an asset or a liability using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interests.
The Group measures the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position i. e. an asset for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position i. e. a liability for a particular risk exposure.
Revenue recognition Sale of goods Revenue is derived principally from the sale of goods and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
This is when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.
Sale of green energy and CO e credits 2 Revenues generated from the sale of green energy and CO e credits issued under international schemes are recorded as income 2 within other net operating expenses in the combined and consolidated income statement when ownership rights pass to the buyer.
Investment income Interest income, which is derived from cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, and loans and receivables, is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effective interest rate.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment has been established.
Business combinations Identifiable net assets At the date of acquisition the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or an associate are recorded at their fair values on acquisition date.
Assets and liabilities which cannot be measured reliably are recorded at provisional fair values, which are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Cost of a business combination The cost of a business combination includes the fair value of assets provided, liabilities incurred or assumed, and any equity instruments issued by a Group entity, in exchange for control of an acquiree.
The directly attributable costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is attributed to goodwill.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Boards for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial year, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.

indd 121 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 1a Accounting policies continued Non-current non-financial assets excluding goodwill, deferred tax and net retirement benefits asset Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise land and buildings, plant and equipment and assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing the assets to the location and condition for their intended use and includes borrowing costs incurred to the extent that the asset is a qualifying asset.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values at varying rates, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives range from three years to 20 years for items of plant and equipment and to a maximum of 50 years for buildings.
Other intangibles and research and development expenditure Other intangibles are measured initially at purchase consideration and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives vary between three years and 10 years and are reviewed at least annually.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Development costs are capitalised when the completion of the asset is both commercially and technically feasible and are amortised on a systematic basis over the economic life of the related development.
Development costs are recognised as an expense if they do not qualify for capitalisation.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-inuse.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset, or cash-generating unit, is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment recognised as an expense.
Where the underlying circumstances change such that a previously recognised impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.
Such a reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset, or cash-generating unit, in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Agriculture owned forestry assets Owned forestry assets are measured at fair value, calculated by applying the expected selling price, less costs to harvest and deliver, to the estimated volume of timber on hand at each reporting date.
The estimated volume of timber on hand is determined based on the maturity profile of the area under afforestation, the species, the geographic location and other environmental considerations and excludes future growth.
The product of these is then adjusted to present value by applying a market related pre tax discount rate.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within other net operating expenses.
At point of felling, the carrying value of forestry assets is transferred to inventory.
Directly attributable costs incurred during the year of biological growth and investments in standing timber are capitalised and presented within cash flows from investing activities.
122 Integrated report and financial statements 2013 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 122 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Assets held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal from the date on which these conditions are met.
Any resulting impairment is reported through the combined and consolidated income statement as a special item.
On classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.
Comparative amounts are not adjusted.
Current non-financial assets Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the first-in-first-out FIFO or weighted average cost basis, as appropriate.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is defined as the selling price less any estimated costs of disposal.
Retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans for the majority of its employees as well as post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the amount charged to the combined and consolidated income statement is the contributions paid or payable during the reporting period.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans For defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, actuarial valuations are performed at each financial year end using the projected unit credit method.
The average discount rate for the plans liabilities is based on AA rated corporate bonds or similar government bonds of a suitable duration and currency.
Plans assets are measured using market values at the end of the reporting period.
The net retirement benefits liability recognised in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit liability as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any net retirement benefits asset resulting from this calculation is limited to an asset ceiling which is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the relevant Group plans.
Any increase in the present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to operating profit as service costs.
Past service costs resulting from plan amendments or curtailments and gains or losses on settlements are charged to operating profit.
A net interest expense or net interest income is calculated by applying the discount rate, on a per plan basis, to the net defined benefit liability or asset and recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within net finance costs.
Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets after recognising the net finance charge are recognised in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax, in the reporting period in which they occur.
Remeasurements recorded in other comprehensive income are not recycled, but those amounts recognised in other comprehensive income may be transferred within equity.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax charge and the movement in deferred tax.
Current tax The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

indd 123 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 1a Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition, other than in a business combination, of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
The carrying amount is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered within a reasonable period of time.
Similarly, it is increased to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future for all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered within a reasonable period of time.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the combined and consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at inception of the lease at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments derived by discounting lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest element of the rental is recognised as a finance charge in the combined and consolidated income statement, unless it is directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case it is capitalised in accordance with the Groups policy on borrowing costs.
These assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the expected useful economic lives of the assets.
Operating leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the combined and consolidated income statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern of use.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, which it will be required to settle.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is material.
Restoration and environmental costs An obligation to incur restoration and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the ongoing production of a plant or landfill site.
Costs for restoration of site damage are provided for at their present values and charged against profit and loss as the obligation arises.

indd 124 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Government grants Government grants are recognised when the right to receive such grants is established and are treated as deferred income.
They are released to the combined and consolidated income statement on a systematic basis, either over the expected useful lives of the assets for which they are provided, or over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.
Foreign currency transactions and translation Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded in their functional currencies at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classified as either operating or financing depending on the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.
Translation of overseas operations The Groups results are presented in euro, the currency in which most of its business is conducted.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year where these approximate the rates on the dates of the underlying transactions.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are reclassified to profit and loss only on disposal or partial disposal of the overseas operation.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised concurrently as an expense and an adjustment to equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards granted, as adjusted for market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions where applicable.
Vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected to vest as a result of changes in non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the combined and consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups combined and consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial asset investments Investments, other than investments in subsidiaries and associates, are either classified as available-for-sale or loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at fair value.
They are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to fair value.
Any unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in equity until an investment is disposed of or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term, highly liquid investments of a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows and in the presentation of net debt are reflected net of overdrafts.

indd 125 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 1a Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less allowance for any impairment as appropriate.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the construction period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently held at fair value in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position within derivative financial instruments, and are classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classified within operating profit or net finance costs, depending on the type of risk to which the derivative relates.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, amounts deferred in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit and loss on a proportionate basis.
Fair value hedges For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Gains or losses from remeasuring the associated derivative are also recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.

indd 126 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Ineffective, expired, sold, terminated or exercised hedging instruments Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Equity instruments, share issue costs, treasury shares and dividend payments Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction, net of applicable tax, from the proceeds.
An incremental share issue cost is one which would not have arisen if shares had not been issued.
Treasury shares The purchase by any Group entity of either Mondi Limiteds or Mondi plcs equity instruments results in the recognition of treasury shares.
The consideration paid is deducted from equity.
Where treasury shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to the equity holders of either Mondi Limited or Mondi plc, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects.
Dividend payments Dividend distributions to Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved.
Final dividends are accrued when approved by both Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders at their respective annual general meetings and interim dividends are recognised when approved by the Boards.
Special items Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group and its businesses.
Such items must exceed E5 million or are material in nature in relation to the financial years results.
Earnings per share EPS Basic EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of the sum of ordinary Mondi Limited and Mondi plc shares in issue during the year, net of treasury shares.
Diluted EPS For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of the sum of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shares in issue, net of treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share awards granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease EPS.
The effect of anti-dilutive potential shares is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.
Underlying and headline EPS Underlying EPS excludes the impact of special items and is a non-IFRS measure.
It is included to provide an additional basis on which to measure the Groups earnings performance.
The presentation of headline EPS is mandated under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and is calculated in accordance with Circular 2 2013, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Segmental reporting The Groups operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the DLC executive committee, the chief operating decision-making body.

indd 127 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 1a Accounting policies continued New accounting policies, early adoption and future requirements Standards and Interpretations early adopted by the Group There were no Standards or Interpretations early adopted by the Group in the current year.
An amendment to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets which clarifies certain disclosure requirements was adopted with effect from 1 January 2013.
Standards, amendments to published Standards and Interpretation effective during 2013 The Group has adopted the following Standards and amendments to published Standards during the current year, and their impact on the Groups results are detailed in note 1b: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits The following Standards, amendments to published Standards and Interpretation which the Group has adopted during the current year, had no significant impact on the Groups results except for the addition of certain disclosures: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine Standards, amendments to published Standards and Interpretation that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following amendments to published Standards and Interpretation are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups results, and will become effective for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 January 2014: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 2 Share-based Payments IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 39 Financial Instruments IAS 40 Investment Property IFRIC 21 Levies The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the following Standard on the Groups results, which currently has no effective date: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 128 Integrated report and financial statements 2013 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 128 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Accounting estimates and critical judgements The preparation of the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect certain items reported in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and the combined and consolidated income statement.
The disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities is also affected by the use of estimation techniques.
Although the estimates used are based on managements best information about current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Such estimates relate to managements assumptions about expected future cash flows, market exposures, useful lives and discount rates, amongst others.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Capitalisation of tangible assets estimated residual values and useful economic lives refer to accounting policies.
Estimated impairment of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets refer to notes 11 and 12.
Fair value of owned forestry assets refer to note 13.
Retirement benefits refer to note 23.
1b Restatement of comparative information IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 broadened the concept of control and eliminated the option of proportionate consolidation for joint ventures, except in certain circumstances.
The impact of these Standards has been that Mondi Shanduka Newsprint Proprietary Limited has been consolidated whilst Aylesford Newsprint Limited has been accounted for using the equity method up to the date of sale in 2012.
Comparative information has been restated.
IAS 19 revised impacted the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures.
As the Group has always recognised actuarial gains and losses immediately, the Groups total obligation was unchanged.
This Standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2012 as it was impractical to complete revised actuarial valuations prior to that date.
Following the replacement of expected returns on plan assets with a net finance cost in the combined and consolidated income statement, the profit for the period was reduced and accordingly other comprehensive income increased in 2012.
Comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been restated.
The following tables summarise the impacts resulting from the changes in accounting policies above on the Groups income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position and statement of cash flows.

The Group operates under two primary geographic regions reflecting its South African activities and assets, and its international, principally European, activities and assets.
The broad European region is further split by product segments reflecting the management structure of the Group.
Mondi Shanduka Newsprint was incorporated into the South Africa Division during 2012 due to similarities in geographical location, production processes and the integrated nature of the production facilities and is now consolidated as a subsidiary.
The effects of this change on the comparative periods are set out in note 1b.
The Groups segmental information for the comparative periods has been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy.
Product revenues The material product types from which the Groups externally reportable segments derive both their internal and external revenues are presented as follows: 1 Operating segments Revenues Europe & International Packaging Paper Packaging paper Fibre Packaging Fibre packaging Consumer Packaging Consumer packaging Uncoated Fine Paper Uncoated fine paper Pulp Newsprint South Africa Division Packaging paper Pulp Uncoated fine paper Newsprint external only Note: 1 Revenues are derived from both internal and external sales.
The Group operates a  structure in order to benefit from economies of scale and to more effectively manage the risk of adverse price movements in key input costs.
Internal revenues are therefore generated across the supply chain.

indd 132 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Measurement of operating segment revenues, profit and loss, assets and non-current non-financial assets Management has regard to certain operating segment measures in making resource allocation decisions and monitoring segment performance.
The operating segment measures required to be disclosed adhere to the recognition and measurement criteria presented in the Groups accounting policies.
In addition, the Group has presented certain non-IFRS measures by segment to supplement the users understanding.
All intra-group transactions are conducted on an arms length basis.
The Groups measure of net segment assets includes the allocation of net retirement benefits assets and liabilities.
The measure of segment results exclude, however, the financing effects of the Groups defined benefit retirement plans.
In addition, the Groups measure of net segment assets does not include an allocation for derivative assets and liabilities, non-operating receivables and payables and assets held for sale and associated liabilities.
The measure of segment results includes the effects of certain movements in these unallocated balances.
The Groups geographic analysis is presented on the following level: continental: or sub-continental: or by individual country if greater than 10% of the Group total.
There has been no change in the basis of measurement of segment profit and loss in the financial year.
The DLC executive committee uses EBITDA as a measure of cash flow, coupled with the depreciation and amortisation charge, for making decisions about, amongst others, allocation of funds for capital investment.

indd 146 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to each cash-generating unit CGU which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a three year period that are based on the latest forecasts for revenue and cost as approved by the Boards.
Projected revenues and costs are determined taking into consideration relevant industry forecasts for individual product lines: management projections: and historical performance and announced industry capacity changes.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management forecasts.
Growth rates in the countries in which the Group operates are determined with reference to published growth domestic product information.
Zero percent growth rates are assumed in perpetuity for most of the businesses given the commodity nature of the majority of the products i. e. nominal growth is assumed to be offset by real price declines.
Following the acquisition of Nordenia in 2012, growth of 2% 2012: 3% was assumed for Consumer Packaging given the nature of the business and its expected growth rates.
Post tax cash flow projections are discounted using a post tax discount rate, adjusted by a country risk premium which considers the residual economic, legal and political risks of a jurisdiction not reflected in the underlying cash flows specific to each CGU.
Country risk premiums range from 0.5% to 3% 2012: 0% to 3%, with some exceptions where it can be up to 4%.
Each country risk premium is estimated based on a number of external sources as well as managements judgement.
The discount rate is determined as the Groups weighted average cost of capital using published market data and published borrowing rates.
Summary of key assumptions % 2013 2012 Discount rate 7.38 7.37 Country risk premiums 0.5-4.0 0-3 Perpetuity growth rates Consumer Packaging 2 3 All other divisions Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time.
They are affected by a number of factors, including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure.
Sensitivity analyses performed included: 1% increase in discount rate: 0% growth rate assumed in Consumer Packaging: and 5% decrease in cash flows.
None of these downside sensitivities indicated the need for an impairment.

Plantations are considered harvestable after a specific age depending on the species planted and regional considerations.
The fair value of forestry assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy and this category is consistent with prior years.
The fair value of forestry assets is calculated on the basis of future expected net cash flows arising on the Groups owned forestry assets, discounted using a discount rate relevant in the local country, based on a pre tax real yield on long-term bonds over the last five years.
All fair value gains originate from South Africa.

indd 150 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Managements judgement is exercised in determining the future net cash flows and the discount rate.
Future net cash flows are dependent upon inputs including expected selling prices: costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading THEL : and the factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber which in itself is dependent on a variety of environmental factors.
Net selling price is selling price after deduction of THEL costs.

a Trade receivables: credit risk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 35. Credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and invoicing conventions established by, participants operating in the various markets in which the Group operates.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are considered overdue in the relevant market.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the combined and consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
The total gross carrying value of trade receivables that were subject to impairment during the year is E44 million 2012: E38 million.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling E42 million 2012: E50 million which are past due but not impaired as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.

The fair values of the E500 million 2017 Eurobond, E500 million 2020 Eurobond and E280 million Eurobond are estimated with reference to the last price quoted in the secondary market.
All other financial liabilities are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

Appropriate valuation methodologies are employed to measure the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The notional amounts presented represent the aggregate face value of all derivatives outstanding at the reporting date.
They do not indicate the contractual future cash flows of the derivative instruments held or their current fair value and therefore do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or market risks.
Note 35 provides an overview of the Groups management of financial risks through the selective use of derivative financial instruments and also includes a presentation of the undiscounted future contractual cash flows of the derivative contracts outstanding at the reporting date.
Hedging Cash flow hedges The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.
The fair value gains losses are reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit and loss in the period when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
For non-current non-financial assets, these gains losses are included in the carrying value of the asset and depreciated over the same useful life as the cost of the asset.
The fair value losses reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve during 2012 and matched against the realisation of hedged risks in the combined and consolidated income statement were as follows: E million 2013 2012 Net finance costs 2 Total reclassification adjustments 2 There was no ineffectiveness recognised in profit and loss arising on cash flow hedges for both the years presented.
Held-for-trading derivatives E million 2013 2012 Net fair value gains on held-for-trading derivatives 7 Held-for-trading derivatives are used primarily to hedge foreign exchange balance sheet exposures.
Held-for-trading derivative gains losses have corresponding losses gains which arise on the revaluation of the foreign exchange balance sheet exposures being hedged.
The Group elected not to apply hedge accounting to the held-for-trading derivatives.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on gross temporary differences of E786 million 2012: E719 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A change to UK tax legislation largely exempts, from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
As a result, the gross temporary differences at 31 December 2013 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

indd 161 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 23 Retirement benefits The Group operates post-retirement defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for the majority of its employees.
It also operates two post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans of E11 million 2012: E11 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined contribution plans during 2014 are E6 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans Only a few of the defined benefit plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world.
The majority of the defined benefit plans are unfunded pension and severance plans, principally in Europe.
The defined benefit pension plan in South Africa entered the liquidation process in August 2012 and Mondi Limited expects to receive a reimbursement of the pension surplus of E6 million once the fund is wound up, subject to any potential claims.
No further claims have been lodged with the fund since it entered the liquidation process.
The expected reimbursement is included in trade and other receivables.
The post-retirement medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain of their dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The South African plan is unfunded whilst the Austrian plan is funded.
The South African plan has been closed to new participants since 1 January 1999.
The boards of trustees of the plans are required to act in the best interest of the plans and of all relevant stakeholders of the plans, i. e. active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers.
The boards of trustees are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the plans.
Defined benefit plans typically expose the Group to the following actuarial risks: Investment risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality bond yields.
If the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit that needs to be funded guaranteed by the employer.
Currently the plan assets have a relatively balanced investment in equity and bonds.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the boards of trustees consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equities.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase plan liabilities, however this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans debt instruments.
Longevity risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Salary risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every year using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2013.

However, in South Africa the discount rate assumption has been based on the zero coupon government bond yield curve.
Mortality assumptions The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2013 2012 Europe & Europe & years South Africa International South Africa International Retiring today: Males 15.94 13.86 22.70 15.91 12.88 22.50 Females 19.89 17.08 26.77 19.85 16.68 26.17 Retiring in 20 years: Males 20.34 13.86 22.70 20.24 12.88 22.69 Females 24.64 14.00 25.99 24.55 16.68 25.99 The mortality assumptions have been based on published mortality tables in the relevant jurisdictions.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 76% 2012: 72% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the plans trustees and in accordance with local actuarial advice and statutory provisions.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members.
Consequently, it is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans during 2014 are E17 million 2013: E15 million.

Due to legal and market restrictions asset-liability matching is not possible.
UK The trustees invest in diverse portfolios of pooled funds.
The long-term objective is to ensure that each plan can continue to meet the benefit payments without exposing either the plan or the Company to an undue level of risk.

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
A 1% change in the assumptions would have the following effects on the net retirement benefits plans: E million 1% increase 1% decrease Discount rate Effect on aggregate of the current service cost and interest cost 3 1 Effect on net retirement benefit asset liability 52 56 Rate of inflation Effect on aggregate of the current service cost and interest cost 3 1 Effect on net retirement benefit asset liability 52 56 Medical cost trend rate Effect on aggregate of the current service cost and interest cost 1 1 Effect on net retirement benefit asset liability 11 10 The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual changes in the net retirement benefits asset liability as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be interrelated.

indd 177 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 34 Capital management continued The Group reviews its capital employed on a regular basis and makes use of several indicative ratios which are appropriate to the nature of the Groups operations and are consistent with conventional industry measures.
The principal ratios used in this review process are: gearing, defined as net debt divided by total equity plus net debt: and return on capital employed, defined as trailing 12 month underlying operating profit, plus share of associates net profit loss, divided by trailing 12 month average capital employed.
Restated % 2013 2012 Gearing 36.3 39.5 Return on capital employed 15.3 13.6 The Group operates a DLC structure which has been agreed with the South African Ministry of Finance and is subject to certain exchange control conditions.
The exchange control conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to optimally manage its capital structure.
However, they do require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, be constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism, which serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
The Group has continually met the exchange control provisions in the past and management is committed to ensuring that the Group continues to meet these provisions in future.
The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Boards and are overseen by the DLC executive committee.
In turn, the DLC executive committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group treasury continually reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment: identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties where appropriate.
The Group does not take speculative positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
35 Financial risk management Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Both risks are actively monitored on a regular basis and managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps as appropriate.
Although the Groups cash flows are exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent commercial rather than financial risk inherent to the Group.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates globally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business.
Multiple currency exposures arise from commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and translational exposure on net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign exchange contracts The Groups treasury policy requires its subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency transactional exposures against their functional currencies by entering into foreign exchange contracts.
For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts for, foreign exchange contracts with Group treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more commercially appropriate.
Only material balance sheet exposures and highly probable forecast capital expenditure transactions are hedged.
Foreign exchange contracts entered into to mitigate possible movements on recognised monetary items are marked to market at each reporting date.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at each reporting date to incorporate the underlying foreign exchange movements and any such movements naturally offset fair value movements on related forward foreign exchange contracts.

The sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the Groups reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within the functional currency environments that the Group operates in.
In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Groups equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historic currency volatility, together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.

indd 179 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 35 Financial risk management continued Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates The Group believes that for each functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure it is reasonable to assume a 5% appreciation depreciation of the functional currency.
If all other variables are held constant, the table below presents the impacts on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement if these currency movements had occurred.
2013 2012 Income expense Income expense E million 5% -5% 5% -5% Functional currency zones Russian rouble 1 1 Czech koruna 1 1 1 1 Turkish lira 1 1 Other 2 2 1 1 The corresponding fair value impact on the Groups equity, resulting from the application of these reasonably possible changes to the valuation of the Groups foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, would have been E6 million 2012: E4 million.
It has been assumed that changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of non-monetary assets and liabilities are fully recorded in equity and that all other variables are held constant.
Interest rate risk The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earn interest at a variable rate and has variable and fixed rate debt in issue.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk.
Although the Group has fixed rate debt in issue, the Groups accounting policy stipulates that all borrowings be held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is not sensitive to changes in credit conditions in the relevant debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
Management of cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
Management of variable rate debt The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the most significant is the syndicated facility RCF see note 19.
When deemed necessary, Group treasury uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain exposures to movements in the relevant interbank lending rates, primarily the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate JIBAR.
Interest rate swaps are usually designated as cash flow hedges and are measured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined by reference to the discounted contractual future cash flows, using the relevant currencyspecific yield curves, and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents act as a natural hedge to movements in the relevant interbank lending rates on its variable rate debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between the Groups corporate saving and lending rates.

indd 180 2014 03 10 3:06 PM Net variable rate debt sensitivity analysis The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash outflows swapped from variable-to-fixed via interest rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to net variable rate exposure, denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.

Mondi Group 181 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 181 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 35 Financial risk management continued In addition to the above, the Group swaps euro debt into out of other currencies through the foreign exchange market using foreign exchange contracts which has the effect of exposing the Group to interest rates of these currencies.
The currencies swapped into out of and the amounts as at 31 December were as follows: E million 2013 2012 Long-dated contracts with tenures of more than 12 months Russian rouble 27 59 Short-dated contracts with tenures of less than 12 months Russian rouble 179 127 Czech koruna 81 51 US dollar 80 62 Pounds sterling 62 59 Swedish krona 34 13 Polish zloty 94 128 Other 57 29 Total swapped 614 410 Credit risk The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding rates for specific debt agreements entered into by other Group entities.
None of these financial guarantees contractually obligates the Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned.
As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have no bearing on the credit risk profile of the Group as a whole.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group believes that there is no significant geographical or customer concentration of credit risk.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
Of the total gross trade receivables balance of E823 million 2012: E885 million included in trade and other receivables reported in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position see note 17, credit insurance covering E663 million 2012: E621 million of the total balance has been taken out by the Groups trading entities to insure against the related credit default risk.
The insured cover is presented gross of contractually agreed excess amounts.
In addition, the Group is in possession of bank guarantees and letters of credit securing trade and other receivables to the value of E17 million 2012: E18 million.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and retrospectively assessed assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
182 Integrated report and financial statements 2013 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 182 2014 03 10 3:06 PM The following table shows the amounts available to draw down on the Groups committed loan facilities: E million 2013 2012 Expiry date In one year or less 42 27 In more than one year 750 735 Total credit available 792 762 Forecast liquidity represents the Groups expected cash inflows, principally generated from sales made to customers, less the Groups expected cash outflows, principally related to the payment of employees, supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings, including finance lease obligations, plus the payment of any interest accruing thereon.
The matching of these cash inflows and outflows rests on the expected ageing profiles of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are represented primarily by the Groups trade receivables and trade payables respectively.
The matching of the cash flows that result from trade receivables and trade payables typically takes place over a period of three to four months from recognition in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity of the Group.
Financing cash outflows may be longer-term in nature.
The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these commitments, but is significantly invested in long-term non-financial assets which generate the sustainable future cash inflows, net of future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Groups borrowings.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial assets held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The Groups financial investments, which are not held-for-trading and therefore do not comprise part of the Groups liquidity planning arrangements, make up the remainder of the non-derivative financial assets held.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
Non-interest bearing financial liabilities which are due to be settled in less than 12 months from maturity equal their carrying values, since the impact of the time value of money is immaterial over such a short duration.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments that are measured in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value or where the fair value of financial instruments have been disclosed in notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements require disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : and level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives are determined using standard valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.
184 Integrated report and financial statements 2013 7230 13 Mondi IR AFS BB43.
indd 184 2014 03 10 3:06 PM The significant inputs required to fair value all of the Groups financial instruments are either quoted prices or are observable.
The Group only holds level 1 and 2 financial instruments and therefore does not hold any financial instruments categorised as level 3 financial instruments.
There have also been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.
Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include: the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates: the Groups commodity price derivatives are fair valued by independent third parties, who in turn calculate the fair values as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable market data: and other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.
The only assets or liabilities measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy represent forestry assets.
Refer to note 13 for more details on fair value measurement.
Except as detailed in the following table, the directors consider that the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the combined and consolidated financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.

Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied by Mondi Limited are the same as those presented in note 1 to the combined and consolidated Group financial statements, to the extent that the Groups transactions and balances are applicable to a set of the company financial statements.
Principally, the accounting policies which are not directly relevant to Mondi Limited parent company financial statements are those relating to consolidation accounting and the recognition and subsequent measurement of goodwill.
IFRS 10 broadened the concept of control.
The impact of this Standard was that Mondi Shanduka Newsprint Proprietary Limited has become a subsidiary, whilst it was previously recorded as an investment in a joint venture.

indd 195 2014 03 10 3:06 PM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Mondi plc parent company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Financial Reporting Standard 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2013 the Company has undergone transition from reporting under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The adjustments did not have a material effect on the financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash-flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the group accounts of Mondi plc, which are publicly available.
The results, assets and liabilities of Mondi plc are included in the combined and consolidated Group financial statements, which are publicly available.
Mondi plc has made use of the exemption from preparing a profit and loss account, as conferred by Section 408 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Directors report additional disclosures under the heading Going concern.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are described below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied by Mondi plc are the same as those presented in note 1 to the combined and consolidated Group financial statements, to the extent that the Groups transactions and balances are applicable to a set of the company financial statements.
Principally, the accounting policies which are not directly relevant to Mondi plc parent company financial statements are those relating to consolidation accounting and the recognition and subsequent measurement of goodwill.
The accounting policies which are either different, or additional, to those applied by the Group are stated as follows: Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less provision for any diminution in value.
Retirement benefits The cost of defined contribution pension plans is charged as an expense as the costs become payable.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset or liability.
Mondi plc does not participate in the Groups defined benefit retirement plans.
Accounting estimates and critical judgements The accounting estimates and critical judgements applied by the key management of Mondi plc are discussed in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements see note 1.

3 Share-based payments The share schemes and the underlying assumptions used to estimate the associated fair value charge are set out in note 25 of the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements.
4 Deferred tax A deferred tax asset of E6 million 2012: E31 million: 2011: E29 million has not been recognised in relation to temporary differences regarding the share-based payment arrangements.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in relation to tax losses brought forward of E28 million 2012: E27 million: 2011: E24 million.
The deferred tax assets have not been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which they could be utilised.
5 Fixed asset investments E million 2013 2012 2011 Unlisted Shares at cost 2,938 2,938 2,938 Carrying value as at 31 December 2,938 2,938 2,938 The investment above is an investment in Mondi Investments Limited incorporated in the United Kingdom, a wholly-owned subsidiary which acts as an investment holding company.
6 Share capital Full disclosure of the share capital of Mondi plc is set out in note 24 of the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements.
7 Contingent liabilities Mondi plc has issued financial guarantees in respect of the UK pension schemes of its subsidiaries, obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and the borrowings of other Group undertakings.
The likelihood of these financial guarantees being called is considered to be remote and therefore the estimated financial effect of issuance is Enil 2012: Enil.
The fair value of these issued financial guarantees is deemed to be immaterial.

The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting.
Variation of rights Subject to the Companies Act, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.
At every such separate general meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares.
The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Where, under an employee share plan operated by Mondi plc, participants are the beneficial owners of the shares but not the registered owner, the voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant.

A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of Mondi plc, or of other shareholders of shares in Mondi plc, for a transfer of shares to take place.
Some of the Mondi plc employee share plans include restrictions on transfer of shares while the shares are subject to such plan.

These shares can only be transferred to another UK trust company, in limited circumstances.
The PLC Special Voting Share is a specially created share so that shareholders of both Mondi plc and Mondi Limited effectively vote together as a single decision-making body on matters affecting shareholders of both companies in similar ways, as set out in the Articles.
Prior to a change of control, approval of termination of the sharing agreement which regulates the DLC, liquidation or insolvency of Mondi plc, the PLC Special Converting Shares have no voting rights except in relation to a resolution proposing the i variation of the rights attaching to the shares or ii winding up, and they have no rights to dividends.

Mondi plc and Mondi Limited have established dividend access trust arrangements as part of the DLC.
Mondi plc has issued two dividend access shares, the UK DAS Share and UK DAN Share, which enable Mondi plc to pay dividends to the shareholders of Mondi Limited.
This facility may be used by the board to address imbalances in the distributable reserves of Mondi plc and Mondi Limited and or to address the effects of South African exchange controls and or if they otherwise consider it necessary or desirable.
Directors Appointment and replacement of directors Directors shall be no less than four and no more than 20 in number.
A director is not required to hold any shares of Mondi plc by way of qualification.

Any further directors to retire shall be those of the other directors subject to retirement by rotation who have been longest in office since their last election or re-election or, if later, deemed election or re-election and so that as between persons who became or were last re-elected directors on the same day, those to retire shall, unless they otherwise agree among themselves, be determined by lot.
In casting the lot, the provision that a director must also be a director of Mondi Limited and the corresponding provision of the Mondi Limited memorandum of incorporation shall be observed.
A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.
