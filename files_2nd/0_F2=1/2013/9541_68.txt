In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any other amounts reasonably due to the executive, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the executive in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement as provided for below and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
If the Executive Director has relocated to perform their duties, the Committee has discretion to meet the reasonable costs associated with returning that individual and where relevant their family back to their country of origin and winding up their affairs in the country in which they worked for Lonmin, including meeting the incidental costs incurred in so doing.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing executives, potentially including but not limited to settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and or consultancy arrangements.
These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
No Executive Director is employed on a service contract entered into prior to 27 June 2012.

Context Consideration of Directors remuneration The Remuneration Committee the Committee is a Committee of the Board with delegated powers set out in its terms of reference, available on the Companys website.
These are reviewed periodically and updated where necessary.
The Committees main responsibilities are to: determine and agree with the Board the Companys executive remuneration strategy and policy: determine individual remuneration packages and terms of employment within that policy for the Executive Directors, members of the Executive Committee and twelve other senior executives collectively known as the Purview Group : oversee the operation of the Companys incentive schemes, including designing and setting performance measures and targets for annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes: consider major changes in employee remuneration in the Group: select and appoint consultants to advise the Committee: report to shareholders through annual reports: and make recommendations to the Board on the fees offered to the Non-executive Directors, after taking independent professional advice: all of which it carries out on behalf of the Board.
The Committee comprised three independent Non-executive Directors during the year and to the date of this report, Jim Sutcliffe Chairman, Jonathan Leslie and Karen fide Segundo.
Mr Sutcliffe has considerable experience of designing and implementing  remuneration systems, having been chief executive of several businesses, including a FTSE100 company.
Dr fide Segundo has extensive executive experience in natural resources having been CEO of Shells global gas and power business, and spent five years leading Shells renewable energy business.
Mr Leslie combines his knowledge and outlook as chairman of the Safety & Sustainability Committee with the expertise gained as a director of Rio Tinto and as CEO of Sappi based in South Africa and Extract Resources.
The Board feels that this collective experience enables the Committee to offer a balanced, informed and independent view on remuneration.

The Committee reports to shareholders annually in this report and the Committee Chairman attends the AGM to address any questions arising.
Meetings of the Committee commence with the members holding a private session.
In FY2013 meetings were attended by the CEO or Acting CEO, the EVP External Affairs & Human Capital or, more recently the EVP Human Resources, the Company Secretary who acts as secretary to the Committee and the Assistant Company Secretary, none of whom do so as of right and who do not attend when their own remuneration is being discussed, all of whom provide material assistance to the Committee.
The meetings in November 2012 and July 2013 were also attended by representatives of  LLP, and in December 2012 by a partner of Herbert Smith Freehills LLP.
After each meeting, the Committee meets with the CEO on his own, and then in private session again.
When considering the appointment of Ben Magara as a Director and CEO of the Company, the Committee consulted the Chairman of the Board, Roger Phillimore, in relation to remuneration issues.

01 Strategic Report 02 Governance 03 Financial Statements 04 A Deeper Look 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 Context continued Relative importance of spend on pay To assist in understanding the relative importance of the Directors remuneration in the context of the Groups finances more generally, the Directors who sit on the Committee wish to highlight the following figures: Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 2013 2012 Difference Item $m $m $m Remuneration of Group employees of which: 716 734 18 Remuneration of Executive Directors 4 2 2 Remuneration of Non-executive Directors 2 1 1 Distributions to shareholders 31 31 Other significant distributions of profit or cash-flow: Capital expenditure 159 408 249 The apparent year-on-year reduction in the remuneration costs of the Group employees results from foreign exchange translation effects.
The Group employed additional people, and paid materially higher wages to its employees in FY2013 than in the prior year, but these are paid almost entirely in South African Rands.
Capital expenditure is chosen in the table as the Directors have a choice of whether to distribute profits and cash-flows by way of dividend, or reinvest these in the asset base to maintain or improve the operational health of the Company.
As with any mining business, a minimum level of sustaining capital expenditure is essential to preserve its value and may on occasion preclude the payment of dividends.
All of these amounts are presented as shown in the Companys audited financial statements.
Performance and pay The chart below shows how an investment in the Companys shares on 1 October 2008 has changed in value over the five financial years ended on 30 September 2013.
The Companys shares are listed and traded in the UK and South Africa, in almost equal proportions.
For comparative purposes we also show how investments in the shares of companies comprising the FTSE UK Mining Index and the JSE Platinum Index have changed in value over the same period.
These indices were chosen by the Committee as comparators as they comprise companies listed on the same markets as, and engaged in similar business activities to, the Company and, in the case of the JSE Platinum Index, producing the same commodities in the same geographical location.
In accordance with the Regulations, the chart assumes that dividends and other distributions were reinvested on the date that these became receivable, and that any liabilities for example, funding the subscription price for a rights issue were met through a tail swallow at the point immediately before that liability fell due.
