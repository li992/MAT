SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 09 Business Review Infrastructure The Group continues to develop its infrastructure: this investment is critical to the future growth ambitions of the Group and will take a number of years to complete.
The Group is making good progress with the merchandising management system and point of sale system, both of which are planned to go live after peak Christmas trading 2013.
During financial year 2014 there are planned system replacements for finance and human resources.
During April 2013 the Group announced that it had entered into a long-term agreement with Clipper Logistics to provide an operational solution for the fulfilment of the Groups multi-channel retail activities from a new distribution centre in Burton upon Trent.
The capacity of the new warehouse will be 500,000 square feet and will support the Groups growth aspirations in its next phase of development.
The new distribution centre is ideally located for national carrier networks to supply the Groups retail outlets more efficiently and to support fulfilment of the Groups internet operations, both in the UK and internationally.
This operating capability will support planned growth for at least the next five years.
The new facility will require a capital investment of circa 5m.
After the initial set-up and transition phase this investment will deliver an opportunity for the Group to generate significant cost savings, improve operating margins and provide a platform for the Group to meet the increasing demands of e-fulfilment.
The business has been further strengthened during the year with the recruitment of a Director of IT and Director of HR who have joined the executive team.
During June 2013 the Group appointed a Managing Director, International Product range and Wholesale.
In addition, the senior management teams have been strengthened by the recruitment of a Head The Group continues to enhance its ranges through the of Logistics, a Head of UK and Ireland Retail, a Head of constant refreshing of core products such as outerwear, Womens Design and, since the year end, a Group General hooded sweatshirts and casual tops, as well as the Counsel and a Group Financial Controller.
introduction of new categories and range extensions.
The brand is increasing its consumer appeal through the introduction of more subtle branding, tailored product and tactical collaborations.
Further developments have been made in the Timothy Everest range with the introduction of womens tailoring, which have received a positive reaction both from the customer and the fashion press.
The anticipated improvement in womenswear sales from the spring summer 2013 range was realised with strong positive like-for-like sales growth in the final quarter of the financial year.
The new ranges, with a distinctive feminine handwriting, have resonated with customers and further developments are planned with the autumn winter 2013 range.
Accessories sales continue to grow strongly and, following last years success with iPod iPad covers and bags, further accessories have been added to the range, including the launch of a new watch collection in November 2012 and a premium range of cosmetics in February 2013.
