Our Exploration Programme 3 Explore: Extend the Growth Pipeline 1 Exploration 2 3 4 Exploration is one of top priorities for Fresnillo plc.
We havebuilt an experienced exploration team, composed of82 geologists working alongside 75 technicians and administrative staff, and employ 385 local community members at our project sites.
We are focused on the discovery and potential acquisition of large, low-cost silver and gold ore bodies in Latin America, in regions with the greatest geological potential and mining tradition such as Mexico and Peru.
What we did in 2013 An extensive exploration programme was completed in 2013, including Gold reserves fell by 14.5% to 4.7 moz, due mainly to the revised 376,317 metres of core and 168,141 metres of reverse circulation drilling calculation criteria, whilst silver reserves declined 4.3% to 477.2 moz, on 25 properties, following geological mapping and geochemical related both to the change in price as well as to development delays geophysical surveys.
atFresnillo that were only partially mitigated by increased reserves atSaucito.
We have identied numerous new targets in the mining districts where we operate, which are under systematic exploration.
This approach has Community engagement programmes remained a critical part of the proven to deliver cost-effective discoveries as infrastructure is already exploration groups activities in 2013.
Local efforts near our sites included in place.
We have also explored in other selected districts where initial awareness campaigns and celebrations around events such as World drilling has been successful in identifying potential.
This prioritisation has Water Day, World Environment Day, Arbour Day, Literacy Day, Health Day, resulted in side-lining certain prospects and accelerating others.
We are Womens Day and Childrens Day.
In addition, we helped build a new river particularly excited about the results at Guanajuato, Orisyvo in Chihuahua, embankment in one community, contributed construction materials to and Rodeo in Durango.

It should be noted that we utilise the Australasian Code for Reporting of Our safety performance improved in 2013, due to strengthened Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves commonly procedures at all of our exploration sites, with no fatalities reported.
known as the JORC Code, to report our audited resource estimate, as is Withrespect to environmental standards, we operate under our ISO standard among our peer group.
A new edition of the JORC Code came 14001:2004 certication, and continue to improve our procedures, into effect on 1 December 2013, known as the 2012 Edition of the JORC including close monitoring of all environmental indicators related Code, and while only Australian Securities Exchange ASXlisted to drilling and camp operations.

Reserves and resources in 2013 were calculated at a gold price of Core analysis helps prioritise targets in our mining districts US$1,250 per oz and silver at US$19.50 per oz US$1,400 and US$27.00 in 2012.
Notwithstanding this more conservative basis for calculation, there was an increase in audited resources: gold by 5.2% to 28.4 moz and silver by 5.0% to 2,134.5 moz.
Of particular note were the results obtained at Centauro Deep, Lucerito, San Julin, Candamea, and CinegaSan Ramn.
In addition 2.9 moz gold and 131.5 moz silver were upgraded frominferred to indicated resources.
