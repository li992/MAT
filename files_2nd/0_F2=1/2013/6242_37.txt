During the period of 2013 that the mine was operating under normal conditions, average gold ore grade increased by 7.0% to 0.61 g t. This is expected to increase to a range of 0.65 g t to 0.80 g t in 2014 as the pit continues to deepen and the dynamic leaching plant gives us exibility to process higher grade gold ore.
