The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Financial review Margins and balances Margins Analysis Basis of preparation Customer assets represents loans and advances to customers and net interest income on customer assets represents interest received from customers less interest expense for funding those assets at the relevant internal funding rate.
Customer liabilities represent customer deposits.
Net interest income on customer liabilities represents the interest income from the funds generated from customer liabilities at the internal rate of funding less the interest paid to customers.
Customer net interest income is the sum of customer asset and customer liability net interest income.
Under this approach, customer net interest income reflects interest related to customer assets and liabilities only and does not include any interest on securities or other non-customer assets and liabilities.
Non-customer interest income principally reflects the impact of product and equity structural hedges, as well as certain other net interest income received on government bonds and other debt securities held for the purposes of interest rate hedging and liquidity for local banking activities.
All reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and related interest are recorded in the Investment Bank and are therefore not included in the Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management customer margins data.
The customer asset margin is defined as net interest income earned on customer assets excluding the impact of the product structural hedge relating to those assets, divided by total average customer assets.
Similarly, the customer liability margin is net interest income earned on customer liabilities excluding the impact of the product structural hedge relating to those liabilities, divided by total average customer liabilities.
The customer net interest margin is calculated as net interest income on both customer assets and liabilities excluding the impact of product structural hedges as a percentage of the sum of average customer assets and liabilities, consistent with the presentation of the net interest margin.
The non-customer generated margin is calculated as non-customer net interest income principally comprising the impact of both the product and equity structural hedges as a percentage of the sum of average customer assets and liabilities, consistent with the presentation of the net interest margin.

Customer net interest income Customer net interest income increased to 10,365m 2012: 9,839m driven by growth of 2% in average customer assets to 326bn and a 10bps increase in the customer asset margin to 2.19%.
Customer liability interest income remained broadly constant: the result of a 14% increase in average liabilities to 322bn offset by a 12bps reduction to 100bps in the customer liability margin.
The customer asset margin increased to 2.19% 2012: 2.09% primarily due to reduced funding costs.
The customer liability margin decreased to 1.00% 2012: 1.12% driven by increased customer rates paid on deposits accounts in Corporate Banking, a change in product mix within Wealth towards lower margin products and reduced funding rates.
Notes a Product structural hedges convert short term interest margin volatility on product balances such as non-interest bearing current accounts and managed rate deposits into a more stable medium term rate and are built on a monthly basis to achieve a targeted maturity profile.
b Equity structural hedges are in place to manage the volatility in net earnings generated by businesses on the Groups equity, with the impact allocated to businesses in line with their economic capital usage.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 267 Financial review Margins and balances continued Non-customer net interest income Non-customer net interest income decreased to 1,051m 2012: 1,210m reflecting a reduction in the non-customer generated margin of 5bps to 0.16%.
Group hedging activities continue to utilise structural interest rate hedges to mitigate the impact of the low interest environment on customer liabilities and the Groups equity.
Product structural hedges generated a lower contribution of 843m 2012: 962m, as hedges were maintained in this period of continued low interest rates.
Based on the current interest rate curves and the ongoing hedging strategy, fixed rate returns on product structural hedges are expected to make a significant contribution in 2014.
The contribution from equity structural hedges RBB, Barclaycard, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management remained broadly constant at 337m 2012: 317m.
Other Group net interest income Head office net interest income decreased 240m to a net expense of 165m reflecting the cost of funding surplus liquidity due to growth in customer deposits across the Group offset by an adjustment to the carrying value of subordinated liabilities.
Investment Bank net interest decreased to 349m 2012: 530m primarily due to a reduction in interest income from Exit Quadrant assets.
Total contribution to Group net interest income from structural hedge income is down 140m to 1.6bn 2012: 1.7bn.
Net interest margin The net interest margin for RBB, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management decreased 8bps to 1.76% 2012: 1.84%, reflecting the reduction in contribution from customer liabilities and Group hedging activities, combined with a reduced contribution from the higher margins in Africa RBB as the ZAR depreciated against GBP.
The net interest margin is expressed as a percentage of the sum of average customer assets and liabilities, to reflect the impact of the margin generated on retail and commercial banking liabilities.
The net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average customer assets increased from 3.47% to 3.50% in 2013.
Net interest margin and customer asset and liability margins reflect movements in the Groups internal funding rates which are based on the cost to the Group of alternative funding in wholesale markets.
The Groups internal funding rate prices intra-group funding and liquidity to appropriately give credit to businesses with net surplus liquidity and charges those businesses in need of wholesale funding at a rate that is driven by prevailing market rates and includes a term premium.
The objective is to price internal funding for assets and liabilities in line with the cost of alternative funding, which ensures there is a consistency between retail and wholesale source.
