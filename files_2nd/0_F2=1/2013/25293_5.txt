ICG underwrote the full 105m Private Senior loan and 6.6m of equity at a historically low entry valuation to support the secondary buyout by Investcorp.
Our rationale Esmalglass Itaca is a leading global producer of pigments for the ceramic tile industry, with a strong, experienced and committed management team.
Headquartered in Spain, the company is a truly global business with significant emerging market exposure and negligible Spanish revenues.
The company has industry leading profit margins and solid cash flow generation which, combined with an attractive valuation and low leverage multiples, makes for a very attractive risk reward profile.
