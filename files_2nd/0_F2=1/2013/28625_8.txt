Investment selection committees bring together the intellectual capital of Rathbones to produce bottom up recommended lists for UK and international equities, fixed income and collectives.
Over 40 investment professionals from across our business participate in the process and the outputs are derived from our combined expertise and experience, ensuring that we identify investments that are suitable for our clients.
These committees are comprised of experienced investment practitioners, supported by our highly-qualified research team.

Our approach is not prescriptive, with our investment managers remaining ultimately responsible for constructing each of their clients individual portfolios.
This is fundamental to our investment philosophy: while we believe that a rigorous framework is the key to providing consistent risk-adjusted returns and our strategic asset allocation committee meets quarterly to determine the weightings for our core investment strategies, we do not believe in one size fits all or that there is only one investment solution.
