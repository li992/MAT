Performance targets for 2014 awards Inevitably, measures linked directly to strategy are commercially sensitive.
In particular, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to disclose the targets for R&D new product performance at grant, as it may result in competitive harm.
However, the targets will be disclosed in full in GSKs 2016 Annual Report at the end of the performance period, together with details of the extent to which they have been met.
The Committee will provide updates on estimated vesting against the targets during the performance period.
The 2014 performance targets and vesting schedules are set out in the table below.
