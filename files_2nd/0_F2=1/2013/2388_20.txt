In January 2013, the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria, which is run as a joint operation between BP, Sonatrach the national gas company of Algeria and Statoil, came under armed terrorist attack.
A total of 40 people from 10 countries and 10 organizations were killed in the attack.
Four employees and a former employee lost their lives in the incident.
BP and Statoil jointly carried out an extensive review of security arrangements in Algeria following the attack and we are working with Sonatrach on implementing a programme of security enhancements.

Safety in the Downstream business Working with partners and contractors Key safety metrics 2009-2013 BP, like all our industry peers, rarely works in isolation we need to work Recordable injury frequency Process safety incident index Loss of primary containment with suppliers, contractors and partners to carry out our operations.
In 120 2013, 54% of the 373 million hours worked by BP were carried out by contractors.
100 Our ability to be a safe and responsible operator depends in part on the 80 conduct of our suppliers and contractors.
To this end we set operational standards through legally-binding agreements.
Training and dialogue also 60 help build the capability of our contractors.
40 Contractors We expect our contractors to comply with legal and regulatory 20 requirements and to operate consistently with the principles of our code 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 of conduct when working on our behalf.
Our OMS includes requirements Indexed 2009 100 The process safety incident index PSII is a weighted index that reects both the number and severity of events per 200,000 hours worked.
In 2013 our PSII was down 60% compared to a baseline year of 2009.
There were 101 LOPCs in 2013 down from 117 in 2012, with divestments accounting for a significant part of this reduction.
We measure personal safety performance through recordable injury frequency RIF and day away from work case frequency DAFWCF as well as severe vehicle accident rate SVAR.
The 2013 DAFWCF, the number of cases where an employee misses one or more days from work per 200,000 hours worked, was 0.063 compared to 0.089 in 2012.
Our SVAR which is the number of vehicle incidents that result in death, injury, a spill, a vehicle rollover, or serious disabling vehicle damage per one million kilometres travelled, was 0.10 in 2013 compared to 0.16 in 2012.
Driving safety remains an area of focus for us.
