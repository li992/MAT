OVERVIEW OUR PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 4 Governance 99 Detail of executive remuneration for 2013 In this sub-section, we summarise or provide details of each element of remuneration set out in the single figure table as required page 97.
Base salaries In accordance with policy, the committee considered a report from the chief executive and chief human resources officer on general pay trends in the market and the level of pay increases across the company as a whole.
For 2013, the company had reiterated its starting principles that base compensation provides the appropriate rate of remuneration for the job, taking into account relevant recruitment markets, business sectors and geographic regions and that total remuneration should reward both shortand long-term results, delivering competitive rewards for target performance, but higher rewards for exceptional company performance.
For the US and UK, the budget guideline issued at the end of September 2012 for adjustments to base pay for 2013 was 2% although business units were given the flexibility to take into account factors such as their own performance, where they are in the business cycle, and specific market factors.
As the year closed and pay budgets for 2013 were confirmed, most businesses remained on an overall 2% salary increase pool.
Local inflation rates were taken into account in particular markets.
The increases for the executive directors who served during all or part of 2013 were as follows: Rona John Fairhead Makinson John Robin Will stepped down stepped down Fallon Freestone Ethridge 26 April 2013 1 July 2013 Base salary at 31 December 2012 600,000 500,000 $1,045,500 529,100 548,900 150,00045,000$20,900 Increase 25% 9% 2% Base salary at 1 January 2013 750,000 545,000 $1,066,400 529,100 548,900 Note John Fallon was appointed to the board on 3 October 2012 and his base salary was reviewed on his appointment to CEO on 1 January 2013.
