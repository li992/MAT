8 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 Key Performance Indicators In addition to the financial KPIs that we show on the opposite page we also maintain a number of non-financial measures which we believe are important to the business.
As part of our Vision 2020 initiative we have set a number of additional non-financial measures such as the Brand Awareness and the Company Values Employee Engagement Index.
Our 2013 performance is reported where data is available and future years reports will provide comparative information.
The KPIs are also used to assist the Remuneration Committee in determining the rewards of our Executive Directors and senior managers as described in more detail on pages 52 to 67.

Their engagement can impact on business performance and customer satisfaction.
This is the first year that we report on these measures and for comparison we provide the norm for comparable businesses in the sector.
With the business having undergone significant change in 2012 and 2013, we remeasured our employee engagement levels through an independent survey.
The survey results were very positive the response rate was 84%, and our group wide Employee Engagement Index score was 79% this is an increase from 67% in 2011 when we last ran the survey.
This year we also introduced, for the first time, a Company Values Index, to track how we are living our corporate values.
This index was constructed from specific questions contained in the engagement survey.
The Company Values Index score was 72%, indicating that the majority of our people believe that we are doing well in putting our values at the heart of the way we do business.
Profile To date awareness of Alliance Trust, in common with other investment trusts, has been low among potential investors.
In order to take full advantage of the Retail Distribution Review, we intend to track awareness of the Alliance Trust brand among our target investors.
Platform The Board monitors and reviews the progress of the strategically important projects undertaken during the year to improve our business effectiveness.
