Geographic analysis We operate in three principal geographic areas: Asia, the Americas and Europe.
We consistently derive the significant majority of our revenue from business with customers based in Asia.
During 2012, revenue from American and European customers fell 6% to 12% 2011 18% due to lower sales to the handsets market following the Samsung Transaction.
More information on our geographical splits of revenue can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Major customers In 2012 our top ten customers provide 40% of total revenue 2011: 46%.
This decrease was due to a shift in mix towards the Voice & Music and Auto business lines where there are a higher proportion of smaller customers in the market.
