There was a substantial improvement in Ireland, where Savills had the majority share of the transactional market, which was itself characterised by demand from international private equity funds for distressed asset and portfolio sales.

By comparison, leasing markets particularly in France and Germany remained relatively subdued.
In Q4 2013, the residual Savills business in Italy was restructured to focus solely on valuation and consultancy.
In Germany, new management undertook a substantial reorganisation of both the investment and leasing teams, with each now under new leadership.
In addition the management team in Sweden was reorganised.

The primary contributors to this increase were Australia and China, with significant intra-regional crossborder activity in the prime markets.
