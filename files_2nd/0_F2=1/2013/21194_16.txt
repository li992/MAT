Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 89 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the table: Performance measures For the annual bonus, performance measures are chosen to align to the Groups KPIs and include financial, employee and customer measures.
Achievement against personal objectives is also taken into account.
LTIP performance measures are chosen to provide an indication of both absolute and relative return generated for shareholders.
In terms of target setting, a number of reference points are taken into account each year including, but not limited to, the Groups business plan and external market expectations of the Company.
Maximum payouts require exceptional performance that significantly exceeds performance targets or expected performance, under both the annual bonus and LTIP.
Discretions In addition to the discretions referred to in the DRR, the discretions the committee has in relation to the operation of the Annual Bonus Plan ABP and LTIP include, but are not limited to, who participates, the timing and size of awards, setting additional conditions and the discretion to change or waive those conditions, whether dividend equivalents will be awarded, the determination of vesting and adjustment in certain circumstances such as rights issues.
In addition, in relation to the LTIP, in accordance with its terms, the committee has discretion to waive or change a performance condition if anything happens which causes the committee reasonably to consider it appropriate to do so.
Any use of the discretions will be disclosed, where relevant, in the Annual report and accounts and, where appropriate, be subject to consultation with Avivas major shareholders.
In the event of a change in control, unless a new award is granted in exchange for an existing award, or if there is a significant corporate event like a demerger, awards under the LTIP would normally vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied as at the date of the change in control, and unless the committee decides otherwise, would be pro-rated to reflect the time between the start of the performance period and the change in control.
Awards under the ABP would normally vest on the date of the change in control and may vest if there is a significant corporate event.
The use of discretion in Avivas HMRC all employee share plans is set out in the rules and exercised in accordance with HMRC rules.
Consistency of executive remuneration policy across the Group The remuneration policy for our EDs is designed as part of the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group.
Remuneration arrangements for employees below the EDs take account of the seniority and nature of the role, individual performance and local market practice.
The components and levels of remuneration for different employees may therefore differ from the policy for EDs.
Any such elements are reviewed against market practice and approved in line with internal guidelines and frameworks.
The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Approach to recruitment remuneration On hiring a new ED, the committee would align the remuneration package with our remuneration policy.
In determining the actual remuneration for a new ED, the committee would consider the package in totality, taking into account elements such as the likely contribution of the individual, local market benchmarks, remuneration practice, and the existing remuneration of other senior executives.
The committee would ensure any arrangements agreed would be in the best interests of Aviva and its shareholders.
It would seek not to pay more than necessary to secure the right candidate.
The committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buyout remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the committee would take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted e. g. cash or shares and the timeframe of awards.
It would seek to structure buyout awards on a like for like basis when compared to awards forfeited.
The maximum level of variable pay which could be awarded to a new ED, excluding any buyouts, would be in line with the policy set out above and would therefore be no more than 500% of basic salary 150% of basic salary annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant.
On hiring a new non-executive director, the committee would align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy for NEDs, outlined below in table 3, including fees and travel benefits.
90 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 Illustration of the policy The charts below illustrate how much EDs could earn under different performance scenarios in one financial year: Minimum basic salary, pension or cash in lieu of pension and benefits, no bonus and no vesting of the LTIP Target basic salary, pension or cash in lieu of pension, benefits, bonus of 75% of basic salary and 50% vesting of the LTIP Stretch basic salary, pension or cash in lieu of pension, benefits, stretch bonus of 150% of basic salary and 100% vesting of the LTIP As stated Tom Stoddard will join Aviva on 5 May 2014 as CFO and the CFO data in the table below is based on his remuneration on joining.

This therefore excludes the relocation assistance for Mark Wilson, in connection with his relocation to the UK.
Actual figures may vary in future years.
2 LTIP calculations are based on awards with a face value of 300% of basic salary for Mark Wilson and 225% of basic salary for Tom Stoddard.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 91 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 Employment contracts and letters of appointment ED employment contracts and NED letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal hours of business, and at the place of the Companys 2014 AGM from 10.45 am on 30 April 2014 until the close of the meeting.
The key employment terms and conditions of the current EDs, and those who served during the year, as stipulated in their employment contracts, are set out in table 2 below.
Table 2: Executive directors conditions of employment Provision Policy Notice period By the ED 6 months.
By the Company 12 months, rolling.
No notice or payment in lieu of notice to be paid where the Company terminates for cause.
Termination payment Pay in lieu of notice up to a maximum of 12 months basic salary.
Any payment is subject to phasing and mitigation requirements.
An ED would be expected to mitigate the loss of office by seeking alternative employment.
Any payments in lieu of notice would be reduced, potentially to zero, by any salary received from such employment.
In the case of Mark Wilson, if his employment were to be terminated by the Company, other than for cause, within three years of his appointment then he would be entitled to be reimbursed against evidenced expenditure for reasonable and appropriate costs incurred in relocating outside the UK up to a maximum of 100,000, inclusive of any tax liability.
Remuneration and benefits The operation of the annual bonus and LTIP is at the Companys discretion.
Expenses Reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred in accordance with their duties.
Car allowance A cash car allowance is received, as varied from time to time.
Holiday entitlement 30 working days plus public holidays.
Other benefits Other benefits include private medical insurance and participation in the Companys staff pension scheme.
As disclosed in 2012, were the current Group CEO to incur additional reasonable relocation expenses above the 200,000 limit set out in the annual remuneration report section, then the committee would consider reimbursement of those expenses up to an agreed further limit.
Private medical insurance Private medical insurance is provided for the ED and his family.
The ED can choose to opt out of this benefit or take a lower level of cover.
However, no payments are made in lieu of reduced or no cover.
Sickness 100% of basic salary for 52 weeks, and 75% thereafter for a further 52 weeks.
Non-compete During employment and for six months after leaving without the prior written consent of the Company.
Contract dates Director: Date current contract commenced: Mark Wilson 1 January 2013 1 Patrick Regan 22 February 2010 2 Trevor Matthews 2 December 2011 Notes 1 Patrick Regan tendered his resignation as CFO on 22 January 2014 and will leave the Board and the Group before the AGM.
2 Trevor Matthews resigned from the Board with effect from 8 May 2013 and left the Company on 6 June 2013.
Policy on payment for loss of office There are no pre-determined ED special provisions for compensation for loss of office.
The committee has the ability to exercise its discretion on the final amount actually paid but any compensation would be based on what would be paid by way of basic salary, pension entitlement and other contractual benefits during the notice period depending on whether notice is worked or a payment made in lieu of notice.
Where notice of termination of a contract is given, payments to the ED would continue for the period worked during the notice period.
Alternatively, the contract may be terminated and phased monthly payments made in lieu of notice for, or for the balance of, the 12 months notice period.
During this period, EDs would be expected to mitigate their loss by seeking alternative employment.
Payments in lieu of notice would be reduced by the salary received from any alternative employment, potentially to zero.
The Company would typically make a contribution towards an EDs legal fees in connection with advice on the terms of their departure.
There is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus for the year in which loss of office occurs.
The committee may determine that an ED may receive a pro rata bonus in respect of the period of employment during the year loss of office occurs based on an assessment of performance.
Where an ED leaves the Company by reason of death, disability or ill health, or any other reason determined by the committee, there may be a payment of a pro rata bonus for the relevant year at the discretion of the committee.
The treatment of leavers under our ABP and LTIP is determined by the rules of the relevant plans.
Good leaver status under these plans would be granted in the event of, for example, the death of an ED, or their departure on ill health grounds.
Good leaver status for other leaving reasons is at the discretion of the committee, taking into account the circumstances of the individuals departure, but would typically include planned retirement.
In circumstances where good leaver status has been granted, awards may still be subject to a reduction prior to vesting in the event that inappropriate conduct of the ED whilst an employee is subsequently discovered post departure.
In the case of the long-term incentive plans, where the committee determines EDs to be good leavers, vesting is normally based on the extent to which performance conditions have been met at the end of the relevant performance period, and the proportion of the award that vests is pro-rated for the time from the date of grant to final date of service unless the committee decides otherwise.
92 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 Consideration of wider employee pay and shareholder views When determining the remuneration policy and arrangements for our EDs, the committee considers: Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group to ensure that pay structures are suitably aligned and that levels of remuneration remain appropriate.
The committee reviews levels of basic salary increases for other employees and executives based in the UK.
It reviews changes in overall bonus pool funding and long term incentive grants.
The committee does not directly consult with employees on pay issues but it does consider feedback from the employee opinion survey.
The committee also takes into account information provided by the HR function and external advisers Its ongoing dialogue with shareholders.
It seeks shareholder views and takes them into account when any significant changes are being proposed to remuneration arrangements and when formulating and implementing remuneration policy.
It has consulted broadly on the contents of this policy report.

94 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 Annual remuneration report This section of the report sets out how Aviva has implemented its remuneration policies for directors in the course of 2013 and how the remuneration policy will be implemented for 2014.
This is in accordance with the requirements of the Large & Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended.
Where new requirements have been introduced, Aviva has taken account of the guidance produced by the GC100 and Investor Group and emerging good practice.
Alignment of Group strategy with executive remuneration The committee considers alignment between Group strategy and the remuneration of its EDs is critical.
Our remuneration policy provides market competitive remuneration, and incentivises EDs to achieve both the annual business plan and longer term strategic objectives of the Group.
Significant levels of deferral and a shareholding requirement align EDs interests with those of shareholders and aid retention of key personnel.
As well as rewarding the achievement of objectives, variable remuneration can be reduced potentially to zero if performance thresholds are not met.
Committee membership and attendance The committee comprises independent NEDs only.
Table 5 below shows the committee members during the year and their attendance at committee meetings.

They were not present when their own remuneration was being discussed.
During the year, the committee received advice on executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP which is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its Code of Conduct.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the committee as its adviser with effect from 4 December 2012 following a competitive tender process and reappointed with effect from 4 November 2013 following an assessment by the committee of the quality of the advice provided.
In addition, the Group received advice on remuneration matters, taxation and other consulting services including advice in relation to Solvency II and the Economic Capital Infrastructure Programme ECIP from Deloitte LLP and from Linklaters LLP on remuneration matters during the year.
Deloitte LLP were paid fees totalling 196,980 during the year for the provision to the committee of advice on general HR and remuneration matters, benchmarking advice on market practice and views on shareholder perspectives.
Fees were charged on a time plus expenses basis.
The committee reflects on the quality of the advice provided and whether this properly addresses the issues under consideration as part of its normal deliberations.
The committee is satisfied that the advice received during the year was objective and independent.

He received no emoluments in respect of 2012.
2 Patrick Regan tendered his resignation as CFO on 22 January 2014 and will leave the Board and the Group before the AGM, and so received no bonus award for 2013.
His LTIP awards granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 will lapse.
3 Trevor Matthews left Aviva on 6 June 2013 and so 2013 figures represent the period up to that date.
4 Bonus payable in respect of the financial year including any deferred element at face value at date of award.
5 Value of the LTIP for 2013 relates to the 2011 award, which had a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2013.
34.48% of the award will vest in March 2014.
An assumed Aviva ordinary share price of 431.9 pence has been used to determine the value of the award based on the average share price over the final quarter of the 2013 financial year.
6 The LTIP value for Patrick Regan for 2012 has been updated to reflect the actual value at vesting of the award.
The figure previously disclosed was 607,302.
7 Pension contributions consist of employer contributions into the defined contribution section of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, excluding salary exchange contributions made by the employees, plus payments in lieu of pension above the lifetime or annual allowance caps.
Additional disclosures in respect of the single total figure of remuneration table audited information Benefits The benefits disclosure includes the cost where relevant of private medical insurance, life insurance, accommodation, travel and car benefits.
In the case of Patrick Regan this also includes benefits resulting from the Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE Scheme, as described below, which has been valued based on the monthly savings amount 250 and the discount provided 20%.
All the numbers disclosed include the tax charged on the benefits, where applicable.
As disclosed in the 2012 DRR, Mark Wilson was able to claim benefits of 200,000 inclusive of benefit-in-kind charges, against appropriate receipts or other evidence of expenditure, in respect of his relocation from Hong Kong to the UK.
Annual bonus Table 9 below sets out the Groups performance against its 2013 KPIs.
It also shows how these outcomes have translated into bonus payments.
Details of the actual targets have not been disclosed as they are deemed to be commercially sensitive.
Table 9: Group 2013 performance against its KPIs Weighting % of total bonus opportunity Business measures 70% Actual Plan Stretch outcome Key performance indicators % % % Net capital returns 10 13.75 12.47 IFRS profit before tax 7.5 20 20.00 MCEV value of new business 3.5 7.75 7.75 Combined operating ratio 1.5 3.5 0 Total expenses 2.5 5 5 Customer 5 10 2.32 Employee 5 10 0 Total 35 70 47.54 Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 97 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 The main driver of the Group CEOs bonus is the performance of the Group against key financial targets, with further consideration given to targets relating to employee engagement and customer satisfaction.
Additionally, the individual performance of the CEO is taken into account.
In considering the Group CEOs 2013 bonus the committee took full account of the Group outcomes and noted in particular the performance against financial targets.
The performance on net capital returns, IFRS profit before tax, the MCEV value of new business and total expenses were pleasing, with demanding targets having been achieved.
The combined operating ratio performance reflected some significant weather related events, notably two large flood events in our Canadian business.
Against a background of significant change and restructuring, the business required reductions in job numbers in 2013.
We are striving to minimise large scale restructuring going forward, but in 2013 these changes impacted our employees and our targeted engagement scores were missed.
We have set targets for 2014 which we believe will require significant efforts to achieve.
This element of the bonus did not produce any payment in 2013.
Aviva remains committed to providing a great service to our customers and it is disappointing that the progress we wanted to make in 2013 on this measure was not achieved in full.
Again, we have set 2014 targets that continue to challenge the business to make progress in this area.
Mark Wilsons personal performance was rated highly by the Board who particularly recognised the increase in the value of new business, the major improvement in the capital and liquidity base, the substantive progress on building a first-class management team and the restructuring of the cost base.
Based on the outcomes against the KPIs, and an assessment of Mr Wilsons individual strategic performance, the Committee approved a bonus of 75% of the maximum, equivalent to 112.5% of basic salary with a total value of 1,102,500.
This is set out in the annual bonus column of table 8.
Table 10: Individual strategic 2013 performance Weighting % of total bonus opportunity Actual Plan Stretch outcome Executive director % % % Mark Wilson 30% 15 30 27.46 1 Patrick Regan 30% 15 30 0 Note 1 Patrick Regan tendered his resignation as CFO on 22 January 2014 and will leave the Board and the Group before the AGM.
He will therefore receive no bonus in respect of 2013 performance.
One third of the bonus award for Mark Wilson will be delivered in cash, with two thirds being deferred into shares for three years.
As reported in the 2012 DRR, the Committee agreed with shareholders that it would consider additional underpin metrics in 2012 and 2013 once bonuses had been calculated to assure themselves of continuing alignment between bonuses paid and shareholder experience.
Those metrics were measures of Economic Value Added, Economic Capital and TSR.
The Committee considered Avivas performance against those metrics for 2013 and was satisfied that the progress made did not require any adjustment to bonus outcomes.
LTIP award vesting in respect of 2013 The LTIP value shown in the single total figure for remuneration is for the award expected to vest in March 2014.
The only current or former ED who will receive a vesting amount from this award is Trevor Matthews.
The performance conditions for this award are set out in table 11 below.

For any contribution above the HMRC annual or life time allowance cap, a cash alternative in lieu of pension contribution is offered subject to the same limit of 31% of basic salary minus the personal contribution.
All employee share plans EDs are eligible to participate in two HMRC approved all employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.
These plans include a partnership share element of the all employee share option plan AESOP under which eligible employees can invest up to the statutory limits, currently 125 per month, out of their gross salary in the Companys ordinary shares.
A matching element was introduced in April 2013 through which the Company matches every purchased share with two matching shares for the first 40 of a participants monthly contribution.
Matching shares are subject to forfeiture if the purchased shares are withdrawn from the AESOP within three years of purchase, as long as the participant remains employed by the Company.
From May 2013 participants were also eligible to receive Dividend Shares through the AESOP.
Shares awarded to, or investments made by, EDs through the AESOP are included in table 20 of this Report.
The Aviva 2007 SAYE Scheme allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.
In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a 3, 5 or 7 year HMRC approved savings contract, subject to a statutory savings limit, currently 250 per month.
From 2012, only 3 and 5 year contracts have been offered.
Details of options granted to EDs under these schemes are included in table 23.

2 Richard Karl Goeltz and Russell Walls retired from the Board with effect from 8 May 2013.
The remuneration figures shown in the table are for or relate to the period during which they were a director of the Company.
The total amount paid to NEDs in 2013 was 1,471,000 which is within the limits set in the Companys articles of association, which have previously been approved by shareholders.
Share awards made during the financial year audited information LTIP awards are made in shares which vest conditionally upon performance targets being met.
The number of conditional shares granted is based on a percentage of basic salary.
The following table sets out details of LTIP awards of conditional shares made during the year.
Table 13: LTIP awards granted during the year Amount vesting Face value Face value Threshold performance Maximum performance End of performance Date of award % of basic salary % of face value % of face value period Mark Wilson 04.04.2013 300% 2,940,000 20% 100% 31.12.2015 Patrick Regan 04.04.2013 225% 1,620,000 20% 100% 31.12.2015 Face value has been calculated using the average of the middle-market closing price of an Aviva ordinary share on the three consecutive business days immediately preceding the date of grant, on 4 April 2013.
Accordingly 983,277 and 541,806 shares were awarded to the Group CEO and CFO respectively based on a share price of 299 pence.
Following his resignation from the Company Patrick Regans 2013 LTIP award will lapse.
The LTIP vests subject to the achievement of two equally weighted performance measures, absolute ROE and relative TSR performance, which have been chosen to reflect shareholders long-term interests.
Details of the performance measures and targets are set out below.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 99 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 Return on equity targets ROE targets determine the vesting of 50% of the LTIP award and are set annually within the context of the Companys three-year business plan.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three-year period against a target return.
The 2013 LTIP award ROE targets are set out in table 14 below.
Table 14: 2013 LTIP ROE targets Achievement of ROE targets over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of ROE targets Less than 41% 0% 41% 10% Between 41% and 50% Pro rata between 10% and 50% on a straight line basis 50% and above 50% ROE is calculated as the IFRS profit after tax and non-controlling interest, excluding the impact of investment variances and economic assumption changes, over average IFRS equity excluding pension scheme net surplus deficit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company.
Total shareholder return targets audited information Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of the LTIP award.
Performance of the 2013 grant will be assessed against the following companies: Aegon, Allianz, Axa, CNP Assurances, Direct Line Group, Generali, Legal & General, MetLife, Old Mutual, Prudential, Resolution Limited, RSA, Standard Life and Zurich.
TSR vesting operates as set out in table 15 below.

Mr Walls was appointed as Chairman and Non-Executive Director of Aviva Insurance Limited on 1 May 2013, a subsidiary company of Aviva plc and the emoluments he received in respect of this directorship for the 2013 financial year were 72,328.
Richard Karl Goeltz retired from the Board with effect from 8 May 2013.
Mr Goeltz was appointed as Chairman and NonExecutive Director of Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited on 14 May 2013, a subsidiary company of Aviva plc and the emoluments he received in respect of this directorship for the 2013 financial year were 71,250.
On 13 February 2014, Mr Goeltz was also appointed as a non-executive director of Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited, Aviva Annuity UK Limited and Aviva Life Services UK Limited, each of which are subsidiary companies of Aviva plc.
Payments for loss of office audited information Trevor Matthews resigned from the Board with effect from 8 May 2013 and left the Company on 6 June 2013.
His notice period commenced on 7 February 2013.
Mr Matthews was paid only awards that were contractually required and no discretions were applied.
This constituted full and final settlement of Mr Matthews departure terms.
Any new ED appointment would be in accordance with our remuneration policy set out above.
Mr Matthews received pay in lieu of notice for the balance of his notice period 8 months of 480,000, paid in 8 equal monthly instalments He received no bonus in respect of 2013, and no LTIP award was made for the year The deferred element of Mr Matthews 2011 bonus vested on termination of his employment.
The value realised was 34,196 9,528 shares, inclusive of shares awarded in lieu of dividends accrued, vesting at a share price of 358.9 pence His 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards will vest at the end of the relevant performance period March 2014 and March 2015 respectively.
These will be pro-rated to reflect his service during the performance period and the extent to which the performance conditions have been achieved at the end of the period.
104,278 phantom shares not inclusive of shares awarded in lieu of dividends accrued will therefore vest in March 2014 and a maximum of 230,073 shares not inclusive of shares awarded in lieu of dividends accrued will therefore vest in March 2015 depending on performance conditions on the same basis as vesting for other directors Mr Matthews received the final tranche of his recruitment award the conditional share award disclosed in the 2011 DRR, which vested on his departure.

This index has been chosen because it is a recognised equity market index of which Aviva is a member.

Percentage change in remuneration of Group CEO The table below would ordinarily set out the increase in the basic salary, bonus and benefits of the Group CEO and that of the wider UK workforce.
As the current Group CEO became CEO on 1 January 2013 but joined the Board with effect from 1 December 2012, no comparison is possible this year.
The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as EDs are based in the UK albeit with a global role and responsibilities and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.
Table 18: Percentage change in remuneration of Group CEO % change in basic salary % change in bonus % change in benefits 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 Group CEO 1 All UK-based employees 2.69% 75.57% 3.65% Notes 1 The increase in bonus awards for all UK based employees in 2013 reflects a significant improvement in the performance of the UK businesses against their targets compared with 2012, when overall Group performance impacted bonus budgets.
Given this high level of performance in 2013, bonus awards for 2014 are not likely to continue at this level.
TSR rebased to 100 Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 101 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and accounts 2013 Relative importance of spend on pay The table below outlines adjusted operating profit before tax attributable to shareholders profits after integration and restructuring costs, dividends paid to shareholders and buybacks compared to overall spend on pay in total and per capita.
The measure of profit has been chosen as a straightforward measure reflecting the performance of the Company, showing both gross income, and also taking into account integration and restructuring costs.

3 There were no share buybacks in 2012 or 2013.
4 Total staff costs from continuing operations includes wages and salaries, social security costs, post-retirement obligations, profit sharing and incentive plans, equity compensation plans and termination benefits.
The average number of employees in continuing operations was 33,589 2012 and 29,970 2013.
External Board appointments The Company recognises that its EDs can benefit from serving in a personal capacity as a non-executive director of a non-Aviva Group company.
At the same time, it is conscious of the corporate governance recommendations that EDs should take account of the time commitment required by a non-executive director position and ensure that any such role does not impact their ability to carry out fully their executive duties.
The Company therefore has a policy of normally allowing EDs to serve as a non-executive director of one external company, subject to approval by the Board, and for the individual to retain any board fees.
Currently, Patrick Regan holds one external non-executive director appointment.
He was, until the disposal of the Groups interests in Delta Lloyd N. V. in January 2013, a Company-nominated member on the supervisory board.
He has continued to be a member of the supervisory board in a personal capacity since that date.
He received 62,227 during 2013 in respect of this appointment.
Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests audited information Executive directors share ownership requirements The Company requires the Group CEO to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of basic salary and each ED to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 150% of basic salary.
The EDs are required to retain 50% of the net shares released from deferred annual bonuses and LTIPs until the shareholding requirement is met.
Unvested share awards including shares held in connection with bonus deferrals are not taken into account in applying this test.
Table 20 below shows the position of each ED against the shareholding requirement as at 31 December 2013, based on that days closing middle-market price of an ordinary share of the Company of 449.7 pence.

This information includes holdings of any connected persons.
3 Shares Unvested and subject to performance conditions are awards granted under the Aviva LTIP which vest only if the performance conditions are achieved.
4 Shares Unvested and subject to continued employment are awards arising through the Aviva Annual Bonus Plan 2011.
Under these plans, some of the earned bonuses are paid in the form of conditional shares and deferred for three years.
The transfer of the shares to the director at the end of the period is not subject to the attainment of performance conditions but the shares can be forfeited if the ED leaves service before the end of the period.
5 Options vested but not exercised are options over shares granted under the Aviva SAYE Scheme.
In respect of Patrick Regan, his Aviva SAYE Scheme option reached maturity on 1 December 2013 and he has six months from the maturity date to exercise his option.

Share awards audited information Table 22 below sets out the EDs outstanding share awards.
The net value has been calculated by reference to the closing middle-market price of an ordinary share of the Company at the date of grant.
2 The award date for the LTIP and Bonus Replacement Deferred Share Award BRDSA awards granted in 2010 which vested in 2013 was 30 March 2010, the award date for the Replacement Restricted Share Award RRSA award was 11 March 2010 and the award date for the award granted in 2011 which vested in 2013 was 2 December 2011.
The awards which vested in 2013 were released with the net amount being settled in shares and the balance settled in cash and used to pay the resulting tax liability.
The monetary value of awards was calculated by multiplying the relevant number of shares by the closing middle-market price of an ordinary share of the Company at the date of vesting.
3 The information given in this column is at 31 December 2013 or the date on which a director ceased to be a director of the Company Trevor Matthews: 8 May 2013.
