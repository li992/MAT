Overview Multi-channel approach We aim to rebalance the portfolio towards out of town retail and retailer distribution, what we call our multi-channel approach.
We believe as e-tailing continues to grow and retailers multi-channel strategies evolve, there will be an increased emphasis towards distribution as an integral part of the supply chain.
Both our Saturn portfolio acquisition and the Primark Distribution centre in Thrapston embody this approach.
