16 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2013 Strategic report Organic revenue growth Operating efficiencies Competitive advantage Our people Organic revenue growth Organic revenue is the foundation of our strategy to deliver sustainable growth.
It is generated from winning new contracts, retaining existing clients and increasing consumer participation and spend in our restaurants.
Winning new business is a clear strength for Compass and, as the trend to outsourcing accelerates around the world, we see exciting opportunities in all of our regions and sectors.
Through the Strategic Alliance Group SAG, our best practice retention model originally developed in the US, our retention rate remains high, and we continue to provide clients and consumers with award winning innovation and service.
We will maintain our focus on disciplined and intelligent growth.
Retention of contracts is critical to the overall health of our business and the SAG model continues to be rolled out around the world.
It is a semi-independent team that is dedicated solely to retention.
They take a pre-emptive approach: firstly, by interviewing clients to determine how we can improve our quality and service and, secondly, by proactively renegotiating contracts.
Being a standalone team gives them the independence to receive honest feedback from clients and their operational experience means that they are trusted by our managers.
Where weve adopted this model, weve seen consistent improvement and were confident that its ongoing adoption will result in a better underlying retention rate for the Group overall.
For example, since the implementation of SAG, our Japanese business has seen its retention rate improve to 96% in 2013.
