Tsuyoshi Miki BU Manager Steel, Japan In my early career, I spent more than 25 years in high-end steel and metal industries mainly within sales and market development functions: gaining experience of both the domestic and global marketplace.
I joined Vesuvius in June 2018 as BU Manager Steel in Japan.
My role is to bring change and deliver growth in our business in the Japanese market.
I decided to join Vesuvius because I was attracted by the sense of respect and diversity it has, on top of my personal connection with the steel and metal industries.
As a new employee I was invited to attend the Spark Leadership Forum in Rome, Italy, where I had the chance to meet colleagues from all over the world.
I was able to exchange ideas and opinions in very open and respectful discussions with colleagues and also senior management, about future expectations and the importance of the Japanese market.
Since then, I have been implementing a series of actions to grow our business in Japan with support from colleagues all over the world and from the senior managers I met in Rome.
Vesuvius is a dynamic, transparent and cooperative organisation, where career progression is considered the norm for those who are focused and ambitious enough to take the opportunities on offer.
I am proud to say I work at Vesuvius and would recommend the Company to others.
