Total SALES VOLUMES REVIEW crude steel production in Russia rose by 1% to 72.1 million tonnes.
In 2018 external steel product sales volumes Russian steel market decreased by 7.6%.
The main reasons for this In 2018, Russian steel prices followed reduction were: the disposal of Ukrainian In 2018, Russias economy continued global benchmarks.

Hot-rolled coil averaged US$576 per furnace No.
Sales volumes for long steel, remained stable for flat steel tonne CPT Moscow, up 2% from US$563 per of semi-finished steel products to third parties and fell by 2% for tubular products.
Plates averaged US$584 per decreased by 18% in 2018.
Meanwhile, railway segment, demand for wheels surged by 29% tonne, up 5% from US$555 per tonne in 2017. product sales rose by 5%, buoyed by strong demand.
due to continued growth in railcar construction and a higher number of railcar overhauls.
Overall, EVRAZ sales volumes of key finished Meanwhile, demand for rails in Russia dropped Other steel markets products in Russia mainly increased during by 8%.
In construction steel, the beam market the reporting period.
Continued high demand edged down by 4% while demand for rebar In Kazakhstan, steel consumption stabilised from freight car building and repairing companies rose by 8%.
Demand for structural products at 2.7 million tonnes in 2018, down by 4% led to a 28% year-on-year surge in wheel sales.
Rail fell by 19% due to greater consumption following strong consumption growth in 2017. sales were up 4% amid higher purchases by Russian of substitutes amid higher prices.
Steel product exports dropped by 15% to 3.1 Railways.
Beam sales in Russia also improved million tonnes, as Kazakh producers reduced by 5% thanks to EVRAZ customer focus initiatives Russian export volumes grew by 3% to 30.4 production and refocused on the domestic and import displacement.
Rebar sales volumes million tonnes, driven by the weaker rouble market.
Structural product shipments were down by 7%.
The Group remains focused on maximising the share Russian steel consumption by product type, mt of sales in the long product segment on the local Siberian market.
The market share for beams 2018 14.0 16.9 10.2 in Russia expanded to 63%, compared with 56% 41.2 the previous year.
Due to the growth of supplies 2017 14.0 16.4 10.4 to Russian Railways, EVRAZ market share in rails 40.9 rose from 69% to 77%.

Flat Long Tubular In 2018, EVRAZ Caspian Steels rebar sales increased by 35% to 176 thousand tonnes due to higher demand for rebar in Kazakhstan Russian steel prices, US$ t and the signing of a major contract.

The reduction 550 is explained by higher sales volumes during 2017 higher oxide availability resulting from conversion 425 at third parties of slag stocks and Nitrovan sales from EVRAZ Vametco deconsolidated 300 in April 2017, production downtime at the beginning 2012 2017 2018 of the year due to the launch of blast furnace No.
