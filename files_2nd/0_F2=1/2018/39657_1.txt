UNLEASHING THE POWER OF SUBSCRIPTION hen Sage was founded back in 1981 by three friends studying at Newcastle University, accountancy software was in its infancy and consumer behaviour was very different.
Technology has evolved significantly since then, driving shifts towards cloud technology, Wpowered by subscription.
Subscription isnt a new concept: weve been paying for satellite TV, gym memberships and car insurance on subscription for many years but its only now that businesses are becoming attuned to the value proposition of consuming their financial software as a service SaaS, on subscription.
The power of a subscription relationship provides the foundation for Sage and itscustomers to grow and prosper alongside one another.
Embracing a closer relationship on subscription, Sage understands its customers better and can add more value to their business, meaning customers stay longer, buy more and feel happier doing so.
In order to build a successful SaaS business on subscription, Sage is focusing on thefollowing key ingredients which you can read more about throughout this report: 1.
Ensuring colleagues prioritise customer success by putting customers at the heart of every thing we do: 2.
Colleague success: Building a high-performing culture which values the individual and promotes collaboration: 3.
Investing in the best technology and continuously focusing on innovation.
We invite you to read on as we reflect back on FY18 and look forward to FY19, outlining the next steps in Sages journey to becoming a great SaaS business for customers and colleagues alike.
