The Directors who held office at the end of the financial year had interests in the ordinary shares of the Company at the beginning and end of the year under review as set out in the table above.
Details of the interests in the ordinary shares of the Company arising under the Groups share option schemes are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 62.
No rights to subscribe for shares in or debentures of other Group companies were granted to any of the Directors or their immediate families, or exercised by them, during the year.

APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS The appointment and replacement of directors is governed by the Companys Articles, the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation.
All directors intending to continue in office seek election or re-election by shareholders at each AGM.
The Articles may be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders.
Following the Board evaluation process undertaken in 2018, the Board is satisfied that each Director standing for re-election or election continues to show the necessary commitment, and to be an effective member of the Board due to their skills, expertise and business acumen.
Under the terms of the relationship agreement between the Company and GCT described further in the Major Shareholder Voting Arrangements section above, GCT has the right to appoint one Non-Executive Director but only if none of Moshe Greidinger, Israel Greidinger and Scott Rosenblum are on the Board for so long as it holds at least 10% of the voting rights in the Company.
Details of the Directors remuneration, are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 66 and information on their service contracts are set out in the Remuneration Policy contained in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The Articles permit the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, authorise situations where a Director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company.
There is in place a formal system for the Board to consider authorising such conflicts whereby the Directors who have no interest in the matter decide whether to authorise the conflict.
In deciding whether to authorise the conflict, the non-conflicted Directors are required to act in the way which they consider would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of all shareholders and they may, and do, impose conditions to be attached to such authorisations.
The Board believes that the arrangements for reporting and considering such conflicts operate effectively.
DIRECTORS INTERESTS IN CONTRACTS The Group has a number of property lease agreements in place with Global City Holdings B. V. GCH and or its subsidiary undertakings.
Further details of the amounts paid under these agreements can be found in Note 27 to the financial statements.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Due to the acquisition of Regal in February 2018, Cineworlds 2018 greenhouse gas GHG emissions have more than doubled from 2017.
The US business now accounts for 65% of Cineworlds 2018 carbon footprint.
Excluding Regal, Cineworlds GHG emissions have reduced 1% from 2017.
This section provides the GHG emission data and supporting information required by the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations 2013.
Information on the Groups environmental policies are summarised in the Resources and Relationships section on pages 28 to 30.
ORGANISATIONAL BOUNDARY The organisational boundary used for the Companys GHG reporting is operational control.
REPORTING SCOPE The Company is reporting on emissions covered by scopes 1 and 2 comprising electricity, gas, and fugitive F-gas emissions from global operations.
As well as scope 1 and 2 emissions figures, additional outside of scope emissions are included for owned transport to account for biofuel additions.
Scope 3 well-to-tank for all fuels and transmission and distribution from electricity emissions are also included.
EMISSIONS INCLUDED Mandatory emissions sources as specified by the Environmental Reporting Guidelines published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Defra have been included in this report see also Estimates and Exclusions below.
Table 1 shows Defras stated mandatory areas for reporting and how the stated categories apply to the Group.

This data shows the comparison between 2017 and 2018 emissions figures excluding the impact of Regal.
ESTIMATES AND EXCLUSIONS This report sets out GHG emissions from Cineworld Group plcs global operations from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018.
This is a new reporting period for Cineworld.
Previously, emissions were reported on a calendar year basis.
The revised reporting period has been implemented to allow accurate data to be used and reduce the use of estimated data.
Polish gas data was captured in local currency and converted into kWh.
This affects less than 1% of total emissions.
Some estimates were used to fill gaps in our transport fuel use data, electricity gas consumption and F-gas data in non-UK sites.
This amounts to less than 1% of total emissions.
EMISSIONS INTENSITY The chosen carbon intensity measure is financial turnover.
This was chosen due to ready availability of the data.
The value for the year was 99.63 tonnes CO e per $1m turnover.
2 For comparison, 2017s emissions were 144,107 tonnes CO e at an intensity of 125.63 tonnes CO e per $1m turnover using 2 2 corrected figures.
METHODOLOGY AND EMISSIONS FACTORS This report was calculated using the methodology set out in Defras updated greenhouse gas reporting guidance, Environmental Reporting Guidelines ref.
PB 13944, issued by Defra in June 2013.
Emissions factors are taken from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategys June 2018 update.
Emissions factors for fuels use scope 3 well-to-tank upstream additions to account for emissions from sourcing and processing fuel.
Owned transport emissions include outside of scope additions for biogenic additions.
Electricity emissions include transmission and distribution losses.
