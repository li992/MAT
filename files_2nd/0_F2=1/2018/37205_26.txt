We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in our report.
HOW WE TAILORED THE AUDIT SCOPE We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured as one operating segment, being investment management.
The Group is composed of the Company, incorporated in the United Kingdom, and subsidiary entities in the United Kingdom and abroad, and certain consolidated Jupiter funds.
The Group is operated centrally from the UK.
We conducted an audit of the complete financial information of Jupiter Asset Management Limited and Jupiter Unit Trust Managers Limited because they each represent more than 15% of the profit before tax of the Group.
Taken together, our audit work accounted for more than 95% of Group revenues and Group profit before tax.
MATERIALITY The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Overall 9.0m 2017: 9.6m.

determined it Rationale for We believe that profit before tax is the primary As the Company is a holding company and does not earn any benchmark measure used by the shareholders in assessing revenue, total assets is the most appropriate method to determine applied the performance of the Group, and is a generally materiality, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 4.5m and 8.9m.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 0.4m Group audit 2017: 0.5m and 0.2m Company audit 2017: 0.1m as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
