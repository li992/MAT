Portfolio Report Market Overview Despite periods of volatility in 2018, emerging-markets equities delivered steady returns over the year to 31 March 2018, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index growing by 11.8%.
This was thanks to a combination of tailwinds.
Over the same period TEMIT produced a net asset value total return of 12.4% all figures in sterling.
Full details of TEMITs performance can be found on page 1.
One of the most significant tailwinds was the synchronised global economic growth, which remained strong a and resulted in the most broad-based global upswing since 2010.
Against this backdrop, commodity prices rebounded.
Brent crude oil, for example, pushed past USD 70 per barrel for the first time in more than three years before settling at USD 69 at the end of the reporting period.
These developments were good news for emerging markets equities, which also continued to benefit from rising consumer spending and the technology revolution which drove greater corporate efficiencies and innovation.
Emerging markets corporate earnings grew over the period but valuations remained attractive compared to those in developed markets, providing interesting investment opportunities.
Investors reacted positively and flows into emerging markets funds surged.
While the emerging markets rally was mostly steady, bouts of volatility surfaced in 2018.
Global stocks experienced brief falls in February as worries of resurgent US inflation outweighed initial optimism about an improving world economy.
Investors who had largely shrugged off the US Federal Reserves interest rate increases in 2017 began to assess the likelihood of more aggressive rate hikes ahead.
Markets were also unnerved by rising trade tensions as the US announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, as well as a range of Chinese products.
This was followed by moderate retaliatory action on the part of the Chinese government.
On balance, however, emerging markets were buoyant, with Asia riding the wave of technological innovation.
Chinese stocks rose sharply amidst robust economic growth.
Chinas gross domestic product GDP expanded by 6.9% in 2017, marking its first annual acceleration in seven years.
Exports rose on the back of strong global demand: fixed asset investment and retail sales also increased.
Chinas economic strength allayed concerns about its ability to grow amidst wide-ranging reforms.
Tackling industrial overcapacity, the government shut down illegal and inefficient steel mills and coal mines.
Capital market reforms bore fruit as MSCI decided to include China A-shares in its benchmark indices from June 2018.
On the political front, President Xi Jinping consolidated his power, aided by the parliaments removal of a two-term limit on the presidency.
China was TEMITs largest market position at the end of the reporting period.
Investment opportunities were plentiful as growing affluence and consumer demand propelled a broad array of industries ranging from e-commerce to luxury cars.
South Korean equities advanced, though returns were capped by geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula.
Efforts by newly elected South Korean President Moon Jae-in to broker peace with North Korea helped to defuse some pressure.
We note that geopolitical tensions in the region are not new and are generally reflected in stock prices.
In fact, periods of market weakness can create opportunities to invest in well-run companies at compelling valuations.
Moreover, South Korea is looking to improve corporate governance and the government took steps in this direction during the reporting period.
Against this backdrop, TEMIT a Source: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Update, January 2018.
co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 21 Portfolio Report continued increased its weighting in South Korea, particularly in the information technology sector where certain companies stand out as world-leading brands.
Taiwans stock market, where technology companies dominate, was influenced by sentiment towards the information technology sector.
Strong demand for smartphones and other gadgets around the world increased Taiwans technology-related exports in 2017.
However, companies supplying parts used in Apples iPhones were held back by lower than expected demand for the new iPhone X.
The Taiwan dollars strength against the US dollar also weighed on exporters earnings.
Notwithstanding the mixed news flow, Taiwanese companies continue to play an integral role in the global technology supply chain.
As we have previously outlined, technology is likely to remain a major investment theme in emerging markets as innovations reshape an increasing number of industries.
For this reason, TEMIT maintained a substantial position in Taiwanese companies.
By comparison, Indias exposure to global technology trends was modest.
Instead, its stock market was largely driven by economic reforms and political developments at home.
Indian equities inched higher as policy changes drew uneven reactions from investors.
The rollout of a national goods and services tax, though bumpy, was largely welcomed for its potential to reduce bureaucracy and raise government revenue.
However, the reintroduction of a long-term capital gains tax on equities hurt sentiment.
Adding to caution, stock valuations in India were higher than those in other major emerging markets.
As we have not seen many compelling investment opportunities meeting our investment criteria, TEMIT remains underweight in India.
In Latin America, Brazilian stocks rallied.
An economic recovery, accommodative monetary policy and structural reforms lifted market confidence.
Brazils GDP grew in 2017 after two straight years of contraction, buttressed by strength in the agriculture sector and increased consumer spending.
At the same time, tame inflation allowed the central bank to cut its key interest rate to a record low to support the economy.
Reforms progressed in areas like the labour market, though the government failed to push through a pivotal overhaul of Brazils costly pension system.
TEMIT was positioned for improvements in Brazil and increased its weighting in the market during the financial year, especially in financial companies.
Conversely, Mexican equities faltered and lagged their Latin American counterparts.
The pesos weakness against sterling had a slight impact on returns.
Stocks were hindered by subdued economic data and by continued uncertainty around the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA.
US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports included exemptions for Mexico and Canada that would be positive, but that are conditional on the progress of NAFTA talks.
Meanwhile, investors continued to keep a close eye on Mexicos presidential election race as most opinion polls placed left-wing populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in the lead.
TEMIT only invests in a small number of opportunities in Mexico, resulting in an underweight position compared to the benchmark index.
Elsewhere, Russian equities overcame a lull early in the period to finish higher.
Markets however remained concerned about additional sanctions from the US and Europe, though a recovery in oil prices helped to alleviate the impact to same degree.
Russias economy returned to growth in 2017 after shrinking for two consecutive years.
With inflation touching record lows, the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate and indicated a potential for further monetary policy easing.
Russias political environment was largely stable and President Vladimir Putin achieved a landslide re-election victory in March of 2018.
Importantly, Russias stock 22 Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC www.
co. uk Portfolio Report continued valuations remained attractive relative to the emerging-market universe, and Russian companies appeared wellpositioned for earnings growth amidst the economic turnaround, however we are mindful of the ongoing sanctions but are still seeing selective opportunities and as a result, TEMIT added to its position in Russia within the period.
South Africas stock market received a boost from the election of the African National Congress leader Cyril Ramaphosa as the countrys president following Jacob Zumas resignationa development that raised hopes for the introduction of pro-business reforms.
Although TEMIT increased exposure to South Africa during the reporting period, this was purely via Naspers which, through its more than 30% ownership of Tencent, gives indirect exposure to China rather than the domestic South African market.
From a sector perspective, information technology led the emerging markets rise.
Internet-related companies delivered stellar returns as the digital revolution continued, whether in e-commerce, mobile payments or cloud computing.
The growing services that smartphones and other devices support required  components.
This effect benefitted chip makers and other electronic component producers.
The financial sector was another strong performer as improving macroeconomics lifted prospects for banks and other financial institutions.
Separately, the consumer discretionary sector was boosted by strong consumer spending, which remains a major economic driving force in emerging markets.
Portfolio Changes and Performance The following sections show how different investment factors stocks, sectors and geographies accounted for the Companys performance over the period.
Stock selection was once again the primary driver of TEMITs outperformance relative to its MSCI benchmark see table below.
This reflects the emphasis that we put on our bottom-up stock selection investment process.
A description of our investment management philosophy, process and approach to risk management is set out on pages 18 to 20.
We select companies based on their individual attributes and ability to generate risk-adjusted returns for investors, rather than taking a top-down approach in allocating funds to sectors, countries or geographic regions.
Avoiding stocks from the index which do not fit our investment criteria can be as important as identifying companies which do.

Brilliance China Automotive manufactures and sells automobiles for the Chinese market, predominantly through its joint venture with German luxury car maker BMW.
It reported strong volume and profit growth over the first half of its financial year, supported by generally robust demand.
We expect the rise of Chinas upper middle class to continue driving the luxury car market in the country, and we are optimistic about the companys ability to capture that growth through new vehicle launches.
Ping An Insurance Group is a China-based personal financial service provider with three core businesses insurance, banking and investment.
It is one of the largest life, property and casualty coverage against loss of property, damage or other liabilities insurers in China by premiums.
The companys full-year net profit beat market expectations, supported by strength in its life and health insurance business.
We expect further growth from the companys core insurance operations as, well as their financial technology businesses.
Its core product is its search engine.
In its home market, Russia, it has more than 50% of all search traffic.
It also owns the leading online taxi services provider in the country, as well as e-commerce and classified advertising businesses.
Yandex reported double-digit revenue growth in 2017, largely driven by strength in its core search and taxi operations.
Taxi and Uber Russia provided investors with additional good news.
We expect to see continued growth in Yandexs search engine and taxi businesses.
Further, the online advertising market should continue to take market share from traditional media outlets, benefitting the company.

Astra International is an Indonesia-based conglomerate with businesses in the automotive, financial services, heavy equipment, infrastructure, IT and property industries.
Its largest business, the automotive division, distributes motorcycles, cars and trucks under brands such as Honda and Toyota.
It also provides after-sales services and auto components.
Astras full-year net profit missed market expectations as car sales weakened in the face of increased competition.
Nevertheless, we remain positive about long-term automotive demand in Indonesia as the economy continues to grow.
IMAX is an entertainment technology company specialising in motion-picture technologies.
It designs and manufactures premium theatre systems and has installed these systems around the world, of which a substantial number are in emerging markets.
Weaker-than-expected box office results weighed on IMAX and it embarked on a cost-cutting exercise.
However, we expect demand for premium cinematic experiences to grow in emerging markets and the company, we believe, is well-positioned to increase its market share.
We are also positive about its share buy back programme.
Banco Santander Mexico is one of the leading financial groups in its home market.
It offers a wide range of services, including retail and commercial banking.
Mexican equities generally underperformed their emerging markets peers over the year on concerns surrounding the ongoing NAFTA renegotiation and the 2018 presidential election.
Disappointing earnings over the last two quarters of 2017 further pressured returns from the stock.
However, we believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from the growth in the banking sector, where penetration currently remains low.

The financial sector was the largest contributor to performance, followed by the telecommunication services and materials sectors.
Stock selection in the financial sector, which is a significant investment theme in the portfolio, proved favourable and we increased our positions during the reporting period.
Our underweight position in telecommunication services also helped investment performance relative to the benchmark index as the sector lost ground.
We sought investment opportunities elsewhere as we saw high levels of regulation and few growth catalysts in this area.
Conversely, the health care, real estate, consumer staples and information technology sectors held back relative results.
We added to holdings in information technology and health care during the period.

Our selection of stocks in Russia, China Hong Kong and South Africa were major contributors to TEMITs returns relative to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Higher oil prices, an easing monetary policy, stronger earnings growth prospects and undemanding valuations buoyed Russian equity prices while a change of leadership boosted South Africas stock market.
In contrast, relative performance was hampered by stock selection and an overweight position in Thailand and Indonesia, as well as an overweight position in Pakistan.
We pared our position in Pakistan, where political instability weighed on the stock market.

co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 35 Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples Energy Financials Health Care Industrials Information Technology Materials Real Estate Telecommunication Services Utilities Total Equities Other Net a Liabilities 2018 Total 2017 Total Portfolio Report continued Market Outlook We believe that prospects for emerging markets remain sound despite the recent increase in volatility.
Emerging markets have historically bounced back from external shocks, and they displayed a healthy resilience amidst choppy trading in early 2018.
We still see strong tailwinds underpinning emerging-market equities even as we are mindful of the challenges that may arise.
Importantly, emerging-market economies look poised for further growth.
The International Monetary Fund a is estimating 4.9% GDP growth for emerging markets in 2018, up from 4.7% in 2017.
Oil exporters were particularly bolstered by higher oil prices and we expect the upturn to continue, even if it may not be smooth.
We are mindful of the fact that protectionist trade actions taken by the United States have cast a shadow over the synchronised global growth that has lifted stock markets.
However, the long-term outcome of these political manoeuvres remains to be seen.
The scope and strength of international trade flows should not be underestimated, as the growth in intra-Asia trade over the years shows, reducing the importance of the US and other developed markets to emerging markets.
We are upbeat about Asia and the investment opportunities present in markets from China to Indonesia.
We believe that the outlook for China is stable as the leadership continues to strive for a balance between economic growth and structural reforms.
The recent elimination of term limits on the Chinese presidency suggests that President Xi Jinping could seek to serve beyond the end of his second term in 2022.
This development could be generally positive over the short to medium term as top leadership would remain stable and major government policies could be more consistent.
But, structurally, this is a significant shift from the concept of collective leadership in the Chinese Communist Party and could raise the risk of policy errors in the absence of checks and balances.
This is an area that we will closely monitor over the longer term.
Similarly, we see investment opportunities in countries like Brazil and South Africa, where reform momentum is encouraging.
Brazil continues to face some challenges, including high unemployment and uncertainty ahead of a presidential election in October 2018.
However, the country emerged from a prolonged recession in mid-2017 and we are largely confident in the prospects for corporate earnings growth amidst an improving business climate.
Meanwhile, several trends bode well for emerging markets, such as technology.
Emerging markets companies have embraced the use of technology and importantly have also become global innovators in many areas, ranging from e-commerce to mobile banking, robotics, autonomous vehicles and more.
E-commerce, for example, continues to gain new customers and a greater share of wallets as companies come up with ways to improve shoppers experiences.
Amidst this progress, the IT sector has yielded many investment opportunities in internet-related firms, hardware makers, semiconductor companies and other enterprises, many of which are based in South Korea, Taiwan and China.
We expect more opportunities to emerge as the digital revolution continues.
Rising wealth in emerging markets is another secular driver.

And as consumers meet their basic needs, aspirational wants are likely to follow.
This premiumisation trend could boost demand for higher-end items such as luxury cars or services such as entertainment and wealth management.
We also find emerging markets equities attractive as we expect earnings to improve further, while valuations remain at a discount to those in developed markets.
Sustained earnings growth should prompt valuations to return to a more normal level.
As value-oriented, bottom-up and long-term investors, we continue to seek companies that demonstrate sustainable earnings power, trade at a discount relative to their potential and alternative investments available in the market, and provide exposure to our major investment themes.
With our rigorous research and investment processes, we believe that TEMIT is in a good position to weather any periods of volatility and benefit from the continued dynamism of emerging markets.
