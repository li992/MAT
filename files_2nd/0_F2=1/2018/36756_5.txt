08 Hochschild Mining PLC OUR STRATEGY OUR STRATEGY FOR GROWTH Our strategy for growth focuses on four key paths to secure low-cost growth.
2018 activities 2019 priorities Brownfield 1.3m gold equivalent ounces inferred resources 2019 brownfield exploration budget expected to be $27 million added at Inmaculada Drilling to the east and west of Angela vein at Inmaculada to find further potential Optimising and exploring close Further geological upside expected from drilling Drilling in the north to test Angela vein continuity to our current mines to increase in surrounding area On track for an exciting 2019 drilling campaign at Pallancata our life-of-mine and the quality Community permits achieved for exciting 2019 of our resources.
Outcropping structures indicate high potential at Palca and Cochaloma Pallancata drilling campaign to the south of Pallancata Life-of-mine increases 2018 results at San Jose boost short-term Further investigation of San Joses Aguas Vivas polymetallic sulphide deposit Improve quality of resources production plan Spare capacity available On track to achieve 10 years of life-of-mine by 2021 2018 activities 2019 priorities Greenfield Maintaining balanced portfolio of advanced 2019 greenfield exploration budget expected to be $10 million early stage opportunities Drilling to continue at Snip and Cobalt A streamlined portfolio Combination of JVs and private placements Drilling to begin at Condor, Corina, Agni & Indra generating a number of to lock in project options Mapping and permitting activities at 13 other projects including promising targets as well as Option taken up on Condor small producing Ferguson Mountain and Mars in US and Casma, Alto Ruri and progressing drill-ready projects mine located 93km from Arcata Josnitoro in Peru in good jurisdictions in the Alliance established with Skeena Resources Americas.
