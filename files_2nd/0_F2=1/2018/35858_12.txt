In be seen from Graph 1. addition, ongoing environmental reforms in China encouraged the use of direct charge materials, such as pellet, to reduce the harmful impact of sintering on air quality.

Pellet Supply in 2019 Traditional blast furnace pellet markets are Supply of pellets in 2019 and 2020 is expected to be impacted by closures of mines Europe principally Germany and North and pellet plants in Brazil due to heightened concerns about the safety of upstream East Asia Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, tailings dams.

in Sweden, Canada and Bahrain although as Bahrain is a merchant pellet plant, recovery is dependent on the global availability of pellet feed as well as increases in supply from India and Iran.
Together these producers are expected to increase production by approximately 7 million to 9 million tonnes following various production difficulties in 2018.
In addition, a producer in Chile is expected to reduce production due to ship loader difficulties at its port.
Ferrexpo believes, as a result of the above, that there could be a reduction of around 5 million to 10 million tonnes of pellet supply in the export market in 2019.

The power of business costs is that by adjusting all product qualities relative to the same benchmark 62% Fe fines product delivered to North China, it allows Ferrexpo stands to benefit from operating all mines to be compared on a cost curve on a like-for-like basis.
This also means that by subtracting the benchmark price from the business costs for a mine you get an estimate of cash flow from that operation.
