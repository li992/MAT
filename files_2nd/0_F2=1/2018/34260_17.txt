For a summary of our interests in refineries and average daily crude distillation capacities see page 284.
Underlying growth in our refining business is underpinned by our multi-year business improvement plans, which comprise globally consistent programmes focused on operating reliability and efficiency, advantaged feedstocks and commercial optimization.
Operating reliability is a core foundation of our refining business and in 2018 operations remained strong, with refining availability of 94.9% 2017 95.3% and refinery utilization rates at 91% 2017 90%.
As a result we achieved record levels of refining throughput on a current portfolio basis despite high turnaround activity.
Our refinery portfolio along with our supply capability enables us to process advantaged crudes.
For example, in the US, our three refineries all have location-advantaged access to Canadian crudes which are typically cheaper than other crudes.
Our commercial optimization programme aims to maximize value from our refineries by capturing opportunities in every step of the value chain, from crude selection through to yield optimization and utilization improvements.
In 2018 we delivered continued improvement in our net cash margin per barrel, a measure of the competitiveness of our refinery portfolio, and extended lower carbon bio-processing into more of our refineries.
The refining result was higher in 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting Fuels marketing and logistics increased commercial optimization and strong operations, which in Across our fuels marketing businesses, we operate an advantaged North America allowed us to capture the benefits from higher North infrastructure and logistics network that includes pipelines, storage American heavy crude oil discounts, partially offset by lower industry terminals and tankers for road and rail.
