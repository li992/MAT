The market for new investment in public private partnership projects remains slow.
In Scotland, there is an ongoing hiatus on new projects coming forward under the Non-Profit Distribution Model, with public sector bodies continuing to procure through the existing Hub frameworks instead.
Galliford Try has positions on three of these frameworks.
We have also seen no projects coming to market under either PF2 in England or the Welsh Mutual University of Strathclyde major Largs Campus, part of Investment Model.
In Wales, we expect building works framework hub South West projects to come to market towards the end of the 2018 calendar year.
A number of government departments are preparing business cases for PF2 projects in England, with prisons the closest to coming to market.
In addition, the NHS in England is looking to procure primary care facilities through six regional frameworks, which will provide opportunities for PPP Investments.
In response to the slow market, we have continued to progress development-style projects in sectors such as private rented, student accommodation and, in conjunction with the Infrastructure Manchester Airports Group AMP6 Yorkshire Water, Scottish business, rail.
We have a number of Capital Delivery Framework Water and Southern Water projects in the pipeline and expect them to start coming to fruition in the coming months.
