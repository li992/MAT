Full analysis of risk categories The Groups risk framework covers all types of risk which affect the Group and could impact on the achievement of its strategic objectives.
A detailed description of each category is provided on pages 115 to 159.
Risk categories recognised by the Group are periodically reviewed to ensure that they reflect the Group risk profile in light of internal and external factors, such as the Group Strategy and the regulatory environment in which it operates.
As part of a review of the Groups risk categories, the secondary risk categories in the table below of Change, Data management and Operational resilience have been elevated to primary risk categories, and Strategic risk has been included as a new primary risk category, in the Groups Risk Management Framework.
These changes will be embedded during 2019.

The Groups assessment of a significant increase in credit risk, and resulting categorisation of Stage 2, includes customers moving into early arrears as well as a broader assessment that an up to date customer has experienced a level of deterioration in credit risk since origination.
A more sophisticated assessment is required for up to date customers, which varies across divisions and product type.
This assessment incorporates specific triggers such as a significant proportionate increase in probability of default relative to that at origination, recent arrears, forbearance activity, internal watch lists and external bureau flags.
Up to date exposures in Stage 2 are likely to show lower levels of expected credit loss ECL allowance relative to those that have already moved into arrears given that an arrears status typically reflects a stronger indication of future default and greater likelihood of credit losses.
Additional information The measurement of ECL reflects an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future economic outcomes.
The Group achieves this by selecting four economic scenarios to reflect the range of outcomes: the central scenario reflects the Groups base case assumptions used for medium term planning purposes, an upside and a downside scenario are also selected together with a severe downside scenario.
The base case, upside and downside scenarios carry a 30 per cent weighting: the severe downside is weighted at 10percent.
The table below shows the decomposition of the final probability-weighted ECL for each forward-looking economic scenario.
The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted PD and, hence, the Stage 2 allocation is constant across all the scenarios.

Upside Downside m m ECL allowances 3,861 4,659 Retail The credit quality of the Retail portfolios remains strong and continues to benefit from robust credit risk management, including affordability and indebtedness controls at origination and a prudent approach to risk appetite.
The economic environment remains resilient with record employment rates, falling inflation, positive real wage growth and household indebtedness remaining below pre-crisis levels.
New business quality remains strong: The flow of loans entering arrears remains at low levels: Stage 3 balances are broadly flat at 1.7 per cent: and Stage 2 balances have reduced to 9.2 per cent of the portfolio, largely due to model refinements to the Stage 2 transfer approach for Secured.
Loans and advances remained flat during the period at 343 billion as of 31 December 2018.
The impairment charge increased by 151 million 21.2 per cent to 862 million for 2018 2017: 711 million.
The increase is attributable to the inclusion of MBNA for a full year and a low impairment charge in Secured compared to one-off write-backs in 2017.
Expected credit loss ECL allowance as a percentage of drawn balances for Stage 3 increased to 19.7 per cent from 18.5 per cent relating to prudent provisioning in Secured.
Coverage for Stage 2 has increased to 3.9 per cent from 3.2 per cent, largely due to model refinements to the Stage 2 transfer approach for Secured resulting in a reclassification of better quality Stage 2 assets into Stage 1.

The average indexed loan to value LTV remained stable at 44.1percent 1 January 2018: 43.6 per cent and the proportion of balances with an LTV of greater than 90 per cent remained low at 2.9 per cent 1 January 2018: 2.5per cent.
The average LTV of new business improved to 62.5 per cent 31 December 2017: 63.0 per cent.
The closed Specialist mortgage portfolio continued to run off, reducing by a further 1.7 billion 11.0 per cent.
Total Secured loans and advances decreased by 2.9 billion 1.0 per cent to 289billion 1 January 2018: 292 billion, due to reductions in the Buy-to-let and closed Specialist portfolios.
The impairment charge was 38 million compared to a release of 15 million in 2017 arising from one-off write-backs.
Total expected credit loss allowance as a percentage of loans and advances coverage remained flat.
Unsecured loans and advances were broadly flat for the year ending 31 December 2018.
The impairment charge increased by 91 million to 683 million 2017: 592 million, mainly due to the inclusion of MBNA for a full year.
Coverage decreased slightly to 3.5 per cent at 31 December 2018 1 January 2018: 3.8 per cent, with model refinements in Stage 2 offset by those in Stage 3.
The UK Motor Finance portfolio continued to grow, with loans and advances increasing by 8.7 per cent to 14.9 billion at 31 December 2018 1January2018: 13.7 billion.
Increases in Stage 2 and Stage 3 balances reflect growth in the retail portfolio.
The impairment charge in the period wasbroadly flat at 113 million 2017: 111 million.
The portfolio continues to benefit from a conservative approach to residual values at origination and through the loan lifecycle, with prudent residual value provisions accounting for 99 million of Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit loss allowance at 31December 2018.
Coverage for the portfolio was flat at 1.9 per cent.
Other loans and advances increased by 1.4 billion to 10.4 billion driven by a transfer of largely Stage 1 assets from SME into Business Banking.
The impairment charge increased by 5 million to 28 million in the year due to the non-repeat of one-off write-backs in 2017 relating to a closed portfolio.

Interest only mortgages The Group provides interest only mortgages to owner occupier mortgage customers whereby only payments of interest are made for the term of the mortgage with the customer responsible for repaying the principal outstanding at the end of the loan term.
At 31 December2018, owner occupier interest only balances as a proportion of total owner occupier balances had reduced to 26.7 per cent 31 December 2017: 29.0percent.
Theaverage indexed loan to value improved to 41.3 per cent 31December2017: 41.7 per cent.
For existing interest only mortgages, a contact strategy is in place throughout the term of the mortgage to ensure that customers are aware of their obligations to repay the principal upon maturity of the loan.
Treatment strategies are in place to help customers anticipate and plan for repayment of capital at maturity and support those who may have difficulty in repaying the principal amount.
A dedicated specialist team supports customers who have passed their contractual maturity date and are unable to fully repay the principal.
A range of treatments are offered such as full or part conversion to capital repayment and extension of term to match the maturity dates of any associated repayment vehicles.

Retail forbearance The basis of disclosure for forbearance has changed compared to previous years to be aligned to definitions used in the European Banking Authoritys FINREP reporting.
The change leads to an increase in disclosed forbearance of 5.6 billion, with the main drivers being longer probation periods before a customer can return to order and the inclusion of Past Term Interest Only for Secured.
The main customer treatments included are: repair, where arrears are written on to the loan balance and the arrears position cancelled: instances where there are suspensions of interest and or capital repayments: Past Term Interest Only mortgages: and refinance personal loans.
Total forbearance for the major retail portfolios has improved by 578 million to 7.0 billion driven by customers exiting probation and returning to order on the Secured portfolio.
As a percentage of loans and advances, forbearance loans improved to 2.2 per cent at 31 December 2018 1 January 2018: 2.4 per cent.
98.1per cent of forbearance loans are captured in Stage 2 or Stage 3 for IFRS9 and hold provision on a lifetime basis.
Total expected credit losses ECL as a proportion of loans and advances which are forborne has increased to 9.4 per cent 1 January 2018: 8.6per cent due to prudent provisioning on the Secured portfolio.
The Group measures the success of a forbearance scheme for Retail Secured customers based upon the proportion of customers performing less than or equal to three months in arrears over the 24 months following the exit from a forbearance treatment.
For temporary treatments, 80.4 per cent of UK Secured customers accepting reduced payment arrangements are performing.
For permanent treatments, 83.2 per cent of UK Secured customers who have accepted capitalisations of arrears and 84.4 per cent of customers who have accepted term extensions are performing.

Commercial Banking The overall credit quality of the portfolio and new business remains good with the portfolio benefiting from effective risk management, a through the cycle approach to risk appetite and continued low interest rates.
Notwithstanding the current competitive market conditions, the Group is maintaining its prudent risk appetite.
Uncertainty persists around the UK and global economic outlook, including the outcome of EU exit negotiations, the sustainability of global economic growth, trade wars and geopolitical risks.
Allied to this are headwinds in a number of sectors including construction, support services and consumerrelated sectors, such as retail.
However, the portfolios remain well positioned and the Groups through the cycle risk appetite approach is unchanged.
Monitoring indicates no material deterioration in the credit quality of the portfolio.
Internal and external key performance indicators are monitored closely to help identify early signs of any deterioration.
Portfolios remain subject to ongoing risk mitigation actions as appropriate.
Planning for any EU exit outcome is well advanced and continues to evolve in Commercial Banking to ensure portfolio quality is maintained whilst supporting the Groups Helping Britain Prosper strategy.
Net impairment charge for 2018 of 92 million compared with a net charge of 89 million in 2017.
Stage 3 gross charges included the impact of IFRS 9 model refinements and were broadly flat year on year.
Stage 3 net charges increased, driven by lower impairment releases and write-backs.
Net impairment releases in Stage 1 and 2 were weighted towards non-SME portfolios and reflect a number of factors including transfers between stages including to and from Stage 3, refinements to the IFRS 9 model methodology as well as adjustments to Multiple Economic Scenario impacts to reflect any changes to the underlying economic outlook.
The size and nature of the commercial portfolio results in some volatility as cases move between stages.
Stage 3 loans as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers has increased to 3.2 per cent 1January 2018: 2.7 per cent.
Stage 3 expected credit loss ECL allowance as a percentage of Stage 3 drawn balances has reduced to 32.3 per cent 1 January 2018: 35.3 per cent largely as a result of a transfer in of assets to impaired status on which lower ECL allowances areassessed.
Stage 2 loans as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers reduced to 6.5 per cent 1 January 2018: 7.7 per cent as a result of transfers to Stage 1 and Stage 3.
The proportion of Stage 1 loans increased to 90.3 per cent 1 January 2018: 89.6 per cent.
Stage 2 ECL allowances as a percentage of Stage 2 drawn balances were lower at 5.1 per cent 1 January 2018: 5.6percent due to changes in the mix of assets classified as Stage 2 andrevisions to model assumptions.
Notwithstanding the current stable performance of the portfolio, impairments are likely to increase from their current levels, driven mainly by lower levels of releases and write-backs and an element of credit normalisation.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 143 Movements in capital resources The key difference between the transitional capital calculation as at 31 December 2018 and the fully loaded equivalent is primarily related to capital securities that previously qualified as tier 1 or tier 2 capital, but that do not fully qualify under CRD IV, which can be included in additional tier 1 AT1 or tier 2 capital as applicable up to specified limits which reduce by 10 per cent per annum until 2022.
The key movements on a transitional basis are set out in the table below.

However, when dividends are paid to the Group by Insurance these are recognised through CET1 capital.
The 750 million of dividends received from Insurance during the year include 600 million in respect of their 2017 full year ordinary dividend and 150 million in respect of their 2018 interim ordinary dividend.
2 Includes the accrual for the 2018 full year ordinary dividend and the reversal of the accrual for the 2017 full year ordinary dividend which was paid during the year.
3 The movement in eligible provisions reflects the adjustment made in respect of the application of the IFRS9 transitional arrangements.
CET1 capital resources have increased by 520 million over the year, primarily reflecting: profit generation during the year receipt of the dividends paid by the Insurance business in February 2018 and July 2018 movements in treasury shares and the employee share schemes a reduction in the deferred tax asset deduction a reduction in excess expected losses resulting from the partial absorption of the increase in impairment provisions following the adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 remaining expected losses deducted from capital relate specifically to equity exposures, offset by the impact on retained earnings net of transitional relief largely offset by the interim dividend paid in September 2018, the accrual for the 2018 full year ordinary dividend, the completion of the share buyback programme during the year, the increase in the defined benefit pension scheme surplus deduction, movements through the fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI reserve and an increase in intangible assets which are deducted from capital AT1 capital resources have increased by 690 million in the period, primarily reflecting the issuance of a new AT1 capital instrument during the year, partially offset by the annual reduction in the transitional limit applied to grandfathered AT1 capital instruments.
Tier 2 capital resources have increased by 1,365 million in the period largely reflecting the issuance of new dated subordinated debt instruments, foreign exchange movements and a reduction in the significant investments deduction following the redemption by Scottish Widows of a subordinated debt instrument issued to the Group, partially offset by the amortisation of dated instruments.
