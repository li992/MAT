Admiral generally elects to commute reinsurance where it makes economic sense to do so.
In 2018 profit commission of 95.0 million was recognised, up from 64.7 million the prior period.
The increase in 2018 mainly arose due to improvements in booked loss ratios on prior years, which have also been impacted by the change in Ogden rate in 2018.

Revenue is recognised in the income statement in line with the booked loss ratios on Admirals retained underwriting.
Note 5c to the financial statements analyses profit commission income by underwriting year.
COMMUTATIONS OF QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE Admiral tends to commute its UK Car Insurance quota share reinsurance contracts for an underwriting year 24 months from inception, assuming there is sufficient confidence in the profitability of the business covered by the reinsurance contract.
After the commutation is executed, movements in booked loss ratios result in reserve releases or strengthening if the booked loss ratio were to increase rather than reduced or increased reinsurance claims recoveries or profit commission.
During the first half of 2018, all quota share contracts relating to the 2016 underwriting year were commuted, along with one remaining contract relating to the 2015 underwriting year the other quota share contracts relating to the 2015 year having been commuted in the second half of 2017.
There were no commutations during the second half of 2018.
At 31 December 2018, quota share reinsurance contracts remained in place for the 2017 and 2018 underwriting years.
In 2018 Admiral recognised reserve releases from commuted reinsurance contracts of 109.6 million 2017: 73.8 million.
Excluding the accounting impact of commutations refer to the glossary for further information, the releases relating to commuted reinsurance contracts were 141.5 million 2017: 97.5 million.
The increase from 2017 is primarily due to more significant improvements in booked loss ratios on 2016 and prior underwriting years, in part due to the change in Ogden assumption.
Refer to note 5d v of the financial statements for analysis of reserve releases on commuted quota share reinsurance contracts.

Overall contribution Other Revenue net of costs plus instalment income increased by 19% to 243.2 million 2017: 204.8 million.
Whilst there were a number of smaller offsetting changes within the total, the main reasons for the increase were higher instalment income primarily due to changes in the arrangements with Munich Re in 2017 such that Admiral now retains all instalment income on the car insurance business compared to 60% previously, plus the growth in the size of the business.
Other revenue was equivalent to 67 per vehicle gross of costs: 2017: 64, the increase being substantially due to the increase in instalment income noted above.

UK Household insurance was launched in December 2012 under the Admiral brand.
The UK Household insurance business continued to grow strongly and increased the number of properties insured by 31% to 865,800 2017: 659,800.
Turnover increased by 36 % to 146.0 million 2017: 107.1 million.
The 2018 result was a loss of 3.0 million 2017: profit of 4.1 million following the weather and subsidence events that have impacted the UK Household market during the first and second halves of 2018 respectively.
Adjusting for normal weather experience the result would have been a profit of 7.7 million.
Market premiums increased as a result, and Admiral also increased premiums.
The volume of new business policies sold in the market continued to increase as more households changed insurer, and the share of these sales made via the price comparison channel also continued to increase.
Admiral enjoyed strong customer retention and new business volumes and saw an increasing share of new business sales made either directly or via cross sell to existing Admiral customers within the Groups MultiCover product offering.
The reported loss ratio of 92.3% 2017: 73.5% included around 11 percentage points of weather impact and eight percentage points related to subsidence.
Prior year releases contributed a benefit of 4 percentage points, meaning that the underlying attritional loss ratio increased to 77.6% from 75.6% as a result of a combination of slightly lower average premiums and higher costs relating to escape of water and fire claims.
Admirals expense ratio also continued to improve 28.1%, down from 30.0% and similar to the motor business, significantly outperforms the market.
