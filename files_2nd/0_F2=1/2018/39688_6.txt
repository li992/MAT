Constant Currency Organic revenue growth compares the revenue in the year with the prior year, applying the same FX rates in both periods.
Revenue from any acquisition made in the year is excluded.
Where an acquisition was made part way through the prior year, the revenue from that acquisition is grossed up to a full year contribution as if it had been owned for the entirety of both periods 2.
Underlying results for the year have been presented after the exclusion of non-underlying items.
These items include, amongst other costs, acquisition and integration costs, share based payments where linked to acquisitions and amortisation of intangible assets.
Further details can be found in note 9 of the consolidated financial statements 3.
Figures for 2016 and 2017 have been restated to reflect the underlying effective tax rate rather than the reported tax rate in arriving at underlying diluted EPS 4.
Figures for 2017 have been presented after adjusting for the restatement correcting the prior period errors detailed in note 15 of the financial statements 5.
