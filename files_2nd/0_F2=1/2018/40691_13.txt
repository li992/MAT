Around half of this value is owned by Universities and the remainder by private operators.
Whilst investor demand for high-quality, well-located student accommodation remains high, the level of transactions in the student accommodation sector in 2018 has reduced slightly from the record levels in 2016 and 2017.
However, with over 3 billion of assets trading during the year, there are continuing levels of high demand for good-quality assets and portfolios and the reduction is largely the product of less stock coming to market after a few years of unusually high levels of activity.
As a result of ongoing investor appetite and subsequent transactions, there has been a modest level of yield compression across the sector.
This movement has been most notable in London and a small number of markets aligned to the highest-ranking Universities, where there has been the strongest level of demand for assets.
The buyers of assets are generally international and are either adding to existing platforms or are new to the sector.
We are still seeing high levels of interest for any assets that are brought to market.
This market activity has resulted in yield compression that has been reflected in our portfolio and the average yield at 31 December 2018 was 5.0%, an inward movement of 15 basis points on a like-for-like basis over the year.
Indicative valuation yields 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 London 4.0-4.25% 4.25-4.5% Prime provincial 4.5-5.0% 4.75-5.25% Major provincial 5.0-5.5% 5.0-5.5% Provincial 6.0-6.5% 6.0-6.5% Buildings designed for students The focus of our property activity is to provide buildings designed specifically around the needs of todays student, in the best locations alongside high-performing Universities.
We involve our University partners in the design and planning process to ensure that we are delivering buildings that meet the requirements of their students.
We also aim to provide value-for-money accommodation and look to continually enhance the specification of our estate, using technology to enhance customer service and drive efficiency savings through energy and water savings, enhanced Wi-Fi speeds and new features to improve the living experience.
The location within cities is critically important and this is one of the key factors in our investment divestment decision-making process.
This was evidenced by the sale of 3,400 beds in 2018 that resulted in us exiting two markets and repositioning our portfolio in four other cities to reduce our concentration in these locations.
Our development and portfolio activity is designed to support this strategic approach to ensure that the portfolio is best placed to drive full occupancy and rental growth in the medium term.
