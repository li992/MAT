Martin Paynes salary on appointment was lower than David Halls CEO salary, and, as set out in the Annual Statement by the Chair of Remuneration Committee on page 83 of this report, the Committee has over time increased Mr Paynes salary to the same level as was received by David Hall.

Following previous positive experiences with Polypipe, contractor Careys Civil Engineering recommended that the original clay and concrete design specification be changed to a more durable and cost-effective thermoplastic solution, incorporating Polysewer and Ridgisewer.
The structured wall pipes offer ring stiffness and strength, while ensuring flexibility to allow for ground movement and differential settlement.
They can also be manufactured to exact specifications and delivered at precise times, reducing labour time on-site.
To capture, store and control surface water run-off, over 220m of Ridgistorm-XL large diameter pipes were supplied in a stiffness class of SN2 to suit the sites ground conditions, together with two tanks manufactured using Polystorm-R cells.
We recommended a thermoplastic solution, as we knew it would be safer, easier and quicker for our groundworkers to install, while offering the robust infrastructure required for this large-scale project.
