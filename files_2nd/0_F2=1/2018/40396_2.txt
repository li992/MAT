Introduction Serving shoppers a little better every day.
With our turnaround firmly on track, we continue to deliver value for every stakeholder in our business.
We have taken important decisions to help our customers through the year from reformulating thousands of products to reduce salt, fat and sugar, to launching great value exclusive food brands.
Thanks to these efforts, our offer is more competitive, and more customers are shopping at Tesco as a result.
At the same time, we are also focused on new opportunities for growth.
Most significantly, our merger with Booker allows us to become the UKs leading food business.
This report sets out what we have achieved in the year, and gives an update on our medium-term ambitions our six strategic drivers.
We are making strong progress, and firmly believe that by serving shoppers a little better every day, the momentum in our business will continue.
