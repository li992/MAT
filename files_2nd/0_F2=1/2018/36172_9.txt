20 STRATEGY IN ACTION SUPERIOR PRODUCTS THROUGH T TE EC CH HN NOL OLO OG GY Y INCREASING GENETIC CONTROL AND PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION After a decade of development, in September 2017 we launched our ground-breaking and proprietary sexed bovine genetics technology, under the IntelliGen brand.
We have used this technology to sex our own genetics, which are sold to customers under the Sexcel brand.
Since its launch, Sexcel has delivered astatistically significant improvement in fertility performance to our customers, compared with older technology.
This is supported by analysis on tens of thousands of data points and, crucially, feedback from our customers.
Uptake in Sexcel product globally has exceeded our expectations and now accounts for over 1 25% of ABSs dairy semen revenues globally.
We are also providing our proprietary IntelliGen technology to other studs around the world, enabling them to sex their genetics.
So far, these include the Norwegian bovine genetics group Geno and the Mehsana District Co-operative Milk Producers Union in India.

Mllevang will act as a strategic distribution partner forPIC in Denmark, a Top 10 pig production market globally where PIC previously had no presence.
Mllevang will also act as a strategic supply chainpartner for PIC in Europe.
Its nucleus and multiplication infrastructure will grow the availability ofPIC products in Europe.
Finally, Mllevangs genetics will be incorporated into PICs genetic programme.
This will provide Mllevangs and PICs customers with access to accelerated genetic improvement and Mllevang customers will get access to PIC technical services.

DR BILL CHRISTIANSON CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF PIC Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 24 STRATEGY IN ACTION DISCOVERING VALUE THROUGH I IN NN NOV OVA AT TIO ION N SHARING IN THE VALUE DELIVERED ABS XBlack is a revolutionary new index created specifically to maximise the profitability of beef producers in Brazil.
Launched under our NuEra Genetics global brand, it is the first economic index to explore total system profitability in crossbreeding indigenous Nellore cows with European genetics in the form of semen.
The index harnesses data on performance in tropical conditions.
Before we launched ABS XBlack, Brazilian customers could only select their European genetics on data derived from animals raised in very different environments, such as in the US.
Now, following the collection of more than 40,000 progeny performance records from over 100 bulls around Brazil, customers can identify European genetics that perform best specifically when bred to indigenous Nellore cows, and that produce an offspring best suited to local production systems.
ABS XBlack is a powerful value discovery tool for our customers.
On average European genetics sold through the XBlack index achieved a price premium of over 30% compared with other European genetics.
