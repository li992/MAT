Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 safer | cleaner | healthier 107 Governance Other Statutory Information continued Employee share plans Details of employee share plans are set out in note 23 to the accounts.
The Company introduced a new Executive Share Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, and reflects current legislation, bestpractice and corporate governance requirements including recovery and withholding provisions.
In addition, the new Plan includes flexibility to grant performance-related share awards, other share awards and deferred bonus awards.
The Plan is used primarily to grant performance-related awards and deferred bonus awards to executive Directors and selected senior employees.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the ability to continue to grant long-term share-based incentives as part of a balanced remuneration package creates a strong alignment of long-term interest between senior management and shareholders.
Dilution limits The Company operates three share plans: the 2005 Performance Share Plan, under which no further awards can be made and, during the year, all remaining awards were satisfied: the 2015 Executive Share Plan, under which all new discretionary awards are made: and the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, a tax approved share plan forUKemployees.
Overall dilution through the issuance of new shares for employee share schemes including treasury shares may not exceed an amount equivalent to 10% of the Companys issued share capital over a 10-year period and for discretionary share awards to senior management, 5%overa 10-year period.
Over the last 10 years, the Company has granted discretionary awards over 3.2% of the Companys issued share capitaland a further 0.4% inrespect of the SIP.
All awards under these three plans have been settled by treasury shares or market-purchased shares held via a trust.

Power of Directors The powers of Directors are set out in the Articles of Association and a description of the Matters Reserved for decision by the Board, copiesofwhich are available on request from the Company Secretary, and are summarised in the Corporate Governance Report on page 75.
Essential contracts and change of control There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company, principally bank loan agreements, private placement debt and employee share plans.
There are two significant agreements, in terms of the likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole, containing such provisions: the 550m syndicated Revolving Credit Facility which, if within 10 days of a change of control notice to the Loan agent, can result in 30 days notice being given to the Company by any Lender, for all amounts outstanding to that Lender, to be immediately due and payable, at which time the commitment of that Lender will be cancelled.
If all of the Lenders give this notice the whole facility would be cancelled: and the US$250m US Private Placement Note Purchase Agreement under which, in the event of a change of control, theCompany is required tomake an offer to the holders of the US Private Placement notes to prepay the principal amount of the notes together with interest accrued.
The Group has contractual arrangements with a wide range of suppliers.

108 safer | cleaner | healthier Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Allotment authority Under the Companies Act 2006 the Directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so.
At the Annual General Meeting anordinary resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the Directors to allot and issue new shares up to an aggregate nominal value of9,400,000 up to 94,000,000 new ordinary shares of 10p each, being just less than one quarter of the issued share capital oftheCompany excluding treasury shares as at 11 June 2018 the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting.
In accordance with the Directors stated intention to seek annual renewal, the authority will expire at the earlier of the conclusion ofthe annual general meeting of the Company in 2019 and 31 August 2019.
Passing this resolution will give the Directors flexibility to act inthe best interests ofshareholders, when opportunities arise, by issuing new shares.
As at 11 June 2018, the Company had 379,645,332 ordinary sharesof 10p each in issue of which 3,990 were held as treasury shares, which is equal toapproximately 0.001% of the issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares as at that date.
The Companies Act 2006 also requires that, if the Company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings.
At the Annual General Meeting a special resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the Directors to issue a limited number of shares for cash and or sell treasury shares without offering them to shareholders first.
The authority is for an aggregate nominal amount of up to 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued share capital of the Company as at 11 June 2018 of 3,780,000.
The resolution will also modify statutory pre-emption rights to deal with legal, regulatory or practical problems that may arise on a rights issue or otherpre-emptive offer or issue.
The authority will expire at the same time as the resolution conferring authority on theDirectors to allot shares.
The Directors consider this authority necessary in order to give them flexibility to deal with opportunities as they arise, subject to the restrictions contained in the resolution.
There areno present plans to issue shares, other than the release of treasury shares under share plans previously approved in general meeting.
Purchase of the Companys own shares The Company was authorised at the 2017 annual general meeting to purchase up to 37,900,000 of its own 10p ordinary shares in the market.
This authority expires at the end of the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the Directors stated intention to seek annual renewal, aspecial resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew this authority until the earlier of the end of next years annual general meeting and 31 August 2019, inrespect of up to 37,900,000 ordinary shares, which is approximately 10% of the Companys issued share capital excluding treasury shares asat 11 June 2018.
The Directors consider it desirable that the possibility of making such purchases, under appropriate circumstances, isavailable.
The authority, ifgranted, will only be exercised if market conditions make it advantageous to do so.
The Directors will only make purchases under the authority where they believe that to do so would result in an increase in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders, or where the purchased sharesare used to satisfy awards made underemployee share plans, and such purchases are considered to be in the best interests ofshareholders generally.
Their present intention is that the shares purchased under the authority will be held in treasury for future cancellation, sale for cash or transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant to, an employee share plan, although in the light of circumstances at the time it may be decided to cancel them immediately on repurchase.
The effect of any cancellationwould be to reduce the number of shares in issue.
For most purposes, while held intreasury, shares aretreated as if they have been cancelled for example, they carry no voting rights and do not rank for dividends.
Following approval of the Performance Share Plan PSP at the 2005 annual general meeting, the Directors made routine purchases of Halma shares in the market for holding in treasury until required for vesting under the PSP.
The final PSP awards vested in August 2017 so there will be no future purchases of shares to satisfy PSP awards.
In the year to 31 March 2018, no shares were purchased in the market for treasury.
Under the Executive Share Plan approved atthe2015 annual general meeting, shares vesting may be satisfied with market purchased shares held in trust or intreasury or with new issue shares.
Otherwise, the Directors have no present intention of using this authority.
In reaching a decision to purchase shares, the Directors will take into account the Companys cash resources, capital requirements and the effect of any purchase on the Companys earnings per share.
It is anticipated that renewal of theauthority will be requested at subsequent annual general meetings.
Annual General Meeting The Companys Annual General Meeting will be held on 19 July 2018.
The Notice of Meeting, together with an explanation of the proposed resolutions, is enclosed with this Annual Report and Accounts and is also available on the Companys website at www.
