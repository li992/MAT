Strategic Report Key performance indicators Measuring performance and growth Informas Directors and management team use a number of financial and non-financial measures to track the Groups performance and the delivery of strategy.
Some of these are alternative performance measures, chosen because we believe they are the most useful and appropriate explanations of the Groups business performance.
Each Informa Division additionally tracks a range of other metrics that are relevant to its business model, such as subscription renewal rates, rebooking rates and customer satisfaction.
