Access 18, Avonmouth Continuing to accelerate our commercial development activity, we now have a pipeline of 1.5m sq ft of committed industrial and logistics projects, up from 1.0m sq ft at the start of 2018.
One such project is the development of a 151,000 sq ft unit at Access 18 in Avonmouth, the largest speculative build unit in the region.
Access 18 is a 212-acre site strategically located close to junction 18 of the M5.
Acquired by St. Modwen in 2003, the former zinc smelting works required an 18-month programme of demolition and remediation works to prepare the site for development.
This involved an extensive environmental clean-up whereby over 750,000 tonnes of earth were removed and over 99% of materials were recycled on site.
Rupert Joseland, Property Director West and Wales, said: To date, approximately 1.0m sq ft of new warehouse and industrial accommodation has been built or is under construction.
Access 18s 151,000 sq ft Unit 15 provides sought-after industrial and logistics space close to the M5 and near to Bristol Port, which was awarded authorised economic operator AEO status in October 2018.
We also own an adjoining 100 acres of land and ongoing development will reinforce Access 18s location as the strategic employment site in Avonmouth, with potential for an additional 800,000 sq ft of accommodation.
We have also built a new access road to link the site to Avonmouth Way and improved access to Avonmouth, the M5 and onwards to the South West and the M4.

Industrial and logistics assets now make up 33% of our portfolio.
We expect this to grow further as we accelerate our development activity, reinvesting the proceeds of our non-core disposals in our industrial and logistics pipeline, and retain most of the high-quality assets we develop.
This has the potential to deliver over 15m sq ft of space in the long term, of which almost 10m sq ft already has planning.
We continue to see good momentum.
Our committed pipeline currently stands at 1.5m sq ft, up from 1.0m sq ft a year ago.
We intend to retain 87% of this, with an expected ERV of 9.2m, compared with 5.1m in early 2018.

Demonstrating our commitment to building a high quality industrial and logistics business, the single 318,500 sq ft unit will include 27 dock doors, a 50m deep yard and two-storey office space, located in a key strategic location off the M42 motorway in Staffordshire.
Guy Gusterson, Property Director Midlands and North, said: O nce complete, the 35-acre Tamworth Logistics Park will become one of the largest warehouse developments in the Midlands, expected to create up to 1,700 jobs for the area.
The development of our largest speculatively-built unit showcases our confidence in the logistics market, with limited local competition of new stock and high occupier demand for units of this size.
Work began on the first phase of the development at the end of 2018, with three warehouse units ranging from 12,000 to 49,000 sq ft, due for completion in July 2019.
Construction work on the 318,000 sq ft unit will begin in Q1 2019 with it being ready for occupation in December 2019.
Our ability to unlock the potential of excellently-located industrial and logistics space has been proven through our delivery of just under 1.0m sq ft of projects in the year.
Good occupier demand has also seen us agree terms on 5.6m of development lettings since the start of 2018, representing 0.8m sq ft of space.
