Corporate Governance This report combines by reference the Corporate Governance Report on pages 35 to 38, which includes a statement on going concern.
Change of Control Part 6 of Schedule 7 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 requires the Company to identify those significant agreements to which the Company is party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid and the effects of any such agreements.
The Group has seven bank loan and mortgage facilities which contain change-of-control clauses.
Five of these facilities require the prior written consent of the lender to a change of control over the parent company, without which such change of control would constitute an event of default.
A change of control under the remaining two facilities would similarly constitute an event of default but no provision is made for the prior written consent of the lender.
At 31 March 2018, these Page 33 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REPORT continued facilities represented 112.5 million 2017 113.9 million of the loans and borrowings in the financial statements and undrawn facilities of 45.0 million 2017 48.4 million.
