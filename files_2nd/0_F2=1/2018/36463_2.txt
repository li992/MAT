Our strategic journey Becoming the customers favourite for food-on-the-go A lot has changed in the past five years Our transformation from bakery to food-on-the-go began in 2013, and the process of creating a centralised, fully-integrated business capable of supporting 2,500 shops is nearing completion, with just two years left to go.
Whilst this has required a once-in-a-generation level of capital investment and business change, it has already delivered results and helped our customers realise were so much more than sausage rolls!
The result a resilient brand, better able to cope with an unpredictable retail environment and economic uncertainty.
