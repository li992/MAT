Bonus awards will be based on achievement of the following measures: Weighting as Threshold On-target Stretch Super-stretch Measure Link to strategy % of award performance performance performance performance Corporate: Adjusted EPRA Earnings Reflects profitability of the 25% Budget Budget Budget Budget business after operating costs -5% 5% 10% Total accounting return Recognises the delivery of 25% Budget Budget Budget Budget significant added value -15% 15% 30% See-through loan-to-value Ensures continued balance 25% Budget Budget Budget Budget sheet strength -5% 5% 10% Personal: Individual targets for Ensures that each director 25% Substantially Met Exceeded Significantly executive directors focuses on his individual met exceeded contribution in the broadest sense through business performance, leadership role, people and team, and personal development objectives For the forthcoming year, adjusted EPRA earnings will be used as the profit-related measure in the annual bonus in place of trading profit that has been used in recent years.
The Committee has made this change to reflect the fact that adjusted EPRA earnings is now St. Modwens preferred profit measure used in all external reporting see page 110 and is the profit measure used to determine our dividend policy.
The Committee has set specific targets for all corporate measures, which reflect the Committees judgement of the ability of management to influence performance within the year.
Threshold performance will deliver 25% of the maximum opportunity, on-target performance 50% of the maximum, stretch 75% of the maximum and super stretch 100% of the maximum.
Stretch targets are demanding and will require a very substantial outperformance of budget to achieve maximum payout.
The threshold, target, stretch and super stretch performance requirements for financial objectives, together with outcomes, will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report for the year ending 30 November 2019.
This report will also include detailed commentary on the key deliverables, and assessment of outcomes, for personal objectives.
The proportion of the overall bonus that is awarded for personal performance will be capped at one-third of the total actual bonus awarded.
Any bonus awarded will be subject to the requirement to invest 40% of the net amount received in purchasing shares in the Company and to retain these shares for at least three years, irrespective of whether the executive director has met the shareholding requirement.

The Committee is satisfied that the targets are suitably stretching.
Performance against each target will be measured independently over the three financial years ending on 30 November 2021.

Performance below threshold would result in nil vesting for that measure.
In calculating TSR, a three-month average is used at both the start and the end of the performance period to ensure that the calculation is not impacted by potential volatility arising from day-to-day share price fluctuations.
The comparator group comprises the following companies: A&J Mucklow Group Grainger Land Securities Group Shaftesbury British Land Company Great Portland Estates LondonMetric Property St. Modwen Properties Capital & Counties Properties Hammerson Picton Property Income Town Centre Securities Capital & Regional Hansteen Holdings Regional REIT U and I Group Derwent London Helical SEGRO Workspace Group The 2018 19 awards will be subject to an underpin condition which the Committee must be satisfied has been met before permitting awards to vest, namely that the extent of vesting under the performance conditions is appropriate given the general financial performance of the Company over the three-year performance period.
The awards will also be subject to a compulsory two-year post-vesting holding period, which will require executive directors to hold any shares vesting after tax for a period of two years, meaning there can be no disposal of shares for a period of at least five years from grant.
The holding period will remain in place if the executive leaves employment during the two-year holding period.
