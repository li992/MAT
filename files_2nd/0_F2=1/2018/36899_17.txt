82 IMI plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Finance Directors Introduction Introduction from Daniel Shook Dear Shareholder, Welcome to the financial statements section of our Annual Report.
My financial review commentary is set out in this section alongside the primary statements.
These financial statements are presented with the primary statements first, followed by five sections: Basis of preparation, Results for the year, Operating assets and liabilities, Capital structure and financing costs and Other notes.
Despite mixed market conditions, IMI delivered solid results for the year, with revenue, profits and operating cash flow all growing in 2018.
The company has further mitigated the risks associated with the defined benefit pension schemes through the buy-out of 409m of liabilities during the year.
IMI continues to improve its overall control environment and risk management procedures in 2018 through the implementation of a co-sourcing model for internal audits between Group Assurance and the divisions.
In 2018 IMI completed the acquisition of Bimba Manufacturing Company, which is contributing in line with expectations.
