The Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited share prices used to calculate the estimated value of the awards vesting are the average share prices over the last quarter of 2018 which were 37.44 and A$77.04 respectively.
All executives who were granted the PSA in 2014 will also receive additional shares equal to the aggregate net dividends that would have been paid on the PSA shares that vest had they owned them during the five-year performance period.
No dividend payments will be made in respect of the shares that lapse.
T he estimated value of the LTIP awards for 2017 included in the 2017 Annual report was calculated based on an estimate of the vesting of the EBIT margin portion of the award of 91% resulting in a total estimated vesting of 63.7%.
The higher actual vesting of the EBIT margin portion of the award of 100%, based on a rank of no 2 against the comparator group of 11, resulted in a total actual vesting of 66.7%.
The impact of the higher vesting level was further increased by higher share prices at the time of vesting 40.72 and A$82.00 for the TSR portion, which vested on 19 February 2018, and 42.47 and A$82.75 for the EBIT margin portion which vested on 31 May 2018 compared with the average share prices over the last quarter of 2017 of 36.27 and A$71.11, which were used to calculate the estimated value.
Where applicable, the value of LTIP awards vesting includes the value of MSA granted prior to appointment as an executive.
