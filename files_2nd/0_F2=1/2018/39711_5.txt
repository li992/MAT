Savills plc Report and Accounts 2018 Market insights UK Commercial Investment turnover in the UK commercial property market in 2018 was 5.3% down on 2017.
However, the turnover of 62.1bn last year is still 1% above the five year average, and means that 2018 was the fourth strongest year since 2000.
43% of last years acquisitions were by non-domestic investors, with this proportion rising to 73% in the central London market.
The single most active source of capital was once again the Asia Pacific region, whose investors put 10.7bn into the UK market last year, much of which went to London.
2018 also saw a rise in domestic investor activity, both in the Core and Value-add segments of the market.
All of the three main commercial property sectors saw a year-on-year decline in investment activity, with the most significant fall being in the retail sector where activity fell 30%.
The only sectors that saw a year-on-year rise in 2018 were leisure and alternatives, which were up 9.7% and 8.7% respectively.
These sectors were boosted by a continuing demand for longer term secure income streams.
Occupational demand improved year on year in the office markets both inside and outside London, with take-up across the UK 0.4% up on 2017, reaching its second highest ever level of 22.7m sq.
ft. Take-up also remained strong in the logistics sector, with 34.7m sq.

08 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Spotlight on UK residential UK house buyers remained cautious in 2018, given uncertainty over the impact of Brexit upon future household finances.
Consequently mainstream house price growth remained weak, particularly in London and the South East.
By contrast, the Governments continued focus on increasing housing delivery, meant welcome support for an increasing range of players in the housing industry.
Among other things that included additional funding to unlock development sites, an extension of Help to Buy until 2023 and a series of strategic partnerships with various Housing Associations.
That resulted in an active, if increasingly price sensitive, development land market.
Conditions in the prime housing markets remained challenging, though there was a noticeable narrowing in relative price expectations of buyers and sellers over the course of the year.
Consequently transaction levels remained steady even though prices fell by -3.0% on average in the prime markets of London and by -0.9% beyond the capital.
Case Study Transaction Advisory Hexton Manor The Hexton Manor Estate is an exceptional residential, agricultural and sporting estate within the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and was sold by Savills in the autumn 2018, with a guide price of 19m.
09 Savills plc Report and Accounts 2018 Market insights continued US The US economy continued to expand at a robust pace, with real GDP rising by 2.9% in 2018 versus 2.2% in 2017.
Fiscal stimulus from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 underpinned growth in the corporate sector, with the labour market continuing to show positive momentum.
Consistent with the strength in hiring, office leasing volumes increased in 2017.
Particularly strong markets included Dallas Ft. Worth, New York, San Francisco and Washington D. C. each of which saw net absorption of Class A space in excess of 4 thousand square foot.
Nationally, growth in asking rents softened from 2017s pace, although markets including Atlanta and Charlotte each saw asking rents for Class A space rise by more than 5%.
Investment sales activity also increased, reversing a string of declining volumes in 2016 and 2017.
Activity was fuelled by strong cross-border investment.
Despite four increases in the central bank policy rate, yields on 10-year interest rates ended the year lower than they began, which supported broad-based gains in investment sales volume.
Sales activity in office, hotel and the multi-family sectors all increased, with notable strength in both the industrial and retail segments.
New York City continued to attract the bulk of investment, followed by Los Angeles and Dallas.
Case Study The first major law firm to relocate out of NW DC, Williams & Connolly moved into its current primary location at 725 12th Street in 1992.
The building sits on top of Metro Center and the business core of the city has filled in around it over the last three decades.
W&C is currently in two locations: 725 12th Street, NW and 1120 G Street, NW.
W&C leadership was open to considering non-traditional locations and not just consider fringe locations for negotiating leverage purposes.
The real estate committee reflected that the firm had been an East End pioneer in 1992 and, given its national practice as opposed to DC-centric it was willing to be pioneering again, provided the location addressed two priorities: Access to National Airport and the ability to consolidate their entire staff into one location.
In order for Williams & Connolly to consider the Wharf, the developer agreed to redesign the building from scratch around the firms ideal floorplate in order to maximize efficiency.
Getting comfortable with the location meant commissioning a complete and independent traffic study, comparing the Wharf with 725 12th Street and a more traditional NW relocation options, taking into account attorney and staff residences and various commuting methods.
In addition, a parking consultant was added to the team to devise a parking scheme that works for both the law firm and the mixed use, high traffic shared nature of the project garage.
New Space Highlights: Consolidation of entire firm into one building: dedicated parking nest within the project garage: exclusive use of entire tower with expansion rights in adjacent tower: exclusive lobby: penthouse multipurpose room with 360-degree views of Washington, DC that can accommodate the entire firm.

Annual office take-up across the 24 European markets that Savills monitor was in the region of 13m sq m, 3.3% down compared to 2017, but still 14% above the past six year average.
The most dynamic markets were Dublin 25% yoy, Lisbon 20.3% and Bucharest 12%, followed closely by Milan 11.8% and Barcelona 11.3%.
Employment creation and demand for well-designed and well-located offices have been driving the activity.
The average vacancy rate was at 5.7% in Q4 2018, down from 6.7% at the end of 2017.
Paris CBD 1.4% and Berlin 1.5% have almost no available office space, Munich follows with 2.4% vacancy rate and Cologne and Stockholm are also amongst five cities with the lowest availability at 3.9% and 4.0% respectively.
E-commerce is growing up at a faster pace than overall retail sales, hence becoming a major driver in the retail sector.
Over the past five years, the overall online retail sales increased by 21% pa on average.
At the same time overall retail sales increased by 2.5% pa on average.
Rising trade volumes and expanding e-commerce are driving demand for logistics space.
Globalised supply chains and rapidly changing retail patterns force logistics occupiers to adapt their property requirements in order to serve customers across different geographies and this explains why most development activity remains focused on build-tosuit logistics facilities.
The lack of suitable supply readily available on the market is putting upward pressure on rents.
Prime warehousing rents are on average 1.7% higher in Q4 2018 compared to 12 months ago.
The highest rises occurred in Brussels 9.1%, London M4 Heathrow 6.5% and Krakow 5%.
During 2018, European commercial investment transactions reached 241bn, as geopolitical concerns were brushed aside to leave volumes 3% above the five year average.
Resilient demand for offices 47% of total and the growth of the alternatives sector 21% fuelled investment volumes during 2018.
Industrial investment volumes reached 32bn last year, accounting for 14% of the total investment volume.
This was the second highest level of investment on record, after 2017.

However, the average amount raised in final closings by private closed ended funds rose from $533m in 2017 to $711m.
The fall in number of closed ended private funds is the sixth straight year of declines, from a high of 339 funds closing in 2013.
However, this fall in number of closed funds is not matched by a fall in private equity dry powder, with Preqin reporting that there is $295bn dry powder available versus $249bn 12 months prior.
45% of funds closed above target, the largest proportion recorded by Preqin in five years.
There are 674 real estate funds currently in the market seeking a total of $250bn, up from 12 months ago.
22% of the sector-specific funds that closed in 2018 were focused on industrial, and these funds accounted for 43% of capital raised for sector-specific funds.

Case Study SIM McArthurGlen Designer Outlet, France Investors increasingly seek the ability to invest in real estate in different ways, including through direct and indirect means as well as through funds or purpose-built vehicles.
The off-market acquisition of two French McArthurGlen designer outlet centres in Troyes and Roubaix for a price approaching c. 300m exemplified this trend.
The properties were acquired on behalf of a club of investors managed by a leading German Multi Manager, and were additionally funded with commitments from existing Savills IM funds.
The assets were acquired from real estate funds managed by Ares Management Corporation and McArthurGlen and the deal was a testament to the strength and breadth of Savills IMs operational platform.
It necessitated the creation of co-investment acquisition structures in the form of a new Spezialfonds and OPPCI under challenging timescales, as well the placement of significant debt and ongoing fund management through teams across the UK, France and Germany.
The manner of the structuring and acquisition also afforded the two in-house vehicles the ability to gain exposure to significant assets that would otherwise have been out of reach.

Hong Kongs stellar performance was once again due to inflows of PRC funds which were most marked in the first half of the year.
Of the major real estate asset classes, the industrial market had a red-letter year in 2018 with volumes up by 15% year-on-year and yields hardening to new lows.
Demand for offices and prime retail malls held up well despite the challenges which began to weigh more heavily in the second half of the year.
In contrast to the region overall, China recorded its slowest year since 2014 as headwinds gained strength.
A highly leveraged corporate sector facing tighter credit regulation, slower economic growth and trade tensions with the US all contributed to more muted activity levels.
Japan also posted a disappointing year with volumes hit by record pricing and a pull back in domestic interest.
Generally, even active Asia-Pacific investment markets ended the year on a subdued note as rising interest rates, trade tensions and volatile stock markets challenged historically high valuations and record low commercial cap rates.
