These compare with a total return of 12.6% from the Companys benchmark index, the TOPIX Index, in sterling terms.
Over the last three and five years the Company has returned 89.1% and 107.3% respectively versus 66.6% and 78.2% for the benchmark, also all in sterling, with a share price return of 83.9% and 103.4% over three and five years.
The average level of gearing over the 12 month period was around 15%, which enhanced returns in a rising market.
Nicholas Weindling Investment Manager Investment Philosophy and Process Our investment approach emphasizes individual stock selection to build a portfolio of quality growth stocks with strong future growth prospects.
This means that, within some broad portfolio risk limits, the Companys portfolio is likely to differ materially from the benchmark index as we will avoid companies and sectors that face structural issues even if they are a large constituent of the benchmark index.
The opportunity to find attractive opportunities is assisted by the fact that the Japanese market is under-researched when compared with other developed equity markets.
With well over 50% of the constituents of the Companys benchmark index being covered by no more than one provider of broker research, there are significant opportunities to uncover hidden sources of return from Japanese equities.
Against the background of a market with poor sell-side coverage, we have the resources in Japan to carry Shoichi Mizusawa Investment Manager out our own research and identify attractive investment themes and companies.
Our Tokyo-based investment team consists of 24 investment professionals who have carried out over 2,000 company visits in We have the the past year.
resources in A combination of desk-based research and company meetings contribute to our rating of a company.
We consider the growth opportunity for the industry overall before considering the companys competitive Japan to carry positioning and management.
This allows us to assess the companys potential for growth.
We then look at out our own financial metrics with a focus on cash flow and balance sheet strength to assess the overall economics of research and the business.
We also consider governance issues such as shareholder returns, management strength and the track record on environmental and social issues.
Only then do we consider valuations we do not buy identify a company where the short term valuation looks low unless it has a strong long term growth outlook.
attractive This work carried out in looking through the under-researched parts of the market helps us build portfolios investment that are comprised of a number of high conviction holdings which we expect to hold for long periods of time.
themes and Several points evidence this philosophy.
The portfolio has long had a bias towards mid cap and small cap companies stocks.
At the year end the portfolio held 61 different stocks, down from 70 over the period.
And 16 of the stocks in the portfolio have been held continuously for more than three years.
qxp 12 11 2018 15:21 Page 10 I N V E S T M E N T M A N A G E R S R E P O R T Portfolio Themes In building the Companys investment portfolio we have identified several key themes that underlie much of our stock selection.
We believe these themes are long term resilient sources of return for Japanese companies and have been in place for over 5 years.
The extent to which an individual company that we research is a beneficiary of one or more of these themes adds to the attractions of the company.
Below we explain these themes, give the weighting of each theme in the portfolio and give examples of companies that exhibit them.
Internet Japan is a very advanced country in some areas but, perhaps surprisingly, it lags in others.
A prime example is e-commerce where the penetration of online shopping is lower than in many developed nations.
Similarly, the 31% percentage of on-line advertising is still relatively low compared to many other markets.

In 2012 1 8.4 million tourists visited Japan.
By the end of 2017 this number had increased to c. 28.7 million.
The number 19% of visitors in 2018 looks set to increase c. 15% to around 33 million.
This trend is driven by a relaxation in visa restrictions, the weaker yen making Japan a more affordable destination and rising wages across Asia leading to a growing middle class who want to travel more.
We believe that growth in tourism to Japan is a long term structural trend.
Shiseido Whereas Asian tourists visiting Europe often purchase luxury goods, other types of products are also popular in Kao Corp Japan including skin cream, medicines, cosmetics and baby goods.
These products are perceived as high Daikin Industries quality, safe and reliable.

As a result we have witnessed steady increases in both dividends and share buybacks, a rise in the number of outside directors that sit on company boards and increasing numbers of companies officially stating return on equity and or return on asset targets.

Today there are over 125 million people living in Japan but by 2050 this will fall by around 20%: older people will make up an increasingly large percentage of the total population.
This 6% may be bad news for many companies with a domestic bias as demand for their products will drop in the long term.
It is, however, good news for a small number of companies which presents an opportunity for active managers to focus on those companies that will benefit from a strong following in future years.
Nihon M&A Center Highlighted Company: Nihon M&A Center Relo Group We have held Nihon M&A Center since July 2012 and it continues to be a significant stock in the portfolio.
Obic Corporate consolidation is the reason.

qxp 12 11 2018 15:21 Page 14 I N V E S T M E N T M A N A G E R S R E P O R T Investment Performance The themes to which the portfolio is exposed have not changed during the year under review.
The financial characteristics of the portfolio are also unchanged: balance sheets and free cash flows are stronger: earnings growth faster and return on equity higher than the market as a whole.
For example, as at 30th September 2018 the holdings in the portfolio generated an average return on equity of 15.8%, compared to the benchmark return on equity of 11.8%.
The portfolio valuation, as measured by the price earnings ratio, is higher than the market average but we believe the strong long-term growth prospects of the companies we own more than justify this.
We also have a bias to mid and smaller sized companies reflecting the fact that coverage by analysts is poor.
This provides us with the opportunity to identify investments overlooked by the broader market.
These companies also tend to have more focused business models.
Investors should expect to see these characteristics in the portfolio over the economic cycle.
The top Over the year under review, we made some changes to the portfolio, reducing the number of holdings from contributing seventy to sixty one.
We also increased the gearing level from 13.6% to 14.7%.

It is growing sales, with revenues growing in excess of 20% a year, and rapidly winning new customers: and Recruit a recruitment company.
It operates several websites including the company Indeed, the worlds largest employment website.
Recruit is expected to benefit from the tight labour market and take market share from existing employment agencies.
The largest negative contributors to performance were Mercari, Suruga Bank, Komatsu, Square Enix and Nexon.
Except for Suruga Bank, which had a compliance failure and we have sold, we have continued belief in the long term investment cases for these stocks and therefore remain holders of these positions.
At the end of September 2018, the largest overweight positions compared to the TOPIX were in Recruit, Keyence, M3, Shiseido and CyberAgent.
Investment outlook We continue to The Japanese market is more cyclical than other developed markets and can be impacted by global see robust economic developments, both positively and negatively.

In addition, Chinese macro data is weaker than recent years and negotiations for a new trade deal between the United States and Japan are at an early stage.
