WICKER MAN ROLLER COASTER AT ALTON TOWERS The process to create the Wicker Man started more than four years ago as Alton Towers looked to create a new family thrill ride.
The Merlin Magic Making MMM creative team took on the challenge to create an innovative theme that was exciting enough for thrill-seekers and also one that most of the family can enjoy, and from there came the idea of putting wood and fire together.
MMM then project managed the construction as the Wicker Man took shape 7,500 tonnes of sustainably sourced wood creating over 2,000 feet of track to give riders the unique woodie experience.
In its first year of operation the Wicker Man has been really well received, winning industry awards, delivering on its investment criteria and helping drive significant revenue growth and high customer satisfaction levels.
