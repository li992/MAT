ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2018 29 The demand for new power and thetransformation of governance indeveloping markets In emerging markets, rapid electrification and expanding demand result in significant need for investment across all types ofgeneration, providing interesting opportunities for power generation players.
Especially in Africa and Eastern Europe, there are few international operators actively pursuing opportunities and we expect to grow in these regions given ourstrong operational presence, track record and ability to creatively structure our projects both financially and contractually.
In these markets we willcontinue using Political Risk Insurance PRI to protect ourinvestment.
The changing relative value of different generation assets creates new opportunities for flexible investors The value of generation assets varies overtime depending on numerous factors including size, geography, technology andthe differing strategies of potential investors.
Opportunities constantly evolve and the areas with the best risk-adjusted returns in the future are likely to be different from today.
This gives advantage to investors, such as ContourGlobal, with the flexibility to invest opportunistically across markets and technologies.
Ourdisciplined investment framework allows for internal competition for capital and theability to deliver high value growth byremaining selective, inavery active greenfield and M&A environment.
Markets periodically suffer micro-cyclicality The generation sector in some jurisdictions can be micro-cyclical driven by economic fluctuations, availability of domestic capital and financing capital markets volatility.
Thefluctuations can create a downward orupward pressure on returns.
We remain flexible around geographies, associated presence in and knowledge of high growth markets, and creativity on structuring projects which create above-market returns whencyclicality pressures returnupwards.
