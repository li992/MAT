Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 45 Measuring our financial performance Providing clarity on the Groups alternative performance measures Following the issuance of the Guidelines onAlternative Performance Measures APMs by the European Securities and Markets Authorities ESMA in June 2015, the Group has included thissection in its Annual Report and Accounts with the aim ofproviding transparency and clarity on the measures adopted internally to assess performance.
Throughout this report, the Group has presented financial performance measures which are considered most relevant to Balfour Beatty andare used to manage the Groups performance.
These measures are chosen to provide a balanced view of the Groups operations andare considered useful to investors as thesemeasures provide relevant information on the Groups past or future performance, position or cash flows.
The APMs adopted by the Group are also commonly used in the sectors it operates in and therefore serve as a useful aid for investors to compare Balfour Beattys performance to its peers.
The Board believes that disclosing these performance measures enhances investors ability to evaluate and assess the underlying financial performance of the Groups continuing operations and the related key business drivers.
These financial performance measures are also aligned to measures used internally to assess business performance in the Groups budgetingprocess and when determining compensation.
Equivalent information cannot be presented by using financial measures defined in the financial reporting framework alone.
Readers of the Annual Report and Accounts are encouraged to review the financial statements in their entirety.
Performance measures used to assess the Groups operations in the year Underlying profit from operations PFO Underlying PFO is presented before finance costs and interest income and is the key measure used to assess the Groups performance in the Construction Services and Support Services segments.
This is also a common measure used by the Groups peers operating in these sectors.
This measure reflects the returns to the Group from services provided in these operations that are generated from activities that are not financing in nature and therefore an underlying pre-finance cost measure is more suited to assessing underlying performance.
Underlying profit before tax PBT The Group assesses performance in its Infrastructure Investments segment using an underlying PBT measure.
This differs from the underlying PFO measure used to measure the Groups Construction Services and Support Services segments because in addition to margins generated from operations, there are returns to the Investments business which are generated from the financing element of its projects.
These returns take the form of subordinated debt interest receivable and interest receivable on PPP financial assets which areincluded in theGroups income statement in investment income.
These are then offset by the finance cost incurred on the non-recourse debt associated with the underlying projects, which is included in the Groups income statement in finance costs.
Measuring the Groups performance The following measures are referred to in thisAnnual Report and Accounts when reporting performance, both in absolute terms and also incomparison to earlier years: Statutory measures Statutory measures are derived from the Groups reported financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with International FinancialReporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
Where a standard allows certain interpretations to be adopted, the Group has applied its accounting policies consistently.
These accounting policies can be found on pages 120 to 127.
The Groups statutory measures take intoaccount all of the factors, including thosethat it cannot influence principally foreign currency fluctuations and also large non-recurring items which do not reflect the ongoing underlying performance of the Group.
Performance measures In assessing its performance, the Group has adopted certain non-statutory measures because, unlike its statutory measures, these cannot bederived directly from its financial statements.
com AR2018 46 Measuring our financial performance continued Providing clarity on the Groups alternative performance measures continued The Group commonly uses the following measures to assess its performance: a Order book The Groups disclosure of its order book is aimed to provide insight into its pipeline of work and future performance.
The Groups order book is not a measure of past performance and therefore cannot be derived from its financial statements.
The Groups order book comprises the unexecuted element of orders on contracts that have been secured.
Where contracts are subject to variations, only secured contract variations are included in the reported order book.
Where contracts fall under framework agreements, an estimate is made of orders to be secured under that framework agreement.
This is based on historical trends from similar framework agreements delivered in the past and the estimate of orders included in the order book is that which is probable to be secured.
In accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Group isrequired to disclose the remaining transaction price allocated to performance obligations not yet delivered.
This is similar to the Groups order book disclosure, however it differs for the following reasons: the Groups order book includes its share of orders that are reported within its joint ventures and associates.
In line with section e, the Board believes that including orders that are within the pipeline of its joint ventures and associates better reflects the size of the business and the volume of work to be carried out in the future.
This differs from the statutory measure of transaction price to be allocated to remaining performance obligations which is only inclusive of secured revenue from the Groups subsidiaries.
as stated above, for contracts that fall under framework agreements, the Group includes in its order book an estimate of what the orders under these agreements will be worth.
Under IFRS 15, each instruction under theframework agreement is viewed as aseparate performance obligation and is included in the statutory measure of the remaining transaction price when received but estimates for future instructions are not.
the Groups order book does not include revenue to be earned in its Infrastructure Investments segment as the value of this part of the business is driven by the Directors valuation of the Investments portfolio.

These items include: gains and losses on the disposal of businesses and investments, unless this is part of a programme of releasing value from the disposal ofsimilar businesses or investments such as infrastructure concessions costs of major restructuring and reorganisation of existing businesses acquisition and similar costs related to business combinations such as transaction costs impairment and amortisation charges on intangible assets arising on business combinations amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
These are non-underlying costs as they do not relate to the underlying performance of the Group.
From time to time, it may be appropriate to disclose further items as non-underlying items in order to reflect the underlying performance of the Group.
The results of Rail Germany have been treated as non-underlying items as the Group is committed to exiting this part of the business.
Further details of these non-underlying items are provided in Note 10.
A reconciliation has been provided below to show how the Groups statutory results are adjusted to exclude non-underlying items and their impact on its statutory financial information, both as a whole and in respect of specific line items.

The table belowreconciles this to the statutory earnings per share.

As the Group uses revenue as a measure of the level of activity performed by the Group during the year, the Board believes that including revenue that is earned from its JVAs better reflects the size of the business and the volume of work carried out and more appropriately compares to PFO.
This differs from the statutory measure of revenue which presents Group revenue fromits subsidiaries.
A reconciliation of the statutory measure ofrevenue to the Groups performance measure is shown in the tables in section b.
A comparison of the growth rates in statutory and performance revenue can be found in section i. f Recourse net cash borrowings The Group also measures its performance based on its net cash borrowings position atthe period end.
This is analysed using onlyelements that are recourse to the Group and excludes the liability component of the Companys preference shares, which is debtin nature according to statutory measures, asthis is excluded from the definition of net debt in the covenants setoutin the Groups facilities.
Non-recourse elements are cash and debtthat are ringfenced within certain infrastructure concession project companies.

The Group calculates its average net cash borrowings based on the average opening and closing figures for each month through the period.
The average net cash borrowings measure excludes non-recourse cash and debt and the liability component of the Companys preference shares, and this performance measure shows average net cash of 194 million for 2018 2017: 42 million.
Using a statutory measure, which is derived using the average opening and closing figures for the year, inclusive of non-recourse elements and the liability component of the Companys preference shares, gives average net borrowings of 76 million for 2018 2017: 117 million.
h Directors valuation of the Investmentsportfolio The Group uses a different methodology to assess the value of its Investments portfolio.
As described on pages 27 to 29, the Directors valuation has been undertaken using forecast cash flows for each project based on progress to date and market expectations of future performance.
These cash flows have been discounted using different discount rates depending on project risk and maturity, reflecting secondary market transaction experience.
As such, the Board believes that this measure better reflects the potential returns to the Group from this portfolio.
The Directors have valued the Investments portfolio at 1.15 billion at year end 2017: 1.24 billion.
The Directors valuation will differ from the statutory carrying value of these investments, which are accounted for using the relevant standards in accordance with IFRS rather than a discounted cash flow approach.

com AR2018 50 Measuring our financial performance continued Providing clarity on the Groups alternative performance measures continued Comparison of the statutory measure of the Investments portfolio to its performance measure 2018 2017 m m Statutory measure of the Investments portfolio as above 613 592 Difference arising from the Directors valuation being measured on a discounted cash flow basis compared tothestatutory measure primarily derived using a combination of the following IFRS bases: historical cost amortised cost fair value 538 652 Directors valuation performance measure 1,151 1,244 2017 valuation includes 62 million relating to the 7.5% partial disposal of the Connect Plus M25 asset, as the disposal proceeds had not been received at year end.
The proceeds were received on 23 February 2018.
The difference between the statutory measure and the Directors valuation performance measure of the Groups Investments portfolio is not equal to the gain on disposal that would result if the portfolio was fully disposed at the Directors valuation.
This is because the gain loss on disposal would be affected by the recycling of items which were previously recognised directly within reserves, which are material and can alter the resulting gain loss on disposal.
The statutory measure and the Directors valuation are fundamentally different due to the different methodologies used to derive the valuation of these assets within the Investments portfolio.
As referred to in the Strategic Report on page 27, the Directors valuation is calculated using discounted cash flows.
In deriving these cash flows, assumptions have been made and different discount rates used which are updated at each valuation date.
Unlike the Directors valuation, the assets measured under statutory measures using the appropriate IFRS accounting standards are valued using a combination of the following methods: historical cost amortised cost fair value for certain assets and liabilities within the PPP portfolio, for which some assumptions are set at inception and some are updated ateach reporting period.
There is also an element of the Directors valuation that is not represented by an asset in the Groups balance sheet.
This relates to the management services contracts within the Investments business that are valued in the Directors valuation based on the future income stream expected from these contracts.
i Constant exchange rates CER The Group operates across a variety of geographic locations and in its statutory results, the results of its overseas entities are translated into the Groups presentational currency at average rates of exchange for the period.
The Groups key exchange rates applied in deriving itsstatutory results are shown in Note 3.
To measure changes in the Groups performance compared with the previous period without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Group provides growth rates on a CER basis.
These measures remove the effects of currency movements by retranslating the prior periods figures at the current periods exchange rates, using average rates for revenue and closing rates for order book.
