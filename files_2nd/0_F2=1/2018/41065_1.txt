Strategic report The investment objective of Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc WPCT or the Company is to achieve long-term capital growth through investing in a diversified portfolio with a focus on UK companies, both quoted and unquoted.
As these companies evolve, the geographical profile of the portfolio may change to become more global in nature for reasons such as an overseas listing or as the result of changes to capital value of a non-UK company.
The Company will aim to deliver a return in excess of 10 per cent per annum over the longer term.
This is a target only, not a profit forecast, and there can be no assurance that it will be met.
