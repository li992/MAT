With its contemporary design, the complex will be energy efficient and will incorporate innovative technologies.
Providing an ecologically clean environment with greenery and varied recreational zones, the Tbilisi Business Centre proposes a transition from a traditional closed and introverted working model, towards a flexible, open and more comfortable working environment.
The design of the new head office was inspired by the traditional Georgian Shatili towers, where the terraced layout and large balconies of the architectural structures harmoniously merge with the landscape.
The design of the new head office is by the international architecture firm, UNStudio, founded by Ben van Berkel.
The opening of the complex is scheduled to take place within three years.
We are building a completely new type of complex that has no equivalent in Georgia.
While working on the concept for the new head office we incorporated TBC Banks strategy, vision and core values.
The project will also serve as a catalyst for the development of a new area of the city, promoting socio-economic development through the creation of a financial knowledge centre and an innovation platform commented Frans van Vuure, Director and Senior Architect at UNStudio.
