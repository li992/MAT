Market review Group Introduction Meggitts core civil aerospace, defence and energy markets share a common requirement for smart engineering for Market Revenue extreme environments.
These mission MABS 18% MCS 28% MPC 19% and safety critical components and MSS 24% MEG 11% sub-systems must perform to exacting requirements for many years in highly demanding operating conditions.
Suppliers must be capable of meeting rigorous certification requirements.
The environments in which many of our products operate result in high levels of wear and tear and demand for spares and repairs.
This drives aftermarket revenues for decades after initial product delivery.
