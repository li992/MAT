BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Strategic Report 41 Capital structure Following the review of our capital structure, we announced in March 2018 that we had increased our target leverage range based on the strong and robust cash flow fundamentals of the Group.
The Group manages net debt in the range of 2.5x to 3.0x underlying adjusted EBITDA which we believe gives flexibility and headroom for the investment requirements of the Group and the cyclicality within the B&GA market, our primary market.
The Group has performed within this target range during 2018 with net debt to underlying adjusted EBITDA at 31 December 2018 being 2.8x on a covenant basis, in line with expectations.
The new target range provides up to 1.0x headroom against the Groups net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA banking covenant.
Interest rate risk management The interest rate exposure arising from the Groups borrowing and deposit activity is managed by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy with respect to interest rate risk management is tofix portions of debt for varying periods based upon the debt maturity profile and an assessment of interest rate trends.
At the end of 2018, approximately 44% 2017: 55% of the Groups total borrowings were fixed at weighted average interest rates of 4.2% 2017: 3.5% for a weighted average period of five years 2017: threeyears.
Currency risk management The Groups policy is to hedge all significant transactional currency exposures through the use of forward currency contracts.
The Groups policy is to draw its borrowings principally in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets, which areprincipally denominated in US dollars.
