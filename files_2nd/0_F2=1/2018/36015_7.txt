Key performance indicators 1 Focused and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses We measure contract retention as a percentage of First Student and First Transit contract retention existing business subject to bid in the year rather % than as a percentage of the contract portfolio as a whole.
In First Student and First Transit we typically expect retention of around 90%.
In First Student, our 83% contract retention rate during the summer 2017 bid season was slightly lower than we had hoped for but the 5.3% average price increase was in line with our bidding strategy.
In First Transit, our contract retention rate was 82% during the year, principally reflecting the two shuttle contracts in the Canadian oil sands region that were 83% 82% not renewed in the year.

In First Rail, like-for-like passenger revenue growth was 4.1%, within which the equivalent figure for TPE was 10.0%, in GWR was 2.7%, while in our open access operation Hull Trains it was 3.3%.
