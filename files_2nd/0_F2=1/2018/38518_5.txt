2014 90.0 How measured: Gross profit from each type of placement expressed as a percentage of total Ratio of permanent vs gross profit.
temporary placements Why its important: This ratio reflects both the current stage of the economic cycle and our geographic spread, as a number of countries culturally have minimal temporary placements.
Gross profit 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 It gives a guide as to the operational gearing potential in the business, which is significantly Permanent 76 76 76 75 76 greater for permanent recruitment.
Temporary 24 24 24 25 24 How we performed in 2018: The ratio increased slightly to 76:24 2017: 75:25, with strong growth in markets where we have a higher ratio of permanent recruitment such as Asia and Latin America.
17 | Strategic Report FINANCIAL Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Key Performance Indicators How measured: Number of fee earners and directors involved in revenue-generating Fee earner activities at the year end, expressed as the percentage change compared to the prior year.
headcount growth % Why its important: Growth in fee earners is a guide to our confidence in the business and macro-economic outlook, as it reflects expectations as to the level of future demand above 2018 11.3 the existing capacity within the business.
2017 16.7 How we performed in 2018: Fee earner headcount grew by 619, or 11.3% in the year, 2016 5.1 resulting in 6,116 fee earners at the end of the year, a record for the Group.

Strategic Report | 18 PEOPLE STRATEGIC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Key Performance Indicators How measured: Direct and Indirect GHG emissions calculated in line with the UK Governments Total GHG emissions 2018 DEFRA reporting standards.
Principally based on data from a sample of our offices, covering 68% of the Group by headcount, and extrapolated for the Group as a whole.
Total energy-derived emissions Why its important: The emissions calculations look at the CO e impact of our operations in CO e tonnes 2 2 absolute terms.
Source of emissions 2017 2018 How we performed in 2018: Direct GHG emissions relating to the combustion of fuel decreased Direct GHG emissions 1,966 1,882 by 4.3% to 1,882 tonnes CO e, while Indirect GHG emissions, through the purchase of energy such Indirect GHG emissions 4,872 5,379 2 as electricity, increased by 10.4% to 5,379 tonnes.
How measured: Intensity values for GHG emissions are based on property and vehicle energyIntensity values of derived emissions per 1,000 headcount.
Headcount is viewed as being the most representative metric for PageGroups activity levels and is unaffected by issues such as business mix or foreign GHG emissions exchange variations.
CO e tonnes per 1,000 employees Why its important: Intensity values help to normalise the GHG metrics and place them in the 2 2017 2018 context of the Groups changing business profile, particularly in terms of increases in headcount.
Energy-derived emissions 1,013 920 It helps to identify where progress has been made on emission reduction.
How we performed in 2018: Energy-derived emissions were reduced by 9.2% compared with 2017, largely due to an increase in headcount without a corresponding increase in the number of offices, along with changes in fuel sources and improvements in office energy efficiencies Relevant strategic objective: Sustainable growth.
2017 Direct and Indirect GHG emissions were originally reported as 1,627 and 4,948 respectively.
These have been restated to reflect the latest DEFRA fuel conversion rates in 2018.
The 2017 Intensity value of energyderived emissions has been restated from 974 to 1,013 on the same basis.
The source of data and calculation methods year-on-year are on a consistent basis.
The movements in KPIs are in line with expectations.
Emissions derived from property amounted to around 74% of total emissions.
