19 November 2018 STRATEGY IN ACTION Hickorys This year Ei Commercial Properties further strengthened its relationship with barbecue restaurant chain Hickorys Smokehouse.
The deal involved a major investment of over 1 million in the former Pageant pub in Southport and saw it converted to become one of nine restaurants in their portfolio, which also includes another Ei Commercial Properties site in Rhos-on-Sea.
With the aim of maximising value using our commercial property expertise and partnering with high-quality operators we were able to secure a new commercial lease with a tenant prepared to invest significantly in the asset to deliver the right proposition for the benefit of the local community.
We are proactively working with the team at Hickorys to identify other potential sites across our estate for future projects.
Hickorys Chief Executive Neil McDonnell said We are absolutely delighted to have reached agreement with Ei Commercial Properties on this site.
It was originally marketed as a tied tenancy but they were flexible in their discussions, which enabled us to agree a different approach and make a significant investment into this site for the benefit of our customers.
The new site has had a very positive response from the local community in the early days of trading.
