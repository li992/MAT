Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 CUSTOMER AT OUR LISTENING HEART TO WHAT CUSTOMERS WANT.
Customer at our Heart is the cornerstone of our strategy for profitable growth.
Our desire to create agenuinely customer-centric organisation shapes the way in which we think about the culture of our business, the values by which wework and the services we provide to everyone who holidays with us.
Itcontinues to act as apowerful catalyst for change andwe believe it is where we have the biggest opportunity todifferentiate ourselves from the competition.
We know that happy customers are more likely to comeback to Thomas Cook and to recommend us to theirfriends.
As customer loyalty increases, our cost of sale goes down as customers choose ThomasCook because of our reputation rather than our marketing.
We also know that on average customers that return toThomasCookspend more with us than new customers, reflectingtheir increased trust in our holiday offering.
We see the tangible value our customer focus creates across the business, shown most clearly in how customers are willing to paymore for a hotel following improvements in its quality performance: generating better returns for the business.
Operationally, we focus our Customer at our Heart strategy in two areas: the care and reassurance we provide to our customers, set out in our three CustomerPromises of Quality, Service and Reliability: andthe contact we maintain with customers, ensuringthat we are accessible however they choose tointeract with us and forming long-lasting  the year.
