com Financial review continued Capital structure Capital structure Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Capital is primarily required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators PRA, Lloyds, Central Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors.
Beazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union EU Solvency II regime SII.
We comply with all relevant SII requirements.
Further capital requirements come from rating agencies who provide ratings for Beazley Insurance Company, Inc and Beazley Insurance dac.
We aim to manage our capital levels to obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred client base.
Beazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements.
The amount of surplus capital held is considered on an ongoing basis in light of the current regulatory framework, opportunities for organic or acquisitive growth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital structure.
Our preferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However, there may be times in the cycle when the group will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
At such points in time the board will consider returning capital to shareholders.
On issuance of the new tier 2 subordinated debt in 2016, Beazley Insurance dac was assigned an Insurer Financial Strength IFS rating of A by Fitch.
In 2018, Beazley acquired 6.0m of its own shares into the employee benefit trust.
These were acquired at an average price of 547p and the cost to the group was 32.8m.
The following table sets out the groups sources of funds: 2018 2017 $m $m Shareholders funds 1,466.9 1,498.9 Tier 2 subordinated debt 2026 248.7 248.5 Retail bond 2019 95.6 99.5 Long term subordinated debt 2034 18.0 1,811.2 1,864.9 Our funding comes from a mixture of our own equity alongside $248.7m of tier 2 subordinated debt, a $95.6m retail bond and an undrawn banking facility of $225.0m.
The changes in the US tax legislation announced towards the end of 2017 have led us to reconsider how risk is distributed across the group and following changes to Beazleys internal reinsurance programs, more premium and more risk is retained within the US in our admitted insurance company, BICI.
As a result of this, BICI has required a c. $80m increase in its capital, which was partially offset by a decrease in the Lloyds ECR.
The net impact on the groups capital requirement was not material.
These changes do not impact how Beazley manages its operations.
We expect that Beazleys revised internal reinsurance arrangements may still result in some exposure to the new US BEAT tax, but that it will not have any significant impact on the groups effective tax rate.
The final Lloyds economic capital requirement ECR at year end 2018 as confirmed by Lloyds is consistent with our projection at the interim results and reflects our plans for growth.
Overall we expect our capital requirement to grow in line with the net written premiums in our business plan, which in the short term should be high single digit.
The following table sets out the groups capital requirement: 2018 2017 $m $m Lloyds economic capital requirement ECR 1,594.5 1,517.2 Capital for US insurance company 173.4 96.5 1,767.9 1,613.7 At 31 December 2018, we have surplus capital of 26% of ECR on a Solvency II basis.
Following payment of the second interim dividend of 7.8p, this surplus reduces to 23% compared to our current target range of 15% to 25% of ECR.
Solvency II The Solvency II regime came into force on 1 January 2016.
Beazley continue to provide quarterly Solvency II pillar 3 reporting to both Lloyds for the Beazley managed syndicates and the Central Bank of Ireland for Beazley Insurance dac and Beazley plc.
During 2018 the second annual solvency financial condition report SFCR of Beazley plc was published.
Under Solvency II requirements, the group is required to produce a Solvency Capital Requirement SCR which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews the syndicates SCRs to ensure that SCRs are consistent across the market.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 49 The current SCR has been established using our Solvency II approved internal model approved by Central Bank of Ireland CBI which has been run within the regime as prescribed by Lloyds.
In order to perform the capital assessment: we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and the internal model process is embedded so that teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
IFRS 17 The implementation of IFRS 17: Insurance contracts is currently scheduled for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2021, although a 12 month deferral is widely expected.
Applying this standard is a major undertaking and so the company has established a multi-disciplinary project group to oversee this activity.
The project has made good progress during 2018 and Beazleys preparations for IFRS 17 are on schedule.
