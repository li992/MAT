John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 OUR INTERNATIONAL REACH John Laing has a well-established presence in each of its core overseas markets: Asia Pacific, North America and Europe, including the UK.
When selecting target regions, we look for an identifiable pipeline of projects coming to market, a trusted legal system, returns that meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates, strong political will to utilise private investment and the existence of a market for operational investments or a strong expectation that one will develop.
It is also a precondition that we are able to develop partnerships with strong contractors and ones that have an established local presence.
For the first time, our pipeline includes a small number of opportunities in Latin America.
