Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2018 222 Financial key performance indicators The following tables and narrative provide further analysis of the financial key performance indicators which are described in the financial review of the annual report on p44-50, are shown within the key performance indicators on p2 of the annual report and shown in notes 2 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Adjusted performance measures The annual report and accounts reports results and performance on a headline basis which compares the reported results both on a statutory and on a non-GAAP non-statutory basis.
The Groups adjusted performance measures are non-GAAP non-statutory financial measures and are also included in the annual report as they are key financial measures used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources to business segments.
The measures also enable investors to more easily, and consistently, track the underlying operational performance of the Group and its business segments by separating out those items of income and expenditure relating to acquisition and disposal transactions, major restructuring programmes and certain other items that are also not representative of underlying performance.
The Groups definition of adjusted performance measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
A reconciliation of the adjusted measures to their corresponding statutory measures is shown below.
Sales Underlying sales movements exclude the effect of exchange, the impact of portfolio changes arising from acquisitions and disposals and the impact of adopting new accounting standards that are not retrospectively applied.
Portfolio changes are calculated by taking account of the additional contribution at constant exchange rates from acquisitions made in both the current year and the prior year.
For acquisitions made in the prior year the additional contribution is calculated as the sales made in the period of the current year that corresponds to the pre-acquisition period in the prior year.
Sales made by businesses disposed in either the current year or the prior year are also excluded.
Constant exchange rates are calculated by assuming the average exchange rates in the prior year prevailed throughout the current year.
These non-GAAP measures enable management and investors to track more easily, and consistently, the underlying sales performance of the Group.

Further details are given below under Adjusted earnings per share.
Underlying adjusted operating profit movements exclude the effect of exchange, the impact of portfolio changes arising from acquisitions and disposals and the impact of adopting new accounting standards that are not retrospectively applied.
For acquisitions made in the prior year the additional contribution is calculated as the operating profit made in the period of the current year that corresponds to the pre-acquisition period in the prior year.
Operating profit made by businesses disposed in either the current year or the prior year is also excluded.
This non-GAAP measure enables management and investors to track more easily, and consistently, the underlying operating profit performance of the Group.

Adjusted earnings is included as a non-GAAP measure as it is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources to business segments and by investors to more easily, and consistently, track the underlying operational performance of the Group over time.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated as adjusted earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue on an undiluted basis.
The following items are excluded from adjusted earnings: Cost of major restructuring In May 2017, the Group announced a restructuring programme to run between 2017 and 2019 to drive significant cost savings.
The costs of this restructuring programme are significant enough to exclude from the adjusted operating profit measure so as to better highlight the underlying performance see note 4.
Other net gains and losses These represent profits and losses on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other financial assets and are excluded from adjusted earnings as they distort the performance of the Group as reported on a statutory basis.
Intangible charges These represent charges in respect of intangible assets acquired through business combinations and the direct costs of acquiring those businesses.
These charges are excluded as they reflect past acquisition activity and do not necessarily reflect the current year performance of the Group.
Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2018 224 Financial key performance indicators Other net finance income costs These include finance costs in respect of retirement benefits, finance costs of deferred consideration and foreign exchange and other gains and losses.
Finance income relating to retirement benefits are excluded as management does not believe that the consolidated income statement presentation under IAS 19 reflects the economic substance of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Finance costs relating to acquisition transactions are excluded as these relate to future earn outs or acquisition expenses and are not part of the underlying financing.
Foreign exchange and other gains and losses are excluded as they represent short-term fluctuations in market value and are subject to significant volatility.
Other gains and losses may not be realised in due course as it is normally the intention to hold the related instruments to maturity.
UK pension GMP equalisation In 2018 the impact of adjustments arising from clarification of guaranteed minimum pension GMP equalisation legislation in the UK, as outlined in note 25 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, has also been excluded as this relates to historical circumstances.
Impact of US tax reform In 2017, as a result of US tax reform, the Groups share of profit from associates was adversely impacted by 8m.
This amount has been excluded from adjusted earnings as it is considered to be a transition adjustment that is not expected to recur in the near future.
Tax Tax on the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
Where relevant the Group also excludes the benefit from recognising previously unrecognised pre-acquisition and capital losses.
The tax benefit from tax deductible goodwill and intangibles is added to the adjusted income tax charge as this benefit more accurately aligns the adjusted tax charge with the expected rate of cash tax payments.

ROIC is calculated as adjusted operating profit less operating cash tax paid expressed as a percentage of average invested capital.
Invested capital includes the original unamortised goodwill and intangibles.
Average values for total invested capital are calculated as the average monthly balance for the year.
ROIC is also presented on a net basis after removing impaired goodwill from the invested capital balance.
The net approach assumes that goodwill which has been impaired is treated consistently to goodwill disposed as it is no longer being used to generate returns.
