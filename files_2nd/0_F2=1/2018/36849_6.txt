Delivery against Group financial targets Return on tangible equity Return on tangible equity % Our target is to achieve a reported return on tangible equity RoTE 2018 8.6 of more than 11% by the end of 2020.
We intend to do this while 2017 6.8 maintaining a common equity tier 1 CET1 ratio of greater than 14%.
2016 2.6 RoTE is calculated as reported profit attributable to ordinary shareholders less changes in goodwill and the present value of in-force long-term insurance business, divided by average tangible shareholders equity.
A targeted reported RoTE of 11% in 2020 is broadly equivalent to a reported return on equity RoE of 10%.
In 2018, we achieved a RoTE of 8.6% compared with 6.8% in 2017.
Adjusted jaws Adjusted jaws measures the difference between the rates of change Adjusted revenue up in adjusted revenue and adjusted operating expenses.
Our target is to maintain positive adjusted jaws on an annual basis, Adjusted jaws 4.4% while noting the sensitivity of the impact on adjusted jaws of unexpected movements in revenue or operating expenses growth.
Adjusted operating expenses up 1.2 % Positive jaws occurs when the figure for the percentage change in revenue is higher than, or less negative than, the corresponding rate for operating expenses.
5.6% In 2018, adjusted revenue increased by 4.4% and our adjusted operating expenses increased by 5.6%.
Adjusted jaws was therefore negative 1.2%.
Total dividends declared in respect of the year Dividends $bn We plan to sustain the annual dividend in respect of the year at its 2018 10.2 current level for the foreseeable future.
Growing our dividend will 2017 10.2 depend on the overall profitability of the Group, delivering further 2016 10.1 release of less efficiently deployed capital and meeting regulatory capital requirements in a timely manner.
To achieve these financial targets by 2020, we aim to deliver mid-single-digit growth in revenue, lowto mid-single-digit growth in operating expenses, and approximately 12% annual growth in RWAs.
Given the current economic environment, we will seek to offset some or all of any possible weaker-than-planned revenue growth with actions to manage operating expenses and investments.
