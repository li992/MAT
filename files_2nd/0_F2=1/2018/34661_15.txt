Exploration and development is systematically focused on the Upper Cleopatra zone, collating increasing detailed geological information, progressing decline development and establishing drill platforms.
Cleopatra exploration completed 2,260 metres of decline development, extracting 185,333 tonnes of mineralised development ore at an average grade of 1.74g t. A total of 20,392 metres were drilled from two drill sites in Upper Cleopatra, 1120mRL and 1150mRL levels, targeting the northern extension of the Porphyry-Keel Ptah Deeps.

Sukari Gold Mine: measured open pit resources lie in areas where drilling is available at a nominal 25 x 25 metre spacing, indicated resources occur in areas drilled at approximately 25 x 50 metre spacing and inferred resources exist in areas of broader spaced drilling: the resource estimate extends over a strike length of 2.6 kilometres and to a maximum depth of 0 meters in elevation a maximum depth of approximately 1000 metres below wadi level : all available surface drilling and channel samples were used as at 22 August 2018, but underground production holes were excluded.
The resource data set comprised 326,021 two-metre down hole composites and surface rock chip samples: and mineral resource estimates were adjusted to the mining surface and underground mining voids as at end of June 2018, and planned underground mining voids were excised to avoid double counting of underground resources.
Doropo and ABC indicated resources occur in areas drilled at approximately 50 x 50 metre spacing and inferred resources exist in areas of broader spaced drilling.
The reported Doropo estimates are limited to blocks with a maximum depth of 250 metres below surface and within 80 metres of drill hole data.
All available Doropo data was used as at 6 December 2018.
The reported ABC estimates are limited to blocks with a maximum depth of 250 metres below surface and within 100 metres of drill hole data.
All available ABC data was used as at 10 December 2018.
The Doropo and ABC resource data set includes RC and diamond drill data and gold estimates are based on 50g Fire Assays completed at Bureau Veritas Mineral Laboratories, Abidjan.
