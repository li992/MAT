During this time, Stephen led over 400 million of investments, including the acquisition of stakes in Kelda Group Yorkshire Water, Zephyr wind farms and Meter Fit gas electricity metering.
He also sat on the boards of these companies after acquisition.
Prior to this, he was a director at Financial Security Assurance, where he led over 2 billion of underwritings in the infrastructure and utility sectors.
He also worked for the investment companies of the Serco and Kvaerner Groups.
Laurence also has 22 years of investment management and nancing experience.

GAV is the sum of: DCF valuations of the Groups investments: cash at Group and wind farm SPV level : and other relevant assets and liabilities of the Group.
The DCF valuation of the Groups investments represents the largest component of GAV and the key sensitivities are considered to be the discount rate used in the DCF valuation and assumptions in relation to ination, energy yield, power price and asset life.
As there is no debt at wind farm level, the DCF valuation is produced by discounting the individual wind farm cashows on an unlevered basis.
The equivalent levered discount rate would be approximately 2 per cent.
higher than the blended portfolio discount rate.
For the year end DCF valuation, we have applied an upgraded discounting methodology.
Previously, each wind farms cashows were discounted at a single discount rate, irrespective of their nature.
We now apply different discount rates, tailored to the nature of the underlying cashows: for example, one discount rate for xed ROC cashows and a higher discount rate for merchant power cashows.
The blended portfolio discount rate, assuming a 25 year asset life see below, remains unchanged from 31 December 2017 at 7.7 per cent..
In addition to but separate from the upgraded discounting methodology, we have increased the asset life assumption used in the year end DCF valuation from 25 to 30 years, following a third party technical assessment of the portfolio.
The technical asset life for many wind farms signicantly exceeds 30 years and we have made appropriate assumptions in relation to the continued good management of the assets, lease extensions and other factors.
We consider that the 30 year asset life assumption is a more appropriate assumption to be used to determine the fair value of the portfolio.
Amending the asset life and associated assumptions increased NAV per share by 6.7 pence.
It also means that the blended portfolio discount rate has increased from 7.7 per cent.
as a result of including a higher proportion of higher discount rate merchant power cashows in years 26-30.
is considered to be a reasonable range of alternative assumptions for discount rate.
The base case long term RPI assumption is 3.0 per cent.
above the long term 2.0 per cent.
The assumption was increased from 2.75 per cent.
Base case energy yield assumptions are P50 50 per cent.
probability of exceedance forecasts produced by expert consultants based on long term wind data and operational history.
probability of exceedance over a 10 year period and P10 10 per cent.
probability of exceedance over a 10 year period sensitivities reect the future variability of wind and the uncertainty associated with the long term data source being representative of the long term mean.
Given their basis on long term operating data, it is not anticipated that base case energy yield assumptions will be adjusted other than any wind energy true-ups with compensating purchase price adjustments.
Long term power price forecasts are provided by a leading market consultant, updated quarterly and may be adjusted by the Investment Manager where more conservative assumptions are considered appropriate.
Base case real power prices increase from approximately 48 MWh 2020 to approximately 58 MWh 2040.
The sensitivity below assumes a 10 per cent.

20 GREENCOAT U K W I N D Investment Managers Report continued NAV Sensitivities continued The following chart shows the impact of the key sensitivities on NAV: Impact on NAV Discount rate - 0.5% Inflation rate - 0.5% Energy yield 10 year P90 P10 Power price - 10% Asset life - 5 years -20p -15p -10p -5p 0p 5p 10p 15p 20p pence per share Outlook There are currently 21GW of operating UK wind farms 13GW onshore plus 8GW offshore.
Installed capacity is set to grow to 14GW onshore plus 12GW offshore by 2021.
In monetary terms, the secondary market for operating UK wind farms is approximately 50 billion, increasing to 75 billion by 2021.
The Group currently has a market share of approximately 4 per cent..
The average age of the portfolio is 5.7 years versus 5 years at listing in March 2013.
In the year, the Group entered into agreements to acquire Tom nan Clach, its first CFD wind farm and Douglas West, its first subsidy free wind farm.
While it is anticipated that the majority of the Groups future investments will continue to be ROC wind farms, CFD and subsidy free wind farms provide diversied further pipeline opportunities.
At all times, the Group will maintain a balanced portfolio, in line with the Companys investment objective.
The key value driver affecting operating UK wind farms is the wholesale power price.
In general, independent forecasters expect the UK wholesale power price to rise in real terms, driven by higher gas and carbon prices.
The long term power price forecast is updated each quarter and reected in the reported NAV.
The Company does not expect any material change to its business as a result of the UK exiting the European Union.
Being solely UK focused and deliberately low risk, all of the Groups assets and liabilities are within the UK and sterling denominated.
In addition, the regulatory regime under which the assets operate is robust, longstanding and rooted in UK legislation.
In general, the outlook for the Group is very encouraging, with proven operational and financial performance from the existing portfolio combined with a healthy pipeline of attractive further investment opportunities.
