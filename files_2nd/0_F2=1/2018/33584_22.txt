STRATEGIC REPORT COAL COAL Our coal portfolio is geographically diverse, with metallurgical coal assets in Australia, and thermal coal assets in South Africa and Colombia, which mine products attuned to the individual requirements of our diversified customer base.
We are the worlds third largest exporter of metallurgical coal.
HIGHLIGHTS STRATEGIC FOCUS Prioritising safe production through a focus on the elimination of fatalities programme across Australia 11% and South Africa increase in underlying EBITDA Innovation-led productivity growth from Metallurgical Tyler Mitchelson Coals underground longwall operations, which produce CEO benchmark quality hard coking coal.
This includes the Metallurgical Coal Moranbah-Grosvenor plant debottlenecking project $3.2 billion Refocus the Coal South Africa business to primarily underlying EBITDA produce export coal and deliver on productivity targets Develop a responsible growth pathway to value for the significant metallurgical coal endowments in the portfolio, including Peace River Coal in Canada and Moranbah 67% South in Australia.

Anglo American plc Integrated Annual Report 2018 67 STRATEGIC REPORT COAL Solid demand from South Korea and Japan underpinned the prices for higher energy coals in the Pacific region.
Various supply issues in Australia also affected the availability of these higher energy coals.
Chinese import demand decreased in the second half of the year as domestic stocks were rebuilt and a rebound in supply from Indonesia and SouthAfrica increased the discounts for lower energymaterial.
For more information, refer to the Marketplace review section See pages 14-15 OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE Metallurgical Coal Total production increased by 11% to 21.8 Mt, largely driven by higher production from the underground longwall operations which increased by 15% to 14.2 Mt 2017: 12.3 Mt.
The increase was driven by sustained strong performance at Moranbah, which improved on its previous record and produced 6.8 Mt: and Grosvenor, which increased output to 3.8 Mt.
Grasstrees production decreased by 25% to 3.6 Mt, marginally above planned volumes, as the operation moved into more challenging areas of the mine as it nears its end of life and undertook anadditional longwall move in the year.
Thermal Coal South Africa Export production decreased by 1% to 18.4 Mt 2017: 18.6 Mt as operations continued to transition between mining areas.
Total production from the Export mines increased by 12% to 24.6 Mt 2017: 22.0 Mt, drivenby productivity-led growth from the underground operations.
Total output benefited as market prices allowed the processing of mineral residue deposits MRD, which generates earnings and avoids capital expenditure for the MRD expansions, as well as helping to mitigate future rehabilitation costs.
MRD production can be soldeither into the domestic or export markets.
Thermal Coal Colombia Anglo Americans attributable production from its 33.3%ownership of Cerrejn decreased by 4% to 10.2 Mt 2017:10.6 Mt.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK Metallurgical coal Full year 2019 production guidance for metallurgical coal is 22-24 Mt.
Export thermal coal Full year 2019 production guidance for export thermal coal is 26-28 Mt.
