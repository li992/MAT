We are required to disclose emissions from biologically sequestered carbon, which includes emissions released through the combustion of biomass to generate electricity.
The biogenic CO2 emissions resulting from power generation are counted as zero in official reporting to both UK authorities and under the EU ETS as the use of sustainable biomass is considered to be CO2 neutral at the point of combustion.
This methodology originates from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The majority of our emissions result from the process of using solid fuel.
This can make it difficult to identify other smaller trends that are still significant.
To counteract this dominance and to ensure we retain a balance between highlighting significant developments and providing meaningful data, we have adopted a materiality threshold of 100,000 tonnes of CO2e.
Drax Groups total Scope 1 carbon Our Scope 2 carbon emissions increased, We have reported our global and UK emissions decreased by 33.4% between due to Pellet Production moving into our Total Energy Consumption for 2018, in 2017 and 2018.

Biomass can play an important role in providing markets for thinnings and low grade roundwood where few alternative uses exist.
It also offers a market for material that has been damaged by natural disturbances, such as wind, fire, pests and diseases, and by-products of forest stands managed for the production of solid wood products, such as construction saw-timber and furniture.
We are committed to sourcing biomass that contributes to the long-term maintenance of growing stock and productivity and that helps to improve the health and quality of forests at a local and regional level.
We monitor forest inventory data and local industry trends, in addition to certification and our auditing process, to determine whether biomass demand is having a positive impact on regional forest industries.
This allows us to make informed sourcing decisions.
