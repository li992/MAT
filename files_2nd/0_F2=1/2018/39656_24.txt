Governance Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations Saga is committed to creating an inclusive working environment and to rewarding our employees throughout the organisation in a fair manner.
In making decisions on executive pay, the Remuneration Committee considers wider workforce remuneration and conditions.
We believe that employees throughout the Company should be able to share in the success of the Company.
To this end we have a Share Incentive Plan in place that employees can contribute to annually or monthly.
We also issue free shares to employees on an annual basis as part of our overall approach to reward and recognition.
We also believe that employees should have the opportunity to save for their future and to this end we recently carried out a full review of our pension arrangements following which we retained an open defined benefit scheme, though restructured to ensure affordability, and significantly enhanced defined contribution arrangements.
We also introduced a monthly savings product to enable our employees to save through payroll.
As part of our commitment to fairness, we have introduced this section which sets out more information on our wider workforce pay conditions, our Group CEO to employee pay ratio, our gender pay statistics, and our diversity policy.
Whilst we recognise there is much work still to do, we believe that transparency is an important first step towards making improvements in relation to these important issues.

As part of its evolving remit the Remuneration Committee will in the future review all remuneration policies across the Group.
While the Company does not currently directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating the Remuneration Policy, the Company does receive an update and feedback from the broader employee population on an annual basis using an engagement survey which includes a number of questions relating to remuneration.
The Group aims to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is market competitive and operates the same core structure as for the Executive Directors.
The Group operates employee share and variable pay plans, with pension provisions for all Executive Directors and employees.
In addition, any salary increases for Executive Directors are expected to be generally in line with those for UK-based employees.
Communication with employees The Groups employees are kept informed of its activities and performance through a series of Director-led staff briefings at key points during the year and the circulation of corporate announcements and other relevant information to staff which is supplemented by updates on the intranet.
These briefings also serve as an informal forum for employees to ask questions about the Company.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 100 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Share schemes Share schemes are a long-established and successful part of our total reward package, encouraging and supporting employee share ownership.
In particular, all employees are invited to participate in the Companys SIP.
Equal opportunities The Company is committed to an active equal opportunities policy from recruitment and selection, through training and development, performance reviews and promotion.
All decisions relating to employment practices are objective, free from bias and based solely upon work criteria and individual merit.
The Company is responsive to the needs of its employees, customers and the community at large.
We are an organisation which uses everyones talents and abilities, where diversity is valued.
The Company remains supportive of the employment and advancement of disabled persons and ensures its promotion and recruitment practices are fair and objective.
The Company encourages the continuous development and training of its employees and the provision of equal opportunities for the training and career development of all employees.
Retirement benefit provision The Group provides retirement benefits for the majority of its employees.
The Groups commitment with regard to pension contributions, is to provide employees with an option to either contribute to a defined benefit pension scheme after three years of employment, or to benefit from a defined contribution scheme with matched contributions up to a maximum of 10% of base salary dependent upon service.
The defined contribution scheme is open to all employees in accordance with the new Government auto enrolment rules.
The defined benefit scheme is open to new members after three years of service.
Individuals in the defined benefit scheme can also flex up their contributions through a better accrual scheme that is age dependent.
Pay comparisons CEO Ratio Our Group CEO to average employee pay ratio for 2017 18 is 34:1.
This is measured as the ratio of CEO single figure pay realised in the year to average mean employee pay.
To give context to this ratio, we have set out below a chart tracking the CEO to average employee pay ratio since 2014 15 alongside Sagas TSR performance since IPO.
Our Group CEO to average Executive Committee pay ratio for 2017 18 is 2:1.
This is measured as the ratio of CEO single figure pay realised in the year to average mean Executive Committee pay.
To give context to this ratio, we have set out a table on page 102 tracking CEO pay and average Executive Committee pay over time.
The TSR graph shows the value of 100 invested in the Companys shares since listing compared with the FTSE 250 index.
The graph shows the TSR generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of dividend income.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this since listing.
This graph has been calculated in accordance with the regulations.
It should be noted that the Company listed on 23 May 2014 and therefore only has a listed share price for the period from 23 May 2014 to 31 January 2018.

The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration payable in its earlier years as a private company to the Executive Chairman does not bear comparative value to that which has been and will be paid to the Group Chief Executive Officer, and has therefore chosen only to disclose remuneration for the Group Chief Executive Officer: Group Chief Executive Officer 2017 18 2016 17 2015 16 2014 15 1 2 Total single figure 1,058,869 2,490,617 1,600,287 5,328,702 Annual bonus payment level achieved percentage of maximum opportunity 0% 67.5% 78.6% 80.7% LTIP vesting level achieved 3 percentage of maximum opportunity 26.0% 65.6% n a n a Ratio of single total remuneration figure 4 shown to employees as a whole to employee mean 34:1 78:1 56:1 190:1 to employee median 48:1 95:1 78:1 258:1 Ratio of single total remuneration figure shown to Executive Committee members to member mean 2:1 4:1 2:1 3:1 to member median 3:1 4:1 2:1 3:1 Notes: 1 F or 2016 17 the final value of the 2014 LTIP award as at vesting date is shown which has been restated from the 2016 17 annual report.
The share price at vesting date of 30 06 2017 was 209.4p 2 The Group Chief Executive Officer joined the Company on 24 March 2014.
The remuneration shown is therefore not for the full financial year.
Included within the single figure is a cash award of 4m with vesting based on continued employment.
25% immediately on the IPO, 25% on the first anniversary of the award and 50% on the second anniversary: this was part of the buyout on the recruitment of the Group Chief Executive Officer to compensate for awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his former employer 3 Based on indicative vesting as at 31 January 2018.
The award will vest on 29 June 2018.
The final vesting outcome will be stated in the 2018 19 annual report 4 The fall in this ratio in 2017 18 is due to the forfeiture of bonus by the CEO and the relatively low payout on the LTIP.
This reflects the fact that shareholders want Executive Directors to have a higher proportion of pay at risk and this is reflected in the volatility in the chart on page 101.
The percentage change in CEO remuneration set out in the table below shows that year on year when the volatility of payouts from equity based awards is excluded that the changes in remuneration for the CEO and average employee are broadly in line.
This demonstrates that the underlying compensation ratio is not increasing year on year There was no long-term incentive plan or share option plan operated prior to listing.
Percentage change in Group CEO remuneration The following table sets out the change in the remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive Officer from 2016 17 to 2017 18 compared to the average percentage change for employees.
The Group Chief Executive Officers remuneration disclosed in the table below has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits excluding pension, and annual bonus including any amount deferred.
The employee pay has been calculated using the following elements: annual salary base salary and standard monthly allowances: taxable benefits car allowance and private medical insurance premiums: and annual bonus Company bonus, management bonus, commission and incentive payments.

At Saga, we are passionate about equality, diversity and inclusion and are committed to addressing our gender pay gap.
We therefore welcome the new legislation and have embraced this as an opportunity to drive our focus on diversity forward.
Definitions Difference between gender pay and equal pay: A gender pay gap is the difference between average male and female pay across an organisation, regardless of nature of work.
This means that gender distribution across grades will be a significant driver of any gap.
An equal pay gap, on the other hand, refers to an unlawful pay gap between male and female employees carrying out the same roles with the same experience and skills.
The gender pay gap is a metric that measures the difference in average hourly pay across all men and women across an organisation, by reference to both the mean and median figures.
The mean is an arithmetic average of a set of numbers.
The mean calculation considers basic average pay bonus across all of our employees.
The median is the number in the middle of a set of ordered numbers.
The median calculation focuses on those employees in the middle of pay bonus ranges, thereby reducing the impact of our highest and lowest paid employees.
The median calculation reduces the very significant impact of our most senior male employees, in order to provide a gender pay gap figure which is much more representative of the majority of our employees.
Gender distribution across salary quartiles Sagas demographic i. e. the gender makeup of our employee population across the grades has a significant impact on our gender pay and bonus gaps.
The charts below show the gender makeup of the Saga Group workforce in each of our four salary quartiles.
If we lined up every employee from the lowest paid to the highest paid and split them into four equal sized groups this gives us our salary quartiles.
Lower quartile Upper middle quartile 38.9% 61.1% 40.6% 59.4% Lower middle quartile Upper quartile 46.0% 54.0% 56.5% 43.5% Overall, 56.4% of our employees across the Group are female as at April 2017.
The quartiles above show that we have proportionally more women at the lower end of the pay spectrum, and more men at the upper end.
This gender imbalance is a key driver of our gender pay and bonus gaps shown below, and is something that we are working hard to address through our focus on the development and progression of talented individuals of all genders and backgrounds.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 103 Governance Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations continued Saga Group gender pay gaps This chart shows our mean and median hourly pay gaps, based on April 2017 payroll data.
5.7% 5.7% 15.0% 15.0% Mean hourly Median hourly pay gap pay gap 20.7% 5.7% Demographic factors Non-demographic factors As shown above, our median hourly pay is much lower than the mean gaps.
This is easily explained, as the median calculation reduces the significant impact of our most senior male employees in order to provide a gender pay gap figure which is much more representative of the majority of our employees.
We wanted to fully understand the impact of Sagas gender demographic on our pay gaps, so we carried out further analysis which showed that around three quarters of our overall gap was due to demographic factors, i. e. having more male employees in senior roles.
When looking at the gap amongst employees at similar levels, the gap significantly reduced to 5.7%.
This is the same as our median gap, which reinforces the fact that our most senior male employees have a major impact on our figures.
It is purely coincidental that our non-demographic percentage is the same as our median hourly pay gap.
Our 5.7% median hourly pay gap is lower than the national average median pay gap of 18.4% across all sectors, as well as the national averages for the financial and insurance activities sector 31% and the retail trade sector 17%.
However, we want to equalise gender representation across our grades and thereby reduce our gaps further, so will continue to proactively review and address pay and diversity on an ongoing basis.
Based on Office for National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2017 Based on PwCs Women In Work Index 2018 Saga Group gender bonus gaps This chart shows our mean and median bonus gaps, based on data from April 2016 to March 2017.
As required by law, we have included annual bonus, commission and equity payments in these calculations.
9.4% 54.2% Mean Median bonus gap bonus gap 63.6% 22.5% Demographic factors Non-demographic factors While men and women are offered the same opportunities to receive bonuses, our bonus gaps are larger than our pay gaps.
This is expected for a number of reasons and can be explained.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 104 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Demographic gaps in both pay and bonus are caused by an overrepresentation of male employees in our senior roles, which has the impact of increasing the average male salary across Saga and therefore driving the overall pay gaps.
The majority of our bonus rates, and share awards are also linked to a percentage of salary, and so our bonus gap is further increased by the presence of more men in the higher-paying upper quartiles.
The buyout award made on IPO to the Group CEO as part of his recruitment to compensate for awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his previous employer had a significant impact on our overall mean bonus gap because part of the deferred portion was paid during this gender pay reporting period.
In order to understand this gap further, we completed additional analysis on our bonus gap.
As you can see from the chart on page 104 the vast majority of our mean bonus gap 63.6% was caused by our gender imbalance, for the reasons outlined above.
Our non-demographic gap is something that we will review in more detail.
However, this could be attributed to a number of factors that are not part of the calculation, for example performance, experience or our broad grading structure.
We are proud to support and promote flexible working at Saga and as a result a large number of our employees work part-time.
However, as we are required to use actual bonus amounts in our calculations rather than full-time equivalent amounts, this was a key contributor to our 22.5% median bonus gap figure, particularly as the majority of our employees who work part-time are female.
Proportion of employees receiving a bonus Across all Saga Group employees, 68.3% of men and 75.9% of women received a bonus in the 12 months prior to April 2017.
This difference is due to a number of factors, such as the inclusion of commission payments in the calculation and the fact that we have a higher proportion of female employees in those roles which are able to earn commission.
Given the nature of both our bonus and commission schemes being linked directly to performance this will also contribute to the percentage of entitled employees receiving a bonus.
What we are doing to close the gap We are passionate about providing a fair and transparent workplace which welcomes and celebrates difference.
We are a diverse organisation and want to ensure that our workforce and employment practices reflect this.
We are committed to continually developing and improving our gender pay position.
Our demographic analysis has shown that the key driver of our gaps is a lack of female representation in our most senior roles.
This is therefore a crucial area of focus for us, and one which we are confident that the initiatives below will help to tackle: Review of our grading structure and introduction of published salary banding for all roles across Saga.
The promotion of flexible working opportunities and part-time roles across all roles at Saga regardless of seniority.
The provision of on-site childcare for head office employees.
Targeted development programmes for high performers of all backgrounds, including mentorships, executive shadowing, internal and external training.
Diversity policy Creating a thriving and diverse workforce is a high priority for our business.
A diverse workforce means we are attracting the best people and that the business is benefiting from broad experience and a range of different backgrounds and skill sets.
Saga employs enthusiastic, committed and well-trained people.
We recognise the benefits of diversity of skills, knowledge and independence, as well as gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation and are fully committed to an active equal opportunities policy covering recruitment and selection, training and development, performance reviews and promotion.

Comparative figures for the 2016 17 financial year have also been provided.
Figures provided have been calculated in accordance with the UK disclosure requirements: the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 Schedule 8 to the Regulations.
As per regulations, the value of the award was calculated based on quarterly average share price up to the reporting date.
The three month average share price to 31 01 2018 was 146.8p.
The performance period of the TSR element of the award is due to be tested in June 2018.
The value in the table above assumes zero vesting under the TSR element based on performance to year end.

Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 107 Governance Annual Report on Remuneration continued The formulaic outcome under the bonus would have resulted in a bonus pay out of 47.4% and 39.5% of salary for the Group CEO and Group CFO respectively.
The Executive Directors felt that, looking in a holistic way at the performance of the business and the experience of shareholders over the year, it would be appropriate to waive their 2017 bonuses.
The Committee accepted the offer of the Executive Directors given its view that the formulaic outcome from the bonus did not entirely reflect both the underlying performance of the business over the period and the impact on near term profitability.
See the Remuneration Committee Chairs Annual Statement on pages 8387 for further information.
Long-term incentives vested in 2017 18 audited The LTIP awards granted on 30 June 2014 vested on 30 June 2017.
The final vesting percentage was 65.6%, compared to 50.0% estimated in the 2016 17 annual report.
This increase represents the improvement in the relative TSR performance between 31 January 2017 and 30 June 2017.
The TSR element resulted in Sagas ranking giving a TSR vesting of 31.2%.
The table confirms the vesting of the 2014 LTIP award for Lance Batchelor and Andrew Goodsell, who was awarded the LTIP as Executive Chairman in 2014 prior to his change in role to Non-Executive Chairman.
The final vesting percentage of 21.9% for Andrew Goodsell reflects the pro rating of his award up to the date he ceased to be an Executive Director on 30 June 2015.

No discretion has been exercised by the Committee in determining the level of LTIP vesting.
Long-term incentives vesting in respect of 2017 18 performance audited The LTIP awards granted on 30 June 2015 have not yet vested but as performance was substantially completed during the 2017 18 financial year, an estimate of the vesting and the indicative value of the awards has been provided below.
This figure will be updated in the 2018 19 Annual Report on Remuneration to reflect the final vesting outcome and the actual share price on the date of vesting currently, in line with the regulations, the average share price for the last quarter of the financial year has been used.
The 2015 LTIP is equally weighted between EPS and relative TSR performance conditions.
The EPS growth is measured to the 2017 18 year end and the three year TSR condition concluding on 29 June 2018.
The EPS over the period has grown by 8.8% p. a. against the range of 7-12% p. a. equating to a vesting of 52.0% of the EPS element.
