This is why, in March 2018, we launched our first digital-only bank in Cte dIvoire.
Cte dIvoire has led the way in the adoption of digital financial transactions in West Africa This is a reection of its ongoing economic transformation.
Mobile money account usage stands at 34 per cent of all adults among the highest in West Africa demonstrating that the population is opting to use mobile money accounts as opposed to traditional financial institutions.
As part of our offering in Cte dIvoire, we have digitised over 70 of the most popular banking services, including account openings.
Customers can open a new account entirely through our app anytime, anywhere from the comfort of their own home or while on the road.
We expect Cte dIvoire bank account take-up led by digital to rise rapidly over the next five years, with the country poised to act as a digital banking catalyst for the wider region, just as Kenya sparked East Africas mobile money revolution a decade ago.
