Property portfolio review Challenging investment markets drive mixed valuation performance Investment markets Investment markets for the Groups property sectors have slowed through 2018, with buyers reluctant to invest, reflecting a challenging occupational market and macro-economic uncertainty, particularly in the UK.
In the UK shopping centres, transaction volumes totalled 1.3 billion in 2018, approximately a third lower than 2017 Source: Property Data.
In addition to the Groups sale of a 50% interest in Highcross, key transactions included British Lands acquisition of Royal Victoria Place, Tunbridge Wells and the sale of Shop Stop, Clapham Junction to DTZ Investors.
UK retail yields moved out by 50-75 basis points during the year and now range from 4.85% to 6.25% for prime and super prime centres.
In France, shopping centre transactions were also limited with a total volume of 0.4 billion in 2018 2017: 1.0 billion Source: C&W.
Prime assets remain in demand but are in relatively short supply, whilst there is a widening gap between prime and secondary assets.
Yields have stabilised at a record low level of 3.5% for prime shopping centres.
The transaction volume in Ireland for 2018 is estimated at 0.1 billion, lower than recent years which have seen a number of large transactions.
Yields remained stable throughout the year and this is expected to continue into 2019.
Overseas investors accounted for approximately 65% of acquisitions across all sectors.
UK retail parks transactions in 2018 totalled 1.9 billion 2017: 2.7 billion Source: C&W.
Institutional investors remain the most active buyers, favouring smaller lot sizes of less than 30 million.
Yields moved out by 25-75 basis points during the year, with peripheral locations the worst affected.
The European outlets sector saw fewer transactions in 2018, with total investment volumes of 0.5 billion in 2018 2017: 1.1 billion Source: C&W.
Whilst there have been no sales at the top end of the market, strong demand remains for these premium outlets.
Overall, investment yields have remained stable, with those for the best European outlets ranging from 4.5%-5.5%.
Portfolio valuation At 31 December 2018, the Groups total portfolio, including premium outlets, was valued at 9,938 million, a reduction of 622 million or 5.9% during 2018.

The investment portfolio in France included capital expenditure on projects at SQY Ouest, Les Terrasses du Port, Italie Deux and Les 3 Fontaines.
4 million of costs in relation to the Italik project at Italie Deux, Paris were classified as space accretive.
UK retail parks incurred 13 million, with the remaining expenditure at the Elliotts Field Shopping Park development which completed in 2017 classified as creating additional space.
Expenditure recorded as not creating additional area principally related to the completion of reconfiguration works at Ravenhead Retail Park in St. Helens following the relocation of M&S from the town centre.
Within the Developments and UK other portfolios, capital expenditure of 99 million was incurred of which 84 million was on the Groups development properties, principally on the extensions at Les 3 Fontaines and the Orchard Centre in Didcot.
In the analysis above, costs incurred working up future development projects at Brent Cross and Croydon are classified as creating no additional area as work has not started on site.
Further details of these projects are included in the Operating review on page 31.
Capital expenditure within the premium outlets portfolio totalled 39 million, of which 25 million was incurred by Value Retail and 14 million by VIA Outlets, principally on reconfigurations and extensions.
Disposals Disposals reduced the portfolio by 616 million during 2018.
The key transactions were: The sale of the residual stake of Saint Sbastian, Nancy completed in January 2018 for 10 million, the majority of the property having previously been sold in December 2017 for 129 million In February, we sold Battery Retail Park in Birmingham for proceeds of 57 million and Wrekin Retail Park in Telford for 35 million In July, we sold Jeu fide Paume, a small shopping centre in Beauvais developed by the Group, for 19 million.
Following opening in November 2015, it traded poorly with weak tenant sales and leasing demand, and the disposal is in line with our strategy of focusing only on flagship retaildestinations In October, we completed the sale of Fife Retail Park, Kirkcaldy and Imperial Retail Park, Bristol for total proceeds of 164 million In November, we completed the sale of a 50% interest in Highcross Shopping Centre to an Asian investor introduced by M&G Real Estate for 236 million.
The sale price represented a 5.5% net initial yield and a 5% discount to the December 2017 value In addition to exiting the UK retail parks sector, we will continue with our capital recycling strategy and are targeting disposal proceeds in excess of 500 million from across our portfolio in 2019 to support the Groups debt reduction priority.

In the UK, flagships suffered a deficit of 347 million principally due to outward yield shift averaging 37 basis points across the portfolio.
Whilst the lack of shopping centre transactions provides limited evidence of this movement, it reflects the change in wider market sentiment during the year.
The underlying value of the French portfolio decreased by 14 million.
Revaluation deficits at OParinor and Espace Saint Quentin were partially offset by uplifts on Les 3 Fontaines, Italie Deux and Les Terrasses du Port.
The Irish assets achieved a revaluation gain of 9 million, principally due to income growth at Pavilions, Swords and Dundrum Town Centre.
UK retail parks suffered a revaluation deficit of 126 million, also derived predominantly from outward yield shift.
The impact of CVAs and administrations reduced the portfolio occupancy rate by 250 basis points to 96.9%.
Developments and UK other properties recognised a revaluation gain of 30 million, of which 23 million was from the development portfolio and 2 was principally associated with the progress made on the 44,300m Les 3 Fontaines extension where works commenced at the beginning of the year.
UK other properties generated a gain of 7 million largely due to progress made with City Quarters development opportunities including mixed-use schemes in Bristol and Birmingham.
Once again, premium outlets delivered the strongest performance in the year, achieving a valuation gain of 56 million, of which 40 million was attributable to income growth and a further 16 million due to yield improvements.
The most significant of these were at La Valle Village, Paris, Las Rozas Village, Madrid and Freeport Lisboa Fashion Outlet.

The UK other portfolio is not shown above and produced like-for-like ERV growth of 0.3% 2017: 1.6%.
Like-for-like ERV at the Groups investment properties declined by 0.9% in 2018 compared to growth of 0.9% in 2017.
ERVs at UK flagships fell by 2.0% in 2018, compared with 0.9% growth achieved in 2017.
The most significant declines were at Victoria Gate, Silverburn and Grand Central.
These were due to a combination of vacancy, reduction in commercialisation ERVs and more challenging negotiations at lease expiry and rent review.
ERVs in France increased by 0.5%.
The strongest performer was Les Terrasses du Port which achieved ERV growth of 2.3%, enhanced by uplifts on both the car park and rooftop.
Ireland produced the highest level of growth at 2.8%, having generated 2.7% in 2017.
All three Irish flagships achieved like-for-like ERV increases with Pavilions, Swords generating the strongest growth of 6.7%.
ERV at UK retail parks fell by 2.7%, compared with a 0.1% decline in 2017.
This was due to the impact of CVAs and higher vacancy.

The UK other portfolio is not shown above and produced an income return of 4.5%, a capital return of 4.5% and a total return of 9.2%.
The combined total return for the UK portfolio was -6.4% with a capital return of -10.7%..
The Groups property portfolio generated a nil total return in 2018, comprising a capital return of -4.3% and an income return of 4.4%.
The strongest performer was again the premium outlets sector which generated a total return of 7.4%, primarily due to the revaluation gain of 56 million across the combined outlet portfolios.
We compare the individual portfolio returns against their respective MSCI benchmarks and compare the Groups portfolio against a weighted 60:40 UK All Retail Universe: Bespoke Europe excluding UK All Retail Universe index.
These indices include returns from all types of retail property.
As the annual MSCI benchmarks are not available until after this Annual Report has been published, it is not yet possible to gauge the Groups comparative performance.
The UK MSCI Quarterly All Retail Universe to December 2018 is available and reported a total return of -0.3%, 610 basis points higher than the Groups UK portfolio return of -6.4%.
The Quarterly UK MSCI index included a total return of -4.6% for shopping centres, 1.5% for standard shops and -1.2% for retail warehouses.
Compared to the quarterly index, the UK flagships underperformed their comparative MSCI index by 190 basis points, whilst UK retail parks underperformed by 730 basis points.
In 2018, the Reported Group portfolio see Financial Review on page 48 for explanation produced a total return of -1.1%, whilst properties held by our joint ventures and associates generated a total return of 0.8%.
The performance of the latter portfolio was boosted by the strong return from premium outlets.
An analysis of the capital and total returns by business segment is included in Table 94 on page 180.

3.0 For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Groups return on shareholders equity was -3.2%, which compares to the Groups estimated cost of equity of 8.4%.
The income element of the return on equity tends to be relatively low given the high-quality nature of the Groups property portfolio.
The capital element of the return was driven by the portfolios adverse valuation movement during the year.
Hammersons total shareholder return for 2018 was -28.8%, an underperformance compared with the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index of 12.4 percentage points as the wider index has declined less than the Companys share price during 2018.
Over the last five years, the Groups average annual total shareholder return has been a reduction of 11.0%, compared to growth of 3.0% for the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index.
