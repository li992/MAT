Our journey Our objective in 2014 was to be the UKs leading independently-owned provider of investment management services to private clients, charities and trustees.
From a starting point of 22.0 billion, we have grown to manage 44.1 billion today.
The combination of organic growth, earnings-enhancing acquisitions, positive investment performance, favourable markets and effective cost management has also helped Rathbones create and maintain value for shareholders and employees alike.
