With investment yields at historic lows it has become increasingly difficult to find attractive acquisition opportunities.
We continue to monitor the market closely and as a result we were able to make 81 million of targeted acquisitions in 2018, which SEGRO Business Park Warsaw is will help us to achieve scale in key markets.

OURURBAN WAREHOUSE PORTFOLIO IN BOENA KRAWCZYK CONTINENTAL EUROPE INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, SEGRO CENTRAL EUROPE Urban warehouses account for almost two-thirds of our portfolio and we believe they offer attractive long-term returns as urbanisation and the e-commerce revolution drive greater occupier demand for warehouse space in and around population centres.
These warehouses are crucial for ensuring rapid delivery of goods and services to their final destination so-called last mile delivery, most notably for parcel distribution companies, retailers and food producers.
In addition, land zoned for industrial use in cities is declining as urban populations grow and this land is used instead to create new housing.
This combination of strong and growing demand and limited and often declining land supply represents a favourable environment for urban warehousing both now and into the future.
Although we usually develop urban warehouses ourselves, we took the opportunity to add to our Continental European urban warehouse portfolio in 2018 through a number of targeted acquisitions.
In Poland, we acquired IDEAL IDEA Park IV since renamed SEGRO Business Park Warsaw, a 18,600sqm estate approximately 9km from Warsaw city centre.
Poland lags behind the rest of Europe in terms of e-commerce penetration but it is growing and as a result urban warehouse space is increasingly in demand.
In France, we purchased a 19,200 sq m multi-let urban warehouse neighbouring our existing holdings in LeBlanc-Mesnil, Paris.
Both of these assets were fully let on acquisition and are in markets that we believe to have good growth potential.
We will use our expertise in the urban warehousing sector to add value to these new estates through active asset management.
We also took the opportunity to acquire a 19.4 per cent interest in French listed property company Sofibus Patrimoine.
Sofibus largest holding comprises 127,000 sq m of urban warehouse properties within Le Parc dActivites des Petits Carreaux, a 150,000 sq m estate located approximately 15km south east of Paris.

There are two main ways that we add value to our portfolio.
Firstly, we drive rental growth from our existing assets, owning prime buildings in the best locations and by building strong relationships with our customers.
Staying close to them and anticipating We have considerable momentum their needs helps us to keep retention rates high and vacancy rates low.
We also pro-actively maintain at SLP East Midlands Gateway, and refurbish our assets, ensuring that they remain where we are creating a state of attractive to potential occupiers.
the art, multi-modal logistics hub.
Secondly, we look to add value through the development of new warehouse space, generating new ANDREW PILSWORTH rental income and development profits.
We completed BUSINESS UNIT DIRECTOR, NATIONAL LOGISTICS 673,400 sq m of new developments in 2018, capable of generating 40 million of rent once fully let, of which 34 million has already been secured.
CASE STUDY: ADDING VALUE THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AT SEGRO LOGISTICS PARK EAST MIDLANDS GATEWAY A great example of adding value through development can be seen at SEGRO Logistics Park East Midlands Gateway SLP-EMG.
This site started out as 700 acres of steeply sloping farmland, secured as part of our partnership with Roxhill in 2016.
The site is adjacent to East Midlands Airport which is the UKs second largest airport for air cargo and has direct access to the M1, making it a very attractive location for big box logistics warehousing.
However, the local road network was already overloaded so it required an ambitious infrastructure scheme for it to fulfil its potential.
We have invested 90 million into the transport infrastructure including completely reengineering J24 of the M1 and moving the A50 southbound to the opposite side of the motorway.
In addition, we built a new road to bypass Kegworth, finally achieving a goal long fought for by local communities.
A Strategic Rail Freight interchange SRFI has been created that combines a 22.5 acre freight terminal and a new section of track linking to the Castle Donnington freight line, which will provide access to the UK rail freight network as well as major UK ports.
We signed a 25 year lease in early 2019 with Maritime Transport, the market-leading multi-modal logistics company, who will operate the interchange and base their Rail Headquarters at the site.
SLP-EMG is capable of supporting 550,000 sq m of big box warehouse space which we estimate will generate more than 7,250 jobs for the region.
In early 2018, we agreed transactions with four occupiers for 250,000 sq m of new warehousing across four buildings.
Construction of the warehouses started in March and will be completed in Spring 2019, generating 11.7 million of rental income.

We carry out a detailed review of our portfolio every year to identify assets where we believe we can maximise returns from recycling them, allowing us todeploy our capital into other opportunities.
During 2018 we disposed of 372 million of assets and 70 million of land.
These disposals included the sale of four big box warehouses and adjacent development land owned by SELP in Belgium for 83 million SEGRO share: 41.7 million.
This transaction successfully concluded our presence in Belgium, in line with our strategy to exit markets where we do not have, or do not expect to achieve, ascale position.
CASE STUDY: SELLING WELL TO CAPITALISE ON STRONG INVESTOR DEMAND AND RELEASE CAPITAL TO REINVEST One of our largest disposals this year was the sale of a 158,000 sq m distribution facility on the outskirts of Rome, developed by Vailog, SEGROs Italian subsidiary.
The unit, the largest SEGRO has ever developed, was built for one of our major customers and developed in line with their specific requirements for a new format fulfilment centre, the first of its kind in Europe.
The building included two mezzanine levels and was designed with a high degree of automation in mind, as well as being able to withstand seismic activity in the region.
The unit was signed on a 15 year lease and completed in August 2017.
Our investment team identified strong investor demand for such well-let, state-of-the-art buildings andcarried out a process of marketing it for sale.
We completed the disposal in October 2018 for 118 million, capitalising on the strong investor demand and crystallising a healthy profit on development cost, allowing us to recycle the proceedsinto our active development pipeline.

PHIL REDDING CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER 20 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 OUR BUSINESS MODEL IN ACTION SELP Our partnership with PSP Investments has allowed us to build scale in Continental European big box warehouses ina capital efficient manner.
SEGRO EUROPEAN LOGISTICS PARTNERSHIP SELP In 2018 we celebrated the five year anniversary of SELP, our Continental European big box joint venture with PSP Investments, one of Canadas largestpension investment managers.
SELP started out in 2013 with 1 billion of assets.
At the end of 2018, it has a portfolio worth over 3.5 billion.
It generates 191 million of headline rent and is 97per cent occupied.
This partnership was a vital element of our strategy to build scale in Continental European big box warehousing in a capital efficient manner.
By sharing the capital investment with PSP Investments, we were able to grow the portfolio further and faster than we could have done on our own.
Both partners benefit from the attractive yield on the portfolio, the development potential from the land and from the economies of scale we can extract from this extremely high quality, modern collection of big box warehouses.
As a result, SEGRO now has approximately 1 billion assets in each of Germany, France and Poland, and we are building scale in the smaller markets of Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.
The appetite for investing in big box warehousing in strategic locations in Continental Europe remains strong from both partners and we look forward to further successful collaboration into the future.
