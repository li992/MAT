Employee engagement In 2018, we launched our first global staff survey.
Ensuring our employees have a voice and are heard is important to us and is key to the successful delivery of the Groups strategy.
We will be monitoring the percentage of our staff, worldwide, who choose to participate in the survey as a benchmark for monitoring the progress we make in our employee engagement in the future.
We may in future derive other KPIs from the survey once it becomes embedded across the Group.
The percentage of people participating in our global staff survey was 62%.
