2 We did achieve our aim to donate 3.4 million to the Greggs Foundation.
We didnt fully launch our new Foundation Software system in 2018 as commissioning and testing to make sure it worked fully and correctly was not completed by the end of the year but will be implemented fully in early 2019.
3 We tested a number of initiatives to reduce single-use plastic in 2018 and intend to roll these out across the whole estate in 2019.
This includes replacing plastic carrier bags with paper, replacing plastic cutlery with wood and removal of plastic sheets for confectionery products once implemented this will remove over 300 tonnes of plastic from our operations.
In addition, we trialled instore collection of used hot drinks cups any brand and are also part of the two significant recycling schemes for used hot drinks cups ACEUK and Valpak, incentivising the wider waste industry to implement collection infrastructures across the UK.
4 While we have made significant progress in this area, it is important to us that our colleagues help to shape the programme.
This consultative approach has required a longer lead time than first anticipated.
5 We saw a fantastic improvement in our supply and logistics operations with a 35 per cent improvement, however our retail performance dipped compared to 2017 results which showed an unprecedented improvement but the result was still a further improvement on 2015 and 2016 showing a general improving trend.
