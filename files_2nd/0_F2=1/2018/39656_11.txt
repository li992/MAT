Strategic Report Group Chief Financial Officers review am pleased to report that the Group has delivered a robust financial performance.
Underlying Profit Before Tax is 1.4% higher at 190.1m.
Strong cash I flows and conversion have enabled us to continue to deleverage to 1.7x from 1.9x at the start of the year.
Net Strong cash flows debt has reduced from 464.9m to 432.0m.
Based on these results and the stability of our highly cash generative model, we propose to increase our final and conversion dividend to 6.0p, leading to growth in the full year dividend of 5.9% to 9.0p per share.
Profit before tax have enabled us from continuing operations has decreased by 7.6% to 178.7m 2017: 193.3m.
to continue to deleverage to 1.7x from 1.9x at the start of the year.

Sagas total customer spend increased by 2.3% to 1,209m 2017: 1,182m.
This includes gross written premiums and insurance premium tax on all insurance policies sold.
A strong performance in Travel was offset by a decline in the written to earned benefit in Retail Broking.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 0.8m due to the planned investment in software within our insurance business and the maintenance of the Saga Sapphire in the prior year.
Underlying Profit Before Tax increased by 1.4% to 190.1m 2017: 187.4m.
The benefit of lower net finance costs and amortisation of acquired intangibles was offset by an increase in the pension charge under IAS19R and higher non-trading costs.
The increase in pension charge was due to the effect of low corporate bond yields as at 1 February 2017 driving down the discount rate used in the accounting valuation of the pension current service cost for the year.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 37 Strategic Report Group Chief Financial Officers review continued Profit before tax from continuing operations was 178.7m for the year.
This is a decrease of 7.6% due to the derivative losses that impacted the business following the weakening of sterling, the one-off costs associated with the unamortised facility fees of our previous banking facilities and the one-off restructuring costs incurred as a result of a review of the Groups cost base.
This was partially offset by a one-time 4.0m profit impact in the prior year from the change in the Ogden discount rate from 2.5% to -0.75% that was announced by the UK Government on 27 February 2017.
Net finance costs Net finance costs in the year were 12.5m 2017: 16.7m.
This reduction has been achieved through the Group obtaining an overall lower average cost of debt following the refinancing of its debt earlier in the year along with lower average borrowings during the year.
The cost of the external bank debt is now linked to the Groups leverage ratio and the continuing deleveraging has enabled the Group to be charged interest at the low end of the range.
Tax expense The Groups tax expense for the year was 33.6m 2017: 36.0m representing an effective tax rate of 18.8% 2017: 18.6%.
The current year benefited from a lower corporation tax rate.
The prior year benefited from a 2.7m one-off positive impact from the utilisation of tax losses brought forward from the Allied business that was disposed of on 1 December 2015.
Going forward, the tax charge is likely to be more in line with the underlying corporation tax rate.
Discontinued operations The loss after tax from discontinued operations is in relation to the sale of Allied Healthcare in the year ended 31 January 2016.
The Group received deferred consideration in the form of two loan notes with face value of 3.5m each which attract uncompounded interest at a rate of 5% due to mature on 30 May 2018 and 30 May 2019.
In the year to 31 January 2018, following an impairment review, management no longer consider the loan notes to be recoverable and as such have impaired the loan notes to nil.
Earnings per share The Groups underlying earnings per share from continuing operations were 13.8p 2017: 13.7p.
The Groups basic earnings per share were 12.3p 2017: 14.1p, with basic earnings per share from continuing operations for the same period of 13.0p 2017: 14.1p.
Dividends In determining the level of dividend in any year in accordance with the policy, the Board also considers a number of other factors that influence the proposed dividend.
These include but are not limited to: the level of available distributable reserves: future cash commitments and investment needs, including Sagas new ships: availability of cash resources: and consideration of prevailing risks and uncertainties as documented on pages 24-29.
Reflecting Sagas strong cash generation and confidence in the business, the Directors have proposed a final dividend of 6.0p per share.
Combined with the interim dividend of 3.0p per share, this will deliver a total dividend for the financial year ended 31 January 2018 of 9.0p per share 2017: 8.5p.
This equates to a payout ratio of 65% compared with the Groups underlying earnings per share from continuing operations.
Looking ahead the Board is committed to a long-term sustainable dividend policy.
The increase in the dividend to this level reflects our ongoing confidence in the stability of our highly cash generative model.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 38 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Saga plc has 1,249.2m of distributable reserves at 31 January 2018 available for distribution to support the dividend policy.
The distributable reserves of Saga plc are equal to the balance of the retained earnings reserve of 1,249.2m as at 31 January 2018.
If necessary, its subsidiary companies hold significant reserves from which a dividend can be paid to support Saga plcs dividend policy.
Subsidiary distributable reserves are available immediately with the exception of companies within the Travel and Underwriting segments, which require regulatory approval before any dividends can be declared and paid.
Saga offers a share alternative in the form of a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP for those shareholders who wish to elect to use their dividend payments to purchase additional shares in the Group, rather than receiving a cash payment.
The last date for shareholders to elect to participate in the DRIP will be 4 June 2018.
The record date will be 18 May 2018 and the final dividend will be paid on 29 June 2018.
Payment of the final dividend of 6.0p per share remains subject to shareholder approval at the Companys 2018 Annual General Meeting.
Cash flow and liquidity Available operating cash flow is made up of the unrestricted cash flows from the Retail Broking and Emerging Businesses and Central Costs, plus any dividends paid by our restricted businesses, Underwriting and Travel.
The Group delivered a strong cash flow performance in the year to 31 January 2018, achieving an available operating cash flow of 175.5m, 70.2% of Trading EBITDA.
This cash flow decreased by 42.1m on the previous period, which was primarily driven by a more normalised dividend paid from AICL, as the initial reduction in solvency capital from the introduction of the quota share in the prior year reduces.
The reduction in working capital outflow is due to the decrease in the written to earned adjustment.

The refinancing strengthened the Groups balance sheet by extending the maturity profile and increasing the diversity of its sources of borrowings.
The overall level of indebtedness did not change.
Continued strong cash flows have enabled the Group to continue to deleverage to a debt ratio net debt to Trading EBITDA of 1.7 from 1.9.
The Groups net debt is made up as follows: 31 Jan 31 Jan Net debt 2018 2017 Corporate bond 250.0m Term loan 180.0m 380.0m Revolving credit facility 15.0m 100.0m 1 Less available cash 13.0m 15.1m Net debt 432.0m 464.9m Note: 1 Refer to note 21 of the financial statements for information as to how this reconciles to a statutory measure of cash Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 40 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Pensions Over the year, the valuation of the Groups pension scheme has strengthened on an IAS19R basis by 6.7m to a deficit of 7.0m January 2017: deficit 13.7m : 12m to 12m to Saga Scheme Jan 2018 Jan 2017 Fair value of scheme assets 307.3m 276.8m Present value of defined benefit obligation 314.3m 290.5m Defined benefit scheme liability 7.0m 13.7m The strengthening has been driven by a 30.5m increase in the fair value of the scheme assets to 307.3m January 2017: 276.8m.
This was partially offset by an increase in the scheme liabilities of 23.8m to 314.3m January 2017: 290.5m, driven by a fall in corporate bond yields over the period.
Net assets Since 31 January 2017, total assets and liabilities have reduced by 55.0m and 83.3m respectively, increasing overall net assets by 28.3m.
The decrease in total assets is as a result of a decrease in financial assets of 85.8m, which coincides with the release of surplus solvency capital from the Groups Underwriting business and a decrease in cash and short-term deposits of 25.5m.
This was partly offset by an increase in intangible fixed assets of 7.4m due to increased investment in IT systems, and an increase in trade and other receivables of 11.3m.
The latter was primarily due to an increase in prepayments, which includes significant commitment fees on the two new ships and an increase in property, plant and equipment of 31.9m, which includes the second and third stage payments for Spirit of Discovery of 13.2m and 13.9m respectively and the first stage payment for Spirit of Adventure of 15.2m.
The reduction in total liabilities reflects a 20.6m reduction in financial liabilities following the repayment of debt during the year, enabled through continued positive cash generation and the release of surplus solvency capital.
This was coupled with an associated 60.3m reduction in gross insurance contract liabilities in line with further positive claims experience throughout the year.

QS 97.7% 1.9ppt 99.6% Total revenue for the Retail Broking business on a written basis decreased by 1.3% to 275.4m 2017: 279.1m.
This was mainly due to ongoing challenges in the home market and a reduction in travel policies.
Revenue from the written to earned WTE adjustment has decreased by 61.3% to 7.2m 2017: 18.6m.
This was mainly due to a reduction in the motor WTE adjustment.
The WTE adjustment is required when the Group underwrites the portion of policies that it sells in its broker business to spread the broker revenue earned on those policies, and associated direct costs, over the period of cover.
Revenue for the Underwriting business decreased by 12.0% to 98.8m 2017: 112.3m, due to the accounting for the quota share agreement in motor insurance, which required 126.6m 2017: 110.5m of earned premiums ceded Note: 1 Please refer to page 46 for details of how this alternative performance measure is calculated and defined Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 42 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements under the agreement to be accounted for as a deduction from revenue.
The net impact on profit of the quota share was a 2.1m cost 2017: 1.6m cost.
Travel revenue increased by 3.9% to 448.8m, due to revenue growth in both the Tour Operations and Cruise businesses.
Underlying Profit Before Tax in the Retail Broking insurance business on a written basis has increased by 4.3%, primarily due to higher average revenue per policy in motor.
Underwriting profit increased by 2.1m, from an increase in investment return.
Travel underlying profits increased by 36.9%, due to higher average revenues and less ship maintenance days during the year compared with last year.
Emerging Businesses and Central Costs saw a 6.8% decrease in its underlying loss before tax reflecting the reduction in finance costs and central cost base, partially offset by an increase in the IAS19R pension charge.
Gross written premiums from business underwritten by third party underwriters increased by 4.3% to 102.1m 2017: 97.9m, as the number of policies underwritten by third parties increased by 4.3ppt to 17.0% 2017: 12.7%.
Gross written premiums from business underwritten within the Group increased by 0.5% to 223.8m 2017: 222.6m due to an increase in average premiums partially offset by a decrease in the number of policies sold.
The discontinuation of the Direct Choice brand impacted both policies and gross written premiums.
Saga branded policies reduced by 3.4%.
Written broker revenue has increased by 17.2% to 42.3m 2017: 36.1m reflecting a positive trading environment that saw written revenue per policy increase strongly with premium inflation increasing ahead of the claims inflation during the year.
When excluding the discontinued Direct Choice brand, broker revenue increased by 23.0% to 41.5m 2017: 33.7m.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 43 Strategic Report Group Chief Financial Officers review continued Written instalment revenue has increased by 2.4m to 7.1m 2017: 4.7m following the insourcing of the Bennetts debtor book during the prior year and an increase in the number of Saga customers paying by instalments coupled with higher premiums.
Written add-on revenue has decreased by 3.7m to 28.9m 2017: 32.6m due to the reduction in core policies and a decrease in add-on penetration.
Overall, this has led to written revenue increasing by 5.2% to 117.8m 2017: 112.0m.
Written marketing expenses have decreased by 15.6%, reflecting a reduction in aggregator volumes and improved efficiency of marketing spend.
Written operating expenses have decreased by 1.5% as a result of programmes to deliver operational efficiencies across the Broking business and savings associated with the closure of the Direct Choice brand.
As a result, underlying written profit before tax has increased by 37.3% to 39.0m 2017: 28.4m.
The profit impact of the WTE adjustment has decreased by 13.4m to 3.4m 2017: 16.8m with a 6.6m increase in the deferral of broker revenue on policies associated with AICL, driven by an increase in average premiums and 6.5m due to the introduction of the arrangement fee in November 2015 accelerating earnings in the prior year only.
Core policies have fallen by 5.4% which has led to decreases in earned revenue and earned profit to 85.0m and 56.6m respectively 2017: 89.8m and 61.2m.
The positive home WTE adjustment in the current and prior year reflects the standard accounting treatments, as the Group has moved towards a capital light broking model whereby add-ons were fully outsourced to a third party underwriter.
These benefits will no longer occur in future years and we expect there to be no home WTE adjustment going forward.

This was driven by higher net rates in Q1 2017, due to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, which made us less competitive in the market.
This disadvantage has now unwound.
Private medical insurance revenue also decreased due to lower average broker revenues.
This resulted in a decrease in Underlying Profit Before Tax of 1.3% to 31.2m 2017: 31.6m.

The Underwriting business delivered an improved pure combined operating ratio of 97.7% 2017: 99.6%.
Investment return increased by 1.5m to 16.2m 2017: 14.7m with a profit from the on sale of some bonds partially offset by a lower yield on a smaller investment portfolio.
The lower yield resulted from historical fixed income investments that have matured and the funds have been reinvested at current market rates.
Total investments have reduced as surplus solvency capital has been released, which has been driven by continued favourable claims experience and an increase in the number of accident years covered by the quota share agreement.
Despite the lower level of underlying reserve releases, profit from Underwriting activity has increased to 79.2m 2017: 77.1m.

This has been driven by the experience on large and small personal injury claims and has enabled reserve releases on motor totalling 64.0m during the year.
There has been no deterioration in the underlying reserve margin held over best estimate claims reserves year on year in percentage terms.
The strengthening of prior year reserves for home and other insurance are in respect of products sold by third parties for which the Group has in place profit and loss sharing agreements such that the associated impact on profit is negligible.

The reduction in IBNR claims reserves was mainly due to favourable experience on large and small personal injury claims.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 47 Strategic Report Group Chief Financial Officers review continued Investment portfolio The majority of the Groups financial assets are held by its Underwriting entity and represent premium income received and invested to settle claims and to meet regulatory capital requirements.
The maturity profile of the invested financial assets is aligned with the expected cash outflow profile associated with the settlement of claims in the future.
The amount held in invested funds decreased by 71.5m compared with the previous year, from 546.8m as at 31 January 2017 to 475.3m as at 31 January 2018.

The Tour Operations business generated a 2.9% increase in revenue to 360.4m 2017: 350.1m from a decrease in passengers to 184k 2017: 190k.
Approximately half of the decrease in passengers was due to the cancellations following the Monarch insolvency.
The increased spend per passenger has primarily been driven by the foreign exchange impact of weak sterling, but also a continued shift in product mix towards higher-value long-haul, river cruise and third party cruise products.
Gross profit margin was impacted by cost associated with the Monarch insolvency and adverse foreign exchange movements but was more than offset by operational savings.
Underlying Profit Before Tax from Tour Operations increased by 20.0% to 13.8m at an increased profit margin of 3.8% 2017: 3.3%.
The insolvency of Monarch had a profit impact of approximately 2.0m during the year.
Saga Cruising delivered a 7.9% increase in revenue to 88.4m 2017: 81.9m reflecting an increase in passenger days of 22k, in part driven by an increase in capacity days.
The Saga Pearl was out of operation for scheduled maintenance for 19 days in April 2017 and the Saga Sapphire had a scheduled maintenance of 20 days in November 2017.
This compared with 63 days of maintenance on the Saga Sapphire in the prior year.
Underlying Profit Before Tax from the Cruising business almost doubled to 6.6m 2017: 3.4m, led by the increase in passenger days, lower fuel prices, and improved operating efficiency, partly offset by initial marketing spend for Spirit of Discovery, due for delivery in June 2019.
On the 20 September 2017, the Saga plc Board approved the purchase of the second cruise ship, Spirit of Adventure, with an earlier delivery date of August 2020, and the Group exercised the option in December 2017.
The financing for Spirit of Adventure represents a 12 year fixed rate sterling loan at an interest cost of 2.63% overall cost of 3.3% per annum fixed, backed by an export credit guarantee.
The loan value of approximately 295m will be repaid in 24 broadly equal instalments, with the first payment is due six months after delivery.
On the date the finance was entered into, the Group purchased Euro currency forwards totalling 211.5m which represents 72% of the cost of the ship.

Central Costs reduced to 22.4m 2017: 25.2m due to cost savings initiatives.
The Group saw a 4.0m increase in the IAS19R charge due to prevailing market conditions, particularly in the bond market, as at 1 February 2017.
This was offset by lower debt service costs, driven by lower levels of debt, which led to a 4.2m reduction in net finance costs to 12.5m 2017: 16.7m.
This resulted in a loss from Central Costs of 40.4m 2017: 43.4m.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 50 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Previous trading guidance On 6 December 2017, the Group published a Trading Update stating that the Groups growth in Underlying PBT was expected to be between 1% and 2% for the year ended 31 January 2018.
Within the Chief Financial Officers review for the year ended 31 January 2017, the following statement was made in respect of the year ended 31 January 2018, The Group is aiming to deliver ongoing consistent profit growth this year.
The Groups published Underlying PBT within this Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 January 2018 is 190.1m which represents 1.4% growth.
Financial outlook and guidance During the year ending 31 January 2019, written profits from insurance broking are expected to be relatively flat with lower costs and improvements in net revenues will be offset by an incremental investment of approximately 5m in policy growth.
There will be a negative movement in the written to earned accounting adjustment of approximately 10m.
For Tour Operating, higher revenues are expected to drive incremental profit, but the additional investment of approximately 5m in passenger growth in 2019 20 will mean that profit will be relatively stable year on year.
While Cruise has more capacity days to sell with no dry docks this year, the hedging on fuel and foreign exchange for the current year are less advantageous than last year, therefore Cruise profits will also remain flat year on year.
Lower costs and limited IAS19R pension charge in Central Costs will provide a profit improvement year on year.
With average net debt expected to be lower year on year, finance costs are expected to reduce again in the coming year.
Reserve releases are expected to reduce this current year by c. 10-15m.
Subject to market conditions remaining materially consistent, the Group is aiming to deliver Underlying Profit approximately 5% lower than in the year to 31 January 2018.
While the Groups leverage reduced materially in the year to 31 January 2018, the rate of any reduction is expected to be lower this year due to our profit guidance.
