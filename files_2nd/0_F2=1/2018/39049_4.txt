DEVELOPMENT N Tolmount Premier's next UK growth project The sanction of our operated Tolmount Main gas field, which Premier acquired at low-cost as part of the 2016 E. ON transaction, marks a major milestone for the Group.
Construction of the platform started in December and the project is progressing as planned.
With first gas scheduled for the end of 2020, Tolmount Main underpins our medium-term UK growth profile.
