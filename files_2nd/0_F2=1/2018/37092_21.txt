This overall reward strategy is the foundation for the Remuneration Policy for senior executives.
The over-arching objectives of the Remuneration Policy are to ensure rewards are performance-based and encourage long-term shareholder value creation.
The Remuneration Policy for our senior executives is based on the following principles: Encourages the Linked to our Aligned to right behaviours Secures high Enables share business strategy our values to deliver calibre leaders ownership long-term growth The Committee takes a rounded approach to pay and considers a variety of factors when determining, and subsequently implementing, the policy for senior executives.
The Committee believes it is important to exercise sound judgement at all stages during the process to ensure that executive pay levels appropriately reflect performance and are aligned with the interests ofshareholders.
When reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee considers our business goals, pay practices across the Company and the retail sector more generally, the impact on colleagues, the cost to the Company, stakeholder views including shareholders, governance bodies and colleagues and bestpractice.

Where relevant, the Committee also considers external market data on salary and total remuneration but the Committee applies judgement when considering such data.
The salary review for management and central colleagues in March 2018 was generally two per cent and for hourly paid retail colleagues in August 2017 was 4.4 per cent.
For 2018 19, Mike Coupe, Kevin OByrne and John Rogers will receive a salary increase of two per cent effective March 2018, in line with other management colleagues.
Pension In lieu of pension plan participation, Mike Coupe receives a cash pension supplement of 30 per cent of salary and Kevin OByrne and John Rogers receive 25 per cent of salary.
No Director has any entitlement to a Sainsburys defined benefit pension.
As communicated in last years Remuneration Report, under the forward looking policy, retirement benefits for any future appointments are capped at 25 per cent of salary, rather than the previous limit of 30 per cent.
Benefits For 2017 18 and 2018 19, benefits for Executive Directors include the provision of company car benefits, private medical cover, long-term disability insurance, life assurance and colleague discount.
Benefits for John Rogers also include an annual travel allowance and accommodation costs in relation to a change of location to Milton Keynes following appointment as CEO of Sainsburys Argos.
Performance-related pay The Committee believes it is important that a significant portion of the Executive Directors package is performance-related and that the performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Companys strategy and the long-term sustainable success of the Company.
The specific metrics incorporated into the annual bonus, Deferred Share Award and Future Builder are built around the overall strategy and our key priorities.
The Board is of the opinion that the performance targets for the 2018 19 annual bonus and Deferred Share Award are commercially sensitive as the Company operates in a highly competitive, consumer-facing sector.
The disclosure of targets would provide competitors with insights into the Companys strategic aims, budgeting and growth projections.
However, in line with previous years, the Company is retrospectively disclosing the financial performance targets set for the 2017 18 annual bonus in order to provide greater transparency and detailed disclosure is also provided in relation to the Deferred Share Award so that shareholders can understand the basis for payments.
Targets for Future Builder awards have been disclosed on a prospective basis.

Around 240 senior managers across the business participate in this arrangement.
Awards are granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in 2016.
Future Builder awards have been granted under the same structure for a number of years.
A core award of shares is granted, calculated as a percentage of salary and scaled according to level of seniority.
Vesting of the core award is dependent on performance against specific targets tested at the end of athree-year performance period.
The core awards can grow up to four times at stretch levels of performance.
Historically, awards have been structured so that half of any awards vest following the end of the performance period, with the remaining half vesting after a further year.
For awards granted to Executive Directors from 2017 onwards, awards will normally be subject to a two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performance period.
This will result in awards to Executive Directors being released after a five-year period.
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the Companys underlying performance over the period justifies the level of vesting: vesting will be reduced if not.
When making this judgement the Committee has scope to consider such factors as it deems relevant.
The Committee believes that this discretion is an important feature of the plan and mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes.
This performance gateway assessment applies to all outstanding Future Builder awards.
2018 Future Builder awards 2021 vesting Award levels will remain unchanged for the coming year.
In 2018 Mike Coupe will receive a core award of 62.5 per cent of salary maximum 250 per cent of salary and the other Executive Directors will receive core awards of 50 per cent of salary maximum 200 per cent of salary.
The 2018 awards will be subject to four metrics: ROCE, EPS, free cash flow and cost savings.
The cash element for the 2018 award has been refined to focus on free cash flow, as this metric better aligns with how performance is tracked both internally and externally.
Free cash flow is considered to be more relevant to our shareholders as it represents cash flow that can ultimately be returned to shareholders via dividends or reinvested into the business.
Synergy targets relating to the HRG acquisition are expected to be broadly realised over the next two years, and have therefore been removed from the plan as they are less relevant for the 2018 19-2021 22 performance cycle.
Participants will continue to be motivated towards achieving these synergies as HRG synergy targets will continue to apply to Future Builder awards granted in 2016 and 2017.
The ROCE, EPS and cost savings targets have been reviewed, and the Committee remains confident that the target ranges remain realistic but stretching and reflect the current and future prospects of the business as well as the retail sector as a whole over the next three years.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Governance Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 75 The agreed measures, targets and weightings for the 2018 awards are as follows: Threshold Maximum target target 1.0x core 4.0x core Measure Weighting award award ROCE 25% 8.0% 11.0% Underlying basic EPS 25% 23.0p 30.0p Cumulative free cash flow 25% 800m 1,300m Cumulative strategic cost savings 25% 450m 550m 2018 Future Builder performance measures definitions for Free cash flow other awards can be found in the relevant Annual Report Free cash flow measures the total flow of cash in and out of the business as well as providing an assessment of underlying ROCE profitability.

2015 Future Builder 2015 16 to 2017 18 performance period audited information The 2015 Future Builder award was subject to ROCE, EPS, cash flow and cost savings targets.
In addition, a performance gateway had to be achieved before any element could vest.
Following the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc in September 2016, the targets were reviewed taking into account the performance of the enlarged Group.
As detailed in last years report, following a detailed assessment, the Committee was satisfied that the targets originally set for this award remained appropriately stretching and that no adjustments were required.
The following table sets out the extent to which each performance measure was achieved.
This resulted in a performance multiplier of 1.7x which is applied to the core award, i. e. 42.5 per cent of the maximum available award vested.

When assessing cost savings, the performance criteria agreed at the start of the performance period included savings relating to planned changes in marketing costs.
These additional savings resulted in a total of 71 million over the period in addition to the 540 million reported on page 8.
