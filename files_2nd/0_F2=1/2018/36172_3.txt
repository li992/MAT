Elite porcine breeding herds are also Growth in conventional Growth in sexed Growth in embryos consolidating.
This consolidation is semen semen driven by the increasing cost and use of Growth rates refer to actual volume growth rates for 2018 delivered by ABS.
Conventional and sexed technology to keep pace with industry volumes relate to global dairy semen volumes.
Embryos relate to total global embryo volumes.
As genetics consolidate, some breeders are choosing to enter into strategic alliances with competitors, so that they can offer their customers superior genetics.
