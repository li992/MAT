Strategic report STRATEGIC REPORT COPPER COPPER In Chile, we have interests in two major copper operations: a 50.1% interest in the Los Bronces mine, which we manage and operate, and a 44% share in the Collahuasi mine: we also manage and operate the El Soldado mine and Chagres smelter, where we have a 50.1% interest in each.
In Peru, we have a 60% interest in the Quellaveco project approved for development in 2018.
HIGHLIGHTS STRATEGIC FOCUS Successful development of the Quellaveco copper project.
On track for delivery in 2022 23% Continued focus on productivity improvements and increase in underlying EBITDA cost reductions at Los Bronces Hennie Faul Completion of pre-feasibility study for the CEO Copper Los Bronces Underground project $1.9 billion Further plant improvements at Collahuasi, including the replacement of the second ball mill stator motor underlying EBITDA at Line 3 responsible for around 60% of plant throughput during the first half of 2019.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE Underlying EBITDA increased by 23% to $1,856 million At Los Bronces, production increased by 20% to 2017: $1,508 million, driven by higher production and 369,500 tonnes 2017: 308,300 tonnes owing to strong lower unit costs across all operations.
Unit costs decreased mine and plant performance, as well as planned higher by 9% to 134 c lb 2017: 147 c lb, the lowest since 2010, grades 0.76%vs.
C1 unit costs decreased as a result of increased production and continued by14% to 145 c lb 2017: 169 c lb reflecting the strong sustainable cost savings at all operations that fully offset operational performance and higher by-product credits the impact of inflation.
Production increased by 15% to primarily molybdenum.

At the same time, and aligned with the Groups disciplined approach to capital allocation, agreement was reached with Mitsubishi to increase its interest in Anglo American Quellaveco S. A. AAQSA from 18.1% to 40% via the issuance of new shares.
Mitsubishi subscribed $500 million in upfront consideration and an additional $351 million to fund its initial share of capital expenditure, resulting in a total cash subscription of $851 million.
The Group will receive up to 1 a further $100 million in net payments from AAQSA conditional on the achievement of certain prescribed throughput rates.
As aresult of the syndication transaction, the Groups share of capital expenditure to develop Quellaveco is $2.5-$2.7 billion.
Project update Project execution is on track, benefiting from early works completed during the feasibility study stage.
All major permits are in place.
In line with plan, the diversion of the Asana river was successfully completed in early December, the first major milestone of the project.
Engineering, contracting and procurement are well advanced, with earthworks also meaningfully progressed.
The full complement of accommodation required for workers will be available during the first half of 2019.
The priority in 2019 is to continue progressing earthworks and start concrete works at the plant site.
First production isdue in 2022, with the ramp-up complete in 2023.
The project will deliver around 300,000 tonnes per annum ofcopper equivalent production on average in the first 10years of operation.
Total capital expenditure funded by the Group in 2018 was $131 million, representing the Groups attributable share prior to projectapproval in July.
Post-approval, capital expenditure on a 100% basis was $318 million, of which 1 the Groups 60% share was funded from the syndication The payment, by way of preference transaction with Mitsubishi described above.
dividend, will be grossed up to take account of the Group OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK shareholding in AAQSA.
Production guidance for 2019 is 630,000-660,000 tonnes.
