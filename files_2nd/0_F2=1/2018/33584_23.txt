Strategic report STRATEGIC REPORT NICKEL AND MANGANESE NICKEL AND MANGANESE Our Nickel business is well placed to serve the global stainless steel industry, whichdepends on nickel and drives demand for it.
Our assets are in Brazil, with twoferronickel production sites: Barro Alto and Codemin.
Inmanganese, we have a 40% shareholding in Samancor, with operations inSouth Africa and Australia.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE Nickel Nickel Underlying EBITDA increased by 123% to $181 million Nickel output decreased by 3% to 42,300 tonnes 2017: $81 million, primarily reflecting the higher 2017:43,800 tonnes owing to a 40-day planned nickelprice.
maintenance stoppage at Barro Alto in the first half of 2018.
Barro Alto produced 33,500 tonnes Nickel unit costs decreased by 1% to 361 c lb 2017: 34,900 tonnes, while Codemin produced 2017:365c lb, despite lower production, driven by 8,800 tonnes 2017:8,900 tonnes.
improved operational stability and the effect of favourable exchange rates, partly offset by higher energy prices.
Samancor Attributable manganese ore production increased Samancor by 3% to3.6 Mt 2017: 3.5 Mt.
Production from the Underlying EBITDA increased by 25% to $663 million Australian operations increased by 10% due to improved 2017: $529 million, driven mainly by the continued concentrator availability, the effect of more favourable improvement in manganese ore prices.

Ferronickel is traded SouthAfrica, manganese alloy production improved by based on discounts or premiums to the LME price, 6%while continuing to utilise only one of the operations depending on market conditions, supplier products and four furnaces.
Differences between market prices and realised prices are largely due to variances between the LME and the ferronickel price.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK The nickel price increased by 26% to an average of Nickel 595 c lb in 2018, with strong demand growth maintaining Production guidance for 2019 is 42,000-44,000 tonnes.
In the second half of the year, however, prices came under pressure from macro-economic worries, including heightening trade war concerns.
Stainless steel production around 70% of nickel demand increased to record levels in 2018, while nickel consumption in batteries increased by more than 30%, as demand for zero emission vehicles and lithium-ion based energy storage continued to accelerate.
