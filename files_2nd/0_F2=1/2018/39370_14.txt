Strategic report | Business reviews Energy & Minerals The minerals we produce are essential to a wide variety of industries The products from our diverse agriculture to portfolio of high-quality mining, refining and marketing operations construction and and projects make important contributions to peoples everyday ultimately, to peoples lives, as well as to a wide variety of industries.
The Energy & Minerals E&M portfolio includes titanium dioxide, rutile and zircon: borates: iron Bold Baatar ore concentrate and pellets: salt: and uranium.
Chief executive, Energy & Minerals E&M products are used in everything from television screens to paints and plastics, and in industries from healthcare to aerospace.
As a key global supplier of borates, we account for approximately 25% of global demand with Operations in mining, processing, commercial and research facilities.
Our Iron & Titanium business is a major global producer of high-grade titanium dioxide 6 10 feedstock.
The Iron Ore Company of Canada countries mining sites produces premium iron ore pellets and high-grade concentrate with low levels of impurities.
We also have three operations at Dampier Salt, in Western Australia.
We continue to study the Jadar lithium-borate project in Serbia.
And in 2018, we also owned 5 10,000 interests in two uranium businesses Energy sectors: borates, iron ore employees Resources of Australia and Rssing Uranium in Namibia and a uranium project in Canada.
