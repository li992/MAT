Strategic Investment Financial Shareholder Report Review Governance Statements Information INVESTMENT REVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGERS REVIEW OUTLOOK Outlook Following the end of the financial year, market volatility has increased markedly, causing declines in most major equity markets at the time of writing.
Although the exact origins of market declines are always hard to pinpoint, the proximate causes in this case appear to be interest rate tightening by the Federal Reserve and a rise in long-dated US government debt above 3%, the first such occurrence in almost five years.

In addition, the portfolio contains attractive companies, the values of which we expect to continue growing over the long term.
Valuations remain attractive, with a weighted average portfolio discount of 30%.
The prospect of corporate events at the portfolio company level remains strong, driven in some cases by our own activism which will provide catalysts for discounts to narrow.
