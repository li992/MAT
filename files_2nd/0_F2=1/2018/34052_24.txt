Greenhouse gas emissions Our latest greenhouse gas GHG emissions report showed 2017 UK and European GHG emissions of 6,103.16 tonnes CO 2 equivalent tCO e an increase of 18% relative to 2016.
This increase is primarily due to increased business travel by air Scope 3.
2 2017 GHG emissions for Beazleys four principal North American offices are reported as 2,191.96 tCO e. This is 33% higher 2 than 2016 reported emissions and is due to the expansion of the scope of reporting for 2017.
2017 Scope 1 and 2 emissions 214.91 tCO e are 26% higher than those reported for 2016 also due to the expanded scope of reporting.
2 Beazleys GHG emission intensity ratio emissions employee year rose from 7.1 tCO e employee in 2016 to 7.7 tCO e employee 2 2 in 2017.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 77 Beazleys corporate GHG emissions are summarised in the table below: European offices North American offices 2016: 51.48 2016: data not available Scope 1 emissions 2017: 39.47 2017: data not available 2016: 886.83 2016: 170.21 Scope 2 emissions 2017: 683.63 2017: 214.91 2016: 4,235.00 2016: 1,483.74 Scope 3 emissions 2017: 5,380.06 2017: 1,977.05 2016: 5,173.31 2016: 1,653.95 Total 2017: 6,103.16 2017: 2,191.96 2016: 7.1 tCO e employee year 2 2017: 7.7 Notes: i Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated and presented in accordance with DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidelines, using the UK Governments GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting where possible.
ii Beazley Groups 2017 GHG emissions are, where possible, calculated using emission factors for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, reported in units of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tCO e. The principal exceptions to this are reporting of 2 emissions associated with electricity use in our Dublin and US offices, which are limited to just carbon dioxide CO. 2 iii Reporting is based on operational control.
Beazley Group does not have operational control over the building infrastructure and plant at its offices due to the presence of facility management companies and shared tenancy: as a result, emissions primarily fall within Scope 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
iv Reported Scope 1 sources are: company cars, fuel use in back-up generators and fugitive refrigerant losses from AC systems.
Emissions associated with electricity used in Beazleys offices and data centres are reported as Scope 2 emissions.
Scope 3 sources include business travel by air, rail, taxi and leased cars.
v UK and European office reporting covers activity associated with our principal UK office, Plantation Place South and our Dublin office.
These sites collectively accounted for 90% of Beazleys UK European permanent and contracted staff in 2017. vi Beazleys US office reporting covers activity associated with our three principal US offices, Farmington, New York and Chicago in 2015 and 2016.
The scope of reporting was expanded in 2017 to also include our Atlanta office.
These sites collectively accounted for 63% of Beazleys US employees in 2016 and 73% in 2017.
The scope of 2017 reporting is consistent with that for 2016.
Our 2017 scope of reporting has been expanded to include our Atlanta office: this takes US office coverage to 80% of employees based on 2016 occupancy.
