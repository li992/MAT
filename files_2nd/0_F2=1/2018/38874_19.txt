Persimmon Plc | Annual Report | December 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 73 SUMMARY OF THE 2012 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN The Groups 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan 2012 LTIP concluded in 2018 and was designed to align long term performance-related remuneration for the Groups senior management team with the strategy announced in February 2012.
Under the rules of the 2012 LTIP, 40% of the awards vested on 31 December 2017 the value of which was included in the 2017 Remuneration Report and the remaining 60% vested on 2 July 2018.
The 2012 LTIP concluded on 2 July 2018 with the second vesting.
A summary of the 2012 LTIP is set out below to give context to the second and final vesting of awards on 2 July 2018.

Details of the remuneration for 2018 is set out on pages 74 to 83 and the proposed implementation of the remuneration policy for 2019 is set out on pages 83 to 85.
The auditor is required to report on the following information up to and including the Statement of Directors shareholding requirements and share interests.
The figures set out in the table below are the actual amounts of salary or fees earned in the year to 31 December 2018.
The value of 2012LTIP awards vesting in 2017 and 2018 is the notional value of the proportion of the awards which vested on 31 December 2017 and2 July 2018 respectively, which are the figures we are required to publish.
The participants did not acquire their shares on these dates andtherefore these values cannot be deemed to be the values the participant will receive.
The actual value for income tax purposes is determined on the date the participant exercises their award, and the exercise date is at the choice of each individual participant and is until31 December 2022 at the latest for Dave Jenkinson and Mike Killoran and was 31 December 2018 for Jeff Fairburn.
In February 2018, the Executive Directors decided to reduce their entitlement to awards under the 2012 LTIP.
Details are set out onpage 73.
N icholas Wrigley resigned from the Board on 26 February 2018.
Nicholas was paid his salary and car allowance up to 28 February 2018.
The payment included 1,302.68 in respect of the period from 27-28 February 2018.
The value of 2012 LTIP awards which vested in 2017 have been restated for Jeff Fairburn to reflect the surrender of an award in February 2018 which had vested in part in December 2017.
T here is a salary sacrifice arrangement in place for the Companys defined benefit pension scheme.
As a result the actual salary paid to Dave Jenkinson, a member of the defined benefit pension scheme was reduced by 9% of his pensionable salary, which would have been the member rate of contribution to the scheme.
Marion Sears and Nigel Mills 2017 fees include additional Committee Chair fees Senior Independent fees from 14 December 2017.
Nigel Mills 2018 fees include additional fees for the period from 26 February 2018 to 31 May 2018 in which he was Acting Chairman.
2017 figures are from 3 April 2017, the date Simon Litherland was appointed to the Board.
Additional information on the amounts which make up the Single Total Figure of Remuneration is set out below.
Benefits Benefits include fully financed cars or cash car allowance, private medical scheme membership, life assurance benefits, income protection scheme membership, professional subscriptions, some legal advice and some telephone costs.
Notional annual bonus 2018 Taking into consideration the early vesting of awards under the 2012 LTIP, the Remuneration Committee determined that the Executive Directors would not receive an annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2018.
Although there is no annual bonus payable to the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee agreed with the Executive Directors request that the bonus still be measured and any amounts earned be distributed to the Groups employees who worked for the Group from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2017 excluding those employees who participated in the 2012 LTIP or participate in the 2017 Performance Share Plan 2017 PSP.
The notional bonus targets are set out below for information purposes only in order that shareholders can see the conditions that would have applied.
In particular, targets were made more stretching and strategic and personal metrics were introduced.
Persimmon Plc | Annual Report | December 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 75 Two financial and two non-financial metrics made up the performance condition for Executive Directors notional 2018 annual bonus.
The financial metrics were profit and cash generation measures, which each make up to 35% of maximum bonus potential.
These twofinancial measures are closely linked to the Groups long term strategy to deliver sustainable value and return surplus cash to shareholders under its Capital Return Plan, see page 43 and the Key Performance Indicators on pages 14 and 15.
The non-financial metrics were a customer care measure, which makes up to 15% of maximum bonus and is an important strategic objective for the Group, see page 12 and personal and strategic objectives which made up the remaining 15%.
The Remuneration Committee introduced an overriding discretion to not pay any part of an annual bonus if, acting fairly and reasonably it considers there have been failures in health and safety, risk or reputational standards.
The profit performance condition for the notional 2018 annual bonuses was again linked to the Groups profit before tax before exceptionals and goodwill impairment for the year the profit measure.
The cash generation performance condition did not change from the previous year and was the Group net cash inflow before Capital Return Plan and net land payments for the year the cash generation measure.
The Committee again included a customer care metric in the performance condition for the 2018 notional annual bonus.
Customer care remains an important strategic focus for the Board and the Committee considered that part of the Executive Directors notional annual bonus target should continue to be based on performance linked to that.
The measure chosen for 2018 was to achieve a minimum percentage of operating businesses rated as 4 star and above as measured by the results of the Home Builders Federation HBF Customer Satisfaction Survey question, Would you recommend Persimmon to a friend?.
This survey is an independent measure of customer satisfaction for houses legally completed from October 2017 to September 2018, measured from survey responses published up to 8 February 2019.
The strategic performance objectives related to key activities which were identified by the Board as reflecting the focus for management in people development, talent management and HR function planning.
The strategic objectives were set to recognise where the Group was on its development.
The Remuneration Committee considered that progress had been made but that the strategic objectives had not been met in full and therefore, in aggregate, this part of the condition would contribute 9% of a maximum 15% of notional bonus.
The target figures set for each part of the performance condition and the extent to which they were achieved are set out below.
There is straight line vesting between threshold, target and maximum.

Persimmon Plc | Annual Report | December 2018 76 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued Long Term Incentive Plan awards vesting in 2018 Awards granted under the 2012 LTIP had a performance condition based upon the return of 6.20 per share to shareholders under the Groups Capital Return Plan.
Under the rules of the 2012 LTIP, 40% of the awards vested on 31 December 2017 as the Group had made returns to shareholders of 4.85 per share, equal to 1.5bn.
Further Capital Return Plan payments of 125p per share and 110p per share were paid to shareholders on 29 March 2018 and 2 July 2018, respectively and the performance condition was met in full on 2 July 2018.
In February 2018, the Executive Directors informed the Remuneration Committee of a series of decisions intended to reduce the scale of payments and extend the holding period under the second tranche.
Details are provided on page 73.
The regulatory value of the proportion of the awards that vested on 2 July 2018 after the reduction described on page 73 is set out below and this information is required to be included in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table.
This is a notional value and cannot be deemed to be the value the participant will actually receive when they exercise their award and acquire the shares.
Details of awards actually exercised by the Executive Directors during the year are provided in the table on page 79.
The return of 6.20 per share to shareholders had to be achieved by the Measurement Dates set out below.
Cumulative Cash Return targets Measurement Dates Achieved 1.70 per share or more by 31 December 2015 P 2.80 per share or more by 31 December 2017 P 3.90 per share or more by 31 December 2019 P 5.05 per share or more by 31 December 2020 P 6.20 per share or more by 31 December 2021 P The initial exercise price of an option was reduced by an amount equal to the value of cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during the period from date of grant to the earlier of 31 December 2021 or the date of exercise of an option.
The total number of shares held under an option that could vest was determined by reference to the fraction x 6.20, where x is the value of the Cumulative Cash Returns paid by the relevant Measurement Date.
All options have therefore vested in full.
Persimmon Plc | Annual Report | December 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 77 In considering the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied, no options were capable of vesting and becoming exercisable unless, in the opinion of the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, the cash returns paid by the Company were financed outof retained earnings and the Company had an ungeared balance sheet at the relevant Measurement Date, except to take account of events and or circumstances which the Committee fairly and reasonably determines are appropriate the Underpin.
The Remuneration Committee has confirmed that 6.20 per share has been returned by the Group within the Underpin and therefore the Performance Condition was met by 2 July 2018.
In alignment with the capital discipline at the core of the Groups long term strategy, on 26 February 2018 the Board determined to net settle the 40% of options granted under the 2012 LTIP that vested on 31 December 2017.
The Board subsequently decided to also net settle the second tranche of awards which vested on 2 July 2018.
Participants sacrifice their interest in an appropriate number of shares issued in exchange for an equivalently valued cash payment being sufficient to allow the participants to meet their income tax and employee national insurance liabilities in respect of the exercise of their vested options.
The value of these liabilities is determined by the Companys share price on the date participants choose to exercise their options together with the prevailing income tax and national insurance contribution rates at that time, see note 29.
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE Scheme is an HMRC approved all employee savings related share option scheme.
Invitations are issued annually to all employees to apply for the grant of an option under the SAYE.

Mike Killorans scheme retirement age is 60 and Jeff Fairburns is 65.
Mike Killoran was paid a salary supplement of 30% of his base salary during 2018, which the Committee after taking advice considered was cost neutral to the Company based on the pension benefits Mike Killoran previously earned.
Mike Killoran decided to reduce his pension salary supplement to 9% with effect from 1 March 2019.
Jeff Fairburn received a salary supplement of 24% of his base salary.
No additional benefits are receivable by the Directors on early retirement.

There were no other payments for loss ofoffice in 2018.
Jeff Fairburns Settlement Agreement As previously announced Jeff Fairburns employment with the Company ended on 31 December 2018 and details of the terms of the Settlement Agreement agreed by Jeff Fairburn and the Company on 6 November 2018 are set out below.
The Company agreed with Jeff to reduce his 12 month notice period and therefore no further payments of salary or provision of benefits including pension were made to Jeff after 31 December 2018.
Jeff also had no bonus entitlement for 2018.
The Company agreed to contribute up to 10,000 plus VAT but inclusive of any disbursements towards the reasonable legal fees incurred by Jeff in obtaining advice exclusively in respect of the termination of his employment.
As set out above, 9,450 including VAT was paid for his legal fees.
In respect of outstanding share awards the Company agreed the following: 2012 LTIP The arrangements in relation to Jeffs entitlement under the 2012 LTIP satisfied his contractual entitlement: the Remuneration Committee did not exercise any discretion in his favour.
Following the surrender of options announced on 23 February 2018, the second and final vest of all remaining options to all participants in the 2012 LTIP occurred in full on 2 July 2018.
The extension of the holding period applying to 50% of Jeffs remaining second vest shares after payment of tax included a requirement that Jeff not resign from employment with Persimmon and these shares were voluntarily pledged by Jeff as security against his commitment to stay with the business the restricted shares.
Whilst the Company sought to mitigate the entitlement falling due to Jeff, as the Company asked Jeff to leave, legal advice confirmed that the Company did not have any discretion to withhold or seek forfeiture over any of the restricted 2012 LTIP shares, although these continue to be required to be held until 6 July 2021.
Jeff was entitled to exercise all of his options under the 2012 LTIP which remained outstanding following the surrender of options announced on 23 February 2018.
Any such exercise had to take place no later than 31 December 2018.
Jeff exercised his remaining awards under the 2012 LTIP on 6 December 2018.
Bonus share scheme Jeffs deferred bonus share scheme awards granted under the Companys annual bonus plan in respect of bonuses earned in 2016 and 2017 automatically lapsed in full on 31 December 2018, as a result of his leaving at the Companys request.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE Jeffs unvested SAYE options also lapsed on 31 December 2018.
Payments to past Directors There were no payments to past Directors for the year ended 31 December 2018 where the total payment to the former Director exceeded a threshold set by the Company of 60,000.
Service contracts The Executive Directors have service contracts with a 12 month notice period.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not employees, they have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities: they do not have service contracts.
A Non-Executives appointment is initially for a three-year term, subject to re-election at each AGM but their appointment may be terminated on one months notice.
There are no change of control provisions in the Executive Directors service contracts.
The rules of the Companys share schemes provide for early exercise of awards on a takeover or change of control.
Where an option price was payable, instead of requiring the participant to pay the option price, he received a number of shares which had an aggregate market value equivalent to the notional gain i. e. the amount by which the aggregate market value of the number of Shares in respect of which the award was exercised exceeded the aggregate option price of that number of Shares.
All of the above represent share options and were granted for no financial consideration.

Persimmon Plc | Annual Report | December 2018 82 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued Group Chief Executive change in remuneration Set out below is a comparison of the change in remuneration of the Group Chief Executive from 2017 to 2018, compared to the change in remuneration of the Groups salaried employees.
The salaried employees have been selected as the most suitable comparator group as this includes junior to senior employees with the most relevant pay structure.
Percentage change from 2017 to 2018 Annual salary Bonus Value of taxable benefits Group Chief Executive 0% No bonus payable for 2018 18.7% Average of salaried employees 5.8% -0.2% -3.6% Salaried staff generally received a 3% salary increase in 2018, however there were a number of promotional increases during the year.
Bonus for employees is the amount paid in the year.
The average bonus per salaried employee fell slightly over the year due to the dilution effect of the increased number of more junior employees and trainees, recruited to support the growth of the business.
These junior employees generally receive a lower percentage bonus than other employees.
Statement of voting at General Meeting The Directors Remuneration Policy, effective from 27 April 2017 and the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2017 were put to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM and 2018 AGM respectively.
In the case of the 2017 AGM resolutions were passed on a show of hands and at the 2018 AGM voting was conducted on a poll.
The table below summarises the proxy votes lodged for the Directors Remuneration Policy and the result of the poll vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2017.

Although the Executive Directors made significant reductions and adjustments to their 2012 LTIP awards a scheme that was approved by shareholders in 2012 a sizeable number of shareholders remained concerned over the level of remuneration that ultimately resulted from the vesting of these 2012 awards.
As set out earlier in this report, for 2018, in addition to the reduction and amendments the Executive Directors made to their 2012 LTIP awards in February 2018, the Executive Directors did not receive an increase to their salaries in 2018, were not entitled to an annual bonus for 2018 and did not receive an award under the 2017 PSP.
The Remuneration Committee endorsed the Executives request that an amount equivalent to the bonuses which they would have earned be distributed to staff excluding those who participated in the 2012 LTIP and 2017 PSP.
Since his appointment to the Board on 1 June 2018 the new Chairman, Roger Devlin has met with the Companys major shareholders to discuss any views held by those shareholders, including on future remuneration.
Due to the continuing impact of the quantum of the 2012 LTIP awards on Persimmons reputation and consequently on Jeff Fairburns ability to continue in his role, the Board asked Jeff Fairburn to leave the Company on 31 December 2018 and the terms of his Settlement Agreement are set out on page 78.
The Remuneration Committee has listened to shareholders views that restraint should be exercised.
During 2018 the Committee amended the bonus structure, re-evaluated the metrics for the 2017 PSP and completed preparations for the implementation of the FRCs new UK Corporate Governance Code which took effect on 1 January 2019.
Our future remuneration will be clearly in line with best practice.

Remuneration policy implementation for 2019 As set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement to shareholders on pages 71 and 72, the Committee intends for future remuneration to be clearly in line with best practice.
Dave Jenkinson has agreed that there will be no change to his remuneration upon his appointment as Group Chief Executive.
His remuneration did not change when he was appointed Interim Group Chief Executive.
All annual bonus and PSP awards which will be made in the future include discretion to reduce any formulaic out-turns plus updated malus and clawback provisions.
Details of the remuneration for the Executive Directors is set out below: Executive Directors Base salaries The Remuneration Committee has determined that the Executive Directors will not receive an increase to their base salary for 2019.
Base salary Percentage from 1 January increase from 2019 2018 Dave Jenkinson 515,000 Nil Mike Killoran 511,775 Nil Annual bonus Taking into consideration the early vesting of awards under the 2012 LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has again determined that the Executive Directors will not receive an annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2019.
Although there will be no annual bonus, the Remuneration Committee has set performance targets in the normal way.
The performance targets for 2019 will be 70% financial and 30% non-financial, and the non-financial element will be split equally between a customer care measure and a build quality measure.
The financial targets will be profit before tax and cash generation.
The targets for customer care and quality will be a fraction of those operating businesses rated as 85% or above as measured by the Home Builders Federation survey.
The financial targets are based on figures which are commercially sensitive, but they will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
Pension and Pension Salary Supplement Basic salary is the only component of pay which is pensionable.
Executive Directors are offered the same pension benefits as the salaried employees, who make up the majority of the Groups employees, except that the level of salary supplement payable to the existing Executive Directors has been higher than that offered to salaried employees, see page 77.
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its salaried employees the defined benefit pension scheme closed to new members in 2001.
Contributions to the defined contribution scheme are matched up to 9% of basic salary.
Salary supplements available to the salaried workforce for employees who opt out of pension accrual due to pension tax allowance issues are a maximum of 9% of basic salary.
Mike Killoran has decided to reduce his pension salary supplement from 30% to 9% of basic salary with effect from 1 March 2019.
Dave Jenkinsons salary supplement will remain at 24% of basic salary for the time being but will be reduced in line with the supplement available to salaried employees when a new remuneration package is implemented in January 2020.
The Remuneration Policy approved in 2017 states that any Executive Director appointed externally after the date of the Policy will be awarded a pension or cash contribution in line with the maximum payable to the salaried workforce.
Persimmon Plc | Annual Report | December 2018 84 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued 2017 PSP Awards The Remuneration Committee has determined that the Executive Directors will not receive Performance Share Plan awards in 2019.
Share Retention Policy The Committee has reviewed the Executive Directors share retention policy following publication of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018.
The new shareholding requirements are set out below and include a post cessation requirement.
Shareholding Requirement Post Cessation Shareholding Requirement Executive Directors 5 x salary At least 100% of their requirement on departure or actual holding on 4 x salary for new departure if lower for two years external appointments following departure The Executive Directors are currently required to hold shares in the Company to a value of two times their basic salary.
As noted on page 80 both Executive Directors currently have shareholdings in excess of these requirements.
In addition, certain shares they acquire under the 2012 LTIP, must be retained for a minimum of 12 months from the date of exercise or until 6 July 2021 for Mike Killorans restricted shares, whichever is the later, see table on page 80.
The post cessation shareholding requirement will be introduced through making it a condition that shares acquired under future bonus share scheme or 2017 PSP awards be placed in a nominee account prior to departure.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees Roger Devlin was appointed to the Board on 1 June 2018 and his fee on appointment was 300,000 p. a.
The Committee has agreed that the Chairmans fee will not increase for 2019.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Board has agreed that the Non-Executives fees will not increase for 2019.

In particular, the Committee considered the new requirements to set remuneration for the layer of management just below board and improved procedures for taking remuneration policies and practices across the Group into account when setting the policy for Executive Director remuneration.
The Committee sought advice during the year on remuneration matters for the Executive Directors, including the terms of Jeff Fairburns remuneration on leaving the Group, the Chairmans fee and the pay for the Below Board Pay Group from Deloitte LLP, its independent remuneration consultants.
Deloitte were appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2016 and were selected due to their expertise in executive remuneration.
The Committee considers that the advice provided by Deloitte as professional remuneration consultants is objective and independent.
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Deloitte also provided advice to the Company on net settling the awards under the 2012 LTIP and on a new all employee share scheme.
The Committee was previously advised by New Bridge Street, an Aon company on the introduction of the 2012 LTIP.
The amount of fees the Company paid to Deloitte for the services they provided to the Remuneration Committee in 2018 was 62,418, charged on a time spent basis.
The Remuneration Committee also sought advice during 2018 from Ashurst LLP, an international law firm, regarding the vesting of awards under the 2012 LTIP and the Committees rights thereunder with respect to the level of awards that vested, advice that materially assisted the Committee with respect to such vesting.
The amount of fees paid to Ashurst LLP for the provision of that advice, which was charged on a time spent basis, was 72,776.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Ashurst LLP, selected because they have acted as the Companys solicitors and being regulated by the Law Society of England and Wales, is objective and independent.
Ashurst LLP also provided legal advice to the Company with respect to a range of matters, including day to day legal matters, the Annual General Meeting of the Company, compliance with legal and regulatory obligations, including under the Market Abuse Regulation and the extension of the Companys revolving credit facilities.
