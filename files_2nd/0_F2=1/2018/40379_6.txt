Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Against the background of a slowly growing economy, and with household incomes remaining under pressure, our value-based consumer proposition and the part-time income opportunity we offer remain extremely attractive to both Members and Partners respectively.
Our continuing organic growth is underpinned by high levels of confidence amongst our Partners in our brand and financial strength, the good value we provide through our fair pricing policies, and our commitment to delivering best-in-class service and support to our Members.
Members MEMBERS 2018 2017 Residential Club 583,273 578,799 Business Club 27,466 29,003 TOTAL CLUB 610,739 607,802 Whilst we continue to regard our business Club as an exciting long-term opportunity, the dynamics of this market make it extremely difficult to grow in the current energy wholesale pricing environment.
The current focus is therefore firmly on our residential Club, where there is a significant difference in average expected customer lifetimes between Members and therefore in the revenues and profits they will generate depending on whether they are an owner-occupier, and on the number of services we are providing to them.
The most attractive category are owner-occupiers taking our Double Gold bundle.
Our focus and success in attracting this type of Member has been reflected in the consistently high proportion of new Members gathered by Partners who switch all their services to us landline, broadband, mobile, electricity and or gas as can be seen from the following figures: PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEMBERS TAKING DOUBLE GOLD BUNDLE Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 15 Q1 FY17 51.5% Q2 FY17 44.7% Q3 FY17 46.6% Q4 FY17 55.1% Q1 FY18 50.9% Q2 FY18 48.3% Q3 FY18 48.6% Q4 FY18 53.2% CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED It is extremely encouraging that since the year-end, this proportion has further increased to a record level of over 56%, taking the proportion of our total membership base who are taking all our services to over 23.5% at the end of May.
We were encouraged to see our energy supply point churn fall marginally to around 1.1% per month, against a background of record levels of switching within the energy industry generally, and the continuing large gap between the introductory fixed price deals available from other suppliers and the range of tariffs we offer: OUR ENERGY SUPPLY POINT CHURN 16 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 FY11 16.3% FY12 13.3% FY13 11.2% FY14 10.4% FY15 11.2% FY16 13.1% FY17 13.2% FY18 12.7% Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Average revenue per Member increased due to a combination of rising energy prices and the benefit from the higher penetration of communications services particularly mobile within our membership: AVERAGE REVENUE PER MEMBER These revenue figures relate solely to our Customer Management operating segment, the figures for 2008 to 2014 inclusive are restated as detailed in the 2015 Annual Report Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 17 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 190 286 316 329 459 482 505 634 801 819 1,064 1,149 1,137 1,186 1,359 1,304 1,279 1,226 1,191 1,267 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Services The full range of services we offer includes landline telephony calls and line rental, broadband, mobile, gas, electricity, home insurance, and our CashBack card.
At the year end, we supplied a total of 2,340,719 services to Club Members 2017: 2,288,918, an increase of 2.3% during the year.
This reflects our strategic decision to place mobile at the heart of our retail proposition, progressively improving its competitive position as we obtain better wholesale terms ourselves from EE: enhancements over the last 18 months have included the introduction of 4G data, launching new tariffs with significantly larger data allowances, much lower global roaming rates, and reductions to our out-of-bundle charges.
And from 1st July, were adding Switzerland to our list of roam-like-home destinations.
CashBack Our exclusive CashBack card has proven an attractive and important Member acquisition and retention tool, and is one of the key factors behind our continuing organic growth and low churn against a challenging market background.
It has historically given our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as an automatic credit on their next monthly bill from us.
Since launching the programme, the total value of CashBack funded by participating retailers and credited to Members now exceeds 38m 2017: 33m.
We believe the continuing strong demand for this card clearly demonstrates the attractiveness of this unique membership benefit, and contributes towards our consistently high levels of customer retention.
18 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements To broaden its appeal, we announced at our sales conference in March 2018 that we would shortly be launching an enhanced CashBack card, which provides 1% CashBack on everyday household shopping at non-participating retailers on up to 1,000 of retail spend each month in addition to the 3%-7% at participating retailers.
Since this announcement, the proportion of new members signed up by Partners who request a CashBack card has increased.
Historically, the CashBack that we pay to our Members each month has been funded entirely by the participating retailers, with many Members achieving a reduction of 20% to 30% on the net cost of their utilities simply by using their CashBack card instead of an alternative payment card for most of their regular household shopping.
Where customers are using our enhanced new card, the 1% CashBack on their general household spend will largely be funded by us, but the cost of this is expected to be largely offset by the combination of the 2 monthly fee, an increase in the number of new Members, and lower churn.
As well as any savings from using their CashBack cards, many Members also use our online shopping portal to reduce their bills: this generated around 0.5m of additional CashBack for our Members over the course of last year.
Member Service and Support We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single support centre based in the UK, and ensuring where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues they may have with their multi-utility account.
We are clearly focussed on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members, willingly investing in technology designed to achieve this objective, and continually assessing the numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects of our Members interactions with us to improve the overall quality of their experience.
We have been delighted at the consistently high ratings, awards and recognition we receive from Moneywise and Which?
for the quality of the service and support provided to our Members, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys.
We were particularly proud to be recognised as the UKs Best Utilities Provider at the Which?
2018 Awards a few weeks ago, a massive endorsement of our commitment to looking after our customers, and treating them as we would wish to be treated ourselves, from the UKs leading independent consumer champion.
Partners Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business.
In contrast to the routes to market adopted by other suppliers of similar household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenuesharing model and the structure of our compensation plan, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy higher-spending Members who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be least likely to churn: by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income.
This ensures that cases of mis-selling are both inadvertent and extremely rare.
Our Partners are also extremely effective at targeting high quality customers who would not otherwise be engaged in the market, and in communicating the savings, simplicity and service provided by our unique integrated multi-utility proposition together with all the other benefits of being part of our discount club to prospective new Members.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 19 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED We provide a variety of training and personal development courses, both online and classroom-based, designed to provide them with the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners effectively and successfully.
In addition, we offer a low-cost hire purchase scheme which gives Partners access to a Tablet so they can present the benefits of our unique Discount Club more effectively.
For any Partner who wants to spend a substantial amount of time developing their Utility Warehouse business, we operate a Quick Income Plan: this gives them the opportunity to accelerate some of their residual income and thus potentially replace their previous main source of income.
This recent initiative has been well received, and is transforming the way increasing numbers of potential new recruits are looking at this opportunity.
Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with the opportunity to purchase a Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini or in some cases a BMW X5, remains extremely popular, as demonstrated by the delivery of our 1000th Mini 2017: c. 900 a few weeks ago.
Owners inform us that they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from both potential new Members and Partners.
Smart Meter roll-out By the end of the financial year our rollout programme has resulted in an installed base of over 207,000 smart meters, representing 21.6% of our domestic energy customer portfolio: whilst less than we were forecasting due to the ongoing failure of our MOP partners to meet their agreed targets, the proportion of our base who now have a smart meter is now slightly ahead of the average for the industry as a whole.
The transition from first generation SMETS1 smart meters to second generation SMETS2 smart meters has repeatedly been pushed back, and is now scheduled to start sometime this winter: considerable scepticism exists within the industry on the achievability of this new target.
In addition to much-debated efficiency benefits, smart meters have the potential to materially improve the relationship between customers and energy suppliers.
We remain broadly supportive of the nationwide smart meter programme, albeit we are concerned over the significant additional costs that are being incurred as a result of an ill-conceived and sub-optimum rollout strategy co combined with unrealistic deadlines a cost that will ultimately be met by consumers.
IT Systems The journey we embarked on in 2016 to start reviewing the systems and processes which have evolved over the course of the last 20 years, and to prepare for the introduction of new services, is gathering steam.
And while this is creating significant additional costs in the short term, with benefits that may take many years to arrive, I am confident that making this investment is the right decision for the business.
In the meantime, our operating costs remain lower than those of any of our peers on a like-for-like basis, and we look forward to the operating efficiencies and performance improvements which our new systems are expected to deliver in due course.
