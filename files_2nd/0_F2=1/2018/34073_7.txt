Under the new Remuneration Policy with effect from 1 May 2017, A W Pidgley is no longer eligible to earn new contributions under the Bonus Plan.

In accordance with the old Remuneration Policy, in 2016 17 the Company disclosed 50% of the contribution into the Bonus Plan for the level of performance achieved in the financial year because of the ongoing risk of performance based forfeiture of the deferred amount.
Following consultation with shareholders on the new Policy and to provide greater transparency on what is actually earned in respect of the year 100% of the contribution is now disclosed under the new Policy.
The impact of the treatment under the old Remuneration Policy of bonus was that when the risk of performance based forfeiture was removed on the deferred amount it was disclosed in the single figure table as a multi-year incentive along with any vesting element of the 2011 LTIP.
Under the new Policy because 100% of the contribution into the Bonus Plan for the level of performance achieved in the financial year is disclosed in respect of that year there will be no elements of deferred bonus disclosed as multi-year awards.
