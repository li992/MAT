Adjusted profitability measures are presented excluding exceptional and non-underlying items as we believe this provides both management and investors with useful additional information about the Groups performance and aids a more effective comparison of the Groups trading performance between one period and the next.
Adjusted profitability measures are reconciled to unadjusted IFRS results on the face of the income statement with details of exceptional and non-underlying items provided in note 4.
In addition, the Groups results are described using certain other measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore considered to be APMs.
These measures are used by management to monitor ongoing business performance against both shorter-term budgets and forecasts and the Groups longer-term strategic plans.
