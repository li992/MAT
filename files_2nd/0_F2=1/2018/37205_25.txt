124 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 5: Other notes NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER 5.1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PREPARATION The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRS IC Interpretations IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivatives that have been measured at fair value.
After reviewing the Groups current plans and forecasts and financing arrangements, as well as the current trading activities of the Group, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for a period of at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
In the current reporting period, the Group has adopted the following new standards: Endorsed by the EU Summary Impact of adoption IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Replacement project on financial instruments consisting of three phases: No changes to accounting treatment or disclosures resulted.
Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities: Phase 2: Impairment methodology: and Phase 3: Hedge accounting IFRS 15 Revenue from Established a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting No changes to accounting treatment.
Contracts with Customers for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
It supersedes the Additional disclosures have been previous revenue standard IAS 18 Revenue made in Note 1.1, 3.6 and 3.9.
In respect of IFRS 9, the Group holds instruments such as derivatives and noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds NCIs at fair value, the former held for trading and the latter designated at FVTPL.
Under the new standard, derivatives will continue to be held for trading and therefore at FVTPL.
Similarly, the option to designate an instrument at FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch has been carried over into IFRS 9.
In the case of NCIs, the liability at fair value matches the assets of the fund, which are required to be held at fair value if equities or derivatives or which we elect to hold at fair value if they are hedged debt instruments.
Trade and other receivables and payables principally comprise shortterm settlement accounts and accruals, neither of which are held for trading or meet the definition of items that could be carried at fair value.
Such instruments therefore remain at amortised cost.
In terms of impairment, the majority of Jupiters revenue comes from management fees due from the funds for which we provide management services.
These are paid to the Group monthly, a few days in advance of the month end.
Therefore, at each month end, receivables are low as we have already collected amounts due from the majority of our clients.
Typically, receivables comprise unpaid sales contracts and expropriations together, settlement accounts, which are receivables in transit between funds and end clients and which are required to be settled within four days.
Other trade debtors comprise amounts due from institutional clients.
Cash collateral is paid over by the Group to satisfy counterparty requirements in respect of open derivative positions.
It is very unusual for Jupiter to suffer any impairment in respect of trade receivables: unpaid settlements do not result in losses, but instead oblige the Group to purchase units in funds which are then subject to market risk until they can be sold.
Institutional debtors rarely default, given that the Group manages assets worth many multiples of any outstanding fees on behalf of those clients, although it should be noted that the Group is not generally permitted to remove cash from managed segregated mandates in order to receive settlement.
Cash held with banks or held by other companies as collateral could be at risk should the financial institutions holding it fail.
We have not experienced and do not expect to experience credit losses arising from these counterparties.
In the Groups consideration of the impact of IFRS 15 on its financial statements, we have employed the five step model to determine the timing and quantification of revenue.
Our implementation included the identification of all material revenue sources, including management and performance fees, upfront fees and also upfront revenue-related costs.
We undertook a review of customer contracts to determine our performance obligation and the associated recognition timing.
The Groups accounting policies under IAS 18 Revenue were aligned with the requirements of IFRS 15 in respect of these revenue sources, thus the adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any significant impact to the Group.
The additional disclosures required under IFRS 15 have been made in Note 1.1, 3.6 and 3.9.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 include the consolidated financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The accounting policies set out those policies that have been applied consistently in preparing the Group financial statements.
No new policies have been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed later in this note within the section Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions.
com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 125 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION I SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity if the Group has all of the following: power over the investee: exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Groups subsidiaries comprise operating and holding companies, and those funds where the Group acts as fund manager which are consolidated as a result of additional exposure to the variable returns of the funds through seed investment.
Where we own 100% of an operating or holding company, our judgement is that the above elements of control are immediately satisfied and that the companies are therefore subsidiaries of the Group.
Seed investments are accounted for as subsidiaries, associates or other financial investments depending on the holdings of the Group and on the level of influence and control that the Group is judged to have.
SIGNIFICANT AREA OF JUDGEMENT In determining the level of control for seed investments, additional judgement is required.
The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, and voting rights and potential voting rights.
Exposure to variable returns is usually determined by the earning of management fees, and the percentage investment in the funds net assets.
Where the value of the Groups holding exceeds 50% of the total value of the fund, the Group deems control to automatically exist.
Where ownership is under 50%, the Group applies a rebuttable presumption that interests amounting to 30% or more are consolidated, subject to review of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment relevant to establishing whether the Group is acting as principal or agent to the fund.
These include the potential for large performance fees to be earned, an assessment of kick-out rights and the existence of any other large investors in the fund.
Kick-out rights rarely vary between the different types of funds that the Group manages, the percentage investment in a fund is therefore the primary means for determining whether control exists for the Group, and the determination of the threshold to be used as the rebuttable presumption is a key area of judgement for the Group.
This judgement determines the extent to which the Groups balance sheet is grossed up to reflect additional financial instruments under the Groups control and, as the value of such instruments is material to the Group, this has been included as a significant area of judgement in Note 5.1.
The Group has seed investments in both its unit trusts and its SICAV sub-funds.
The Groups judgement is that control can exist in a subfund, even if it does not exist in the whole of the umbrella fund, as the sub-funds have no cross-liability risk to other sub-funds or to the SICAV umbrella fund and thus should be accounted for as separate entities.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts or circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
A list of subsidiaries, split into operating and holding companies and consolidated funds, is provided in Note 6.3.
Consistent accounting policies are applied across all Group companies.
Intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The transactions and balances of subsidiaries are consolidated in these financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where external investors hold shares in funds controlled by the Group, the portion of profit or loss and net assets held by these noncontrolling interests is included within other gains losses in the consolidated income statement and as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated balance sheet respectively.
II ASSOCIATES Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control.
Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence where it has voting rights of 20% or more, but not control of the investee.
Seed investments over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, are carried in the balance sheet at fair value as permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The fair value of investments in associates is determined by reference to the quoted price or net asset value of the funds at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The Group has no other investments in associates and, therefore, no associates are currently accounted for using the equity method.
FOREIGN CURRENCY I FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATIONAL CURRENCY Items included in the financial information of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is both the Companys functional and presentational currency as well as the currency in which the majority of the Groups revenue streams, assets and liabilities are denominated.

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued II TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at yearend exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
Translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of other gains losses.
III GROUP COMPANIES The assets and liabilities of Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date, with income and expenses translated at average exchange rates.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income and are recycled to the income statement on disposal or liquidation of the relevant branch or subsidiary.
NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED The International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS IC have issued a number of new accounting standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations.
The following new standard, which has been endorsed by the EU, is not applicable to these financial statements, but is expected to have an impact when it becomes effective.
The Group plans to apply this standard in the reporting period in which it becomes effective.
Summary Effective for periods beginning on or after IFRS 16 Leases Provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise 1 January 2019 assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
It will supersede the current guidance found in IAS 17 Leases There are no other IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
There are transition options available on adoption of the standard.
The Group has elected to apply this standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application in accordance with paragraphs C7-C13 of the standard.
This option accounts for leases as if the Group had always applied IFRS 16.
The Group expects the adoption of IFRS 16 to increase the Groups total assets by 53.2m and liabilities by 55.6m as a result of the requirement to capitalise both the right to use leased assets and the contractual payments to be made under lease obligations.
The liability is calculated using an appropriate discount rate for the Group and the nature of its leased assets.
As a result, the income statement charge for lease payments is expected to be larger in the earlier years of a lease, and smaller in the later years.
The 2018 charge of 4.7m see Note 1.3 is based on broadly the same leased assets.
In addition, the 2019 rental charge, previously recognised as a single administrative charge within the income statement, will be split into a depreciation charge relating to the capitalised asset within administrative expenses and a finance cost representing the unwinding of the discount.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, JUDGEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial information, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions are modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
Estimates are further categorised into the following categories: i Those estimates where there is a reasonable level of risk which could lead to a material change within the next financial year: and ii Those areas where the use of estimation is important, but where the risk of material adjustment is not significant.
The areas where judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty are significant to the Group financial statements are discussed in the following notes: 1.5 Share-based payments area of estimation, category ii 3.1 Impairment of goodwill area of estimation, category ii 5.1 Consolidation of seed investments area of judgement www.

The Group used the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques, for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Certain holdings in debt securities had previously been designated as being level 1.
However, these should have been assigned to level 2 as, despite the existence of a liquid market in which these instruments can be traded, the securities are unlisted and their values are derived from quotes supplied by brokers.
LEVEL 1 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTPL These relate to non-consolidated seed investments and hedges of awards in fund units in mutual funds.
It also includes the underlying holdings in consolidated funds that meet the definition of level 1 financial instruments.
Details are included in Note 5.4.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FVTPL These relate to noncontrolling interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
LEVEL 2 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of financial instruments are valued based on observable market data from readily-available external sources.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTPL These relate to underlying holdings in consolidated funds that meet the definition of level 2 financial instruments.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the price to exit the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value are included in the income statement.
The Group enters into swap arrangements and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain of its seed investments.
Gains and losses arising from fair value movements in the swap and forward contracts are recognised in the consolidated income statement within other gains losses and are settled periodically, in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Any cash settlements due from or to the counterparty in relation to the swap arrangements, which are required to be settled at the end of each month, are recorded within current assets or current liabilities as trade receivables or other payables, as appropriate.
The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts, which are required to be settled at periods other than month end, are recorded within financial assets or liabilities at FVTPL, as appropriate.
At 31 December 2018, the notional value of the swaps was 47.4m 2017: 40.3m and the foreign exchange forward contracts was 91.3m 2017: 75.6m.
The settlement amount of the swaps at 31 December 2018 was a receivable of 3.3m 2017: 1.4m which is included within trade and other receivables.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Group is subject to a number of financial risks throughout its business, the principal risks being market risk including price, foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board is accountable for risk and is responsible for oversight of the risk management process.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the risk strategy of the Group, and for determining an appropriate risk appetite and tolerance levels within which the Group must operate.
By defining these, the Board demonstrates that it is aware of and, where appropriate, has taken steps to mitigate the impact of risks that may have a material impact on the Group.
The Executive Committee reviews the key corporate risks facing the Group.
The Chief Executive Officer has ultimate responsibility for the governance of the risk management of the firm, but delegates the risk and control framework to the Chief Risk Officer, who has responsibility for the monitoring and reporting of risk and controls, and through the Risk and Finance Committee manages the ongoing development of the Groups risk and control framework.
Jupiter embeds risk management within the business, with independent oversight and challenge being provided by the risk function.
PRICE RISK Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets will adversely impact the profitability of the Group.
Management has identified price risk as the exposure to unfavourable movements in the value of financial assets held by the Group which would result in a loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The Group holds listed equity investments in its seed investments portfolio which are exposed to the risk of changes in equity markets.
At 31 December 2018, the fair value, and therefore maximum exposure to listed securities, was 138.4m 2017: 96.6m.
The Groups policy is to hedge the equity market and currency exposure of its seed investments depending on the fund mandate and whether available transactions are cost effective.
As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the Group held swap instruments to act as hedges against risk exposures arising from certain holdings in seed fund investments.
PRICE RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON FINANCIAL ASSETS The Directors believe that 10% gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to price risk.
An increase or decrease of 10% in equity markets would have the impact shown below on the Groups profit before taxation.
This reflects estimated gains and losses on the Groups listed investments at the balance sheet date and not any likely impact on the Groups revenue or costs.
There is no further impact on the Groups equity.
2018 2017 Impact on the income statement of change in equity markets m m 10% 9.1 5.6 10% 9.1 5.6 The analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into to hedge against such movements.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
The Group predominantly operates in the UK, with some transactions from overseas third parties in foreign currencies, which create exposure to nonsterling income and expenses.
The Groups policy is to hold the minimum amount of foreign currency required to cover operational needs and to convert foreign currency on receipt.
Direct exposures are limited to operational cash held in overseas subsidiaries, short term outstanding foreign currency fee debtors and investments in seed denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group does not normally hedge these exposures, other than in the case of certain seed investments, which are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts.
These contracts are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk is monitored closely and managed by the finance function.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Directors believe that 10% gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax.
This reflects estimated gains and losses on retranslating the Groups foreign currency assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and not any likely impact on the Groups revenue or costs.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk arises principally through operational cash balances held in foreign currencies and seed investments held in nonSterling share classes.

com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 131 INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Groups cash balances Note 3.7.
The Group manages interest rate risk via the finance function monitoring of the interest rate cash flow risks and returns.
The Group puts cash on deposit at fixed rates of interest for periods of up to three months.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Directors believe that a movement in interest rates of 50bps gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to interest rate risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax mainly through the impact on floating rate cash deposits.
2018 2017 Impact on the income statement of change in interest rates m m 50 bps 0.9 1.2 50 bps 0.1 0.4 CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to a financial loss in the Groups operating activities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily from its treasury activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, but also from its trade receivables and, in certain circumstances, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade receivables are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss expose the Group to credit risk where seed investments in funds are consolidated and those funds hold investments in debt instruments or derivative positions with a positive fair value.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is 370.4m 2017: 390.4m, represented by the carrying value of its nonequity financial assets at FVTPL 100.8m 2017: 50.5m, trade receivables 67.9m 2017: 105.7m and cash and cash equivalents 201.7m 2017: 234.2m.
The fair values of the Groups financial liabilities at FVTPL are not affected by changes in the Groups credit risk.
There is no difference between the carrying amount of financial liabilities at FVTPL and the amount the Group would be contractually required to pay at maturity.
With regard to credit risk related to financial instruments, the Groups policy is to place deposits only with financial institutions which satisfy minimum ratings and other criteria set by the Counterparty Review Group CRG.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and thereby mitigate the possibility of financial loss through counterparty failure.
The CRG monitors the Groups counterparty exposures.

Investments in associates comprise equity investments which are not rated.
Trade and other receivables which are not rated comprise cancellations of units in unit trusts and sales of units in unit trusts, title to which is not transferred until settlement is received.
LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due or only at a significantly higher cost.
The Group produces cash flow forecasts to assist in the efficient management of the collection and payment of liquid assets and liabilities.
The Groups objectives in respect of liquidity are: to ensure that both the Group as a whole and individual entities within the Group have access to sufficient liquid funds to trade solvently and meet trading liabilities as they fall due: to allow the Group to maintain a flexible dividend policy, taking reference to prior year and prospective profitability, capital requirements and cash flow: and to provide the Group with appropriate flexibility over the transferability of its capital and cash balances.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balances required for working capital management is held in interest-bearing deposits of up to three months.
Regulated companies ensure that sufficient capital is maintained to meet regulatory requirements.

The subsidiaries within the Group which are regulated are required to maintain capital resources to comply with the regulatory capital requirements of the FCA and certain overseas financial regulators.
Headroom over regulatory capital is discussed by the Risk and Finance Committee.
Further information on the Risk and Finance Committee can be found in the Management Committees overview within the Governance section.
In addition to the capital held to meet regulatory capital requirements, the Group maintains sufficient cash resources to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due, based on regularly produced cash forecasts, modelling both normal and stressed conditions.
Liquidity risk is mitigated by the availability of the RCF and the high level of cash in the business.
INTERESTS IN STRUCTURED ENTITIES IFRS 12 requires certain disclosures in respect of interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities.
A structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group has assessed whether the funds it manages are structured entities and concluded that mutual funds and investment trusts managed by the Group are structured entities unless substantive removal or liquidation rights exist.
The Group has interests in these funds through the receipt of management and other fees and, in certain funds, through ownership of fund units.
The Groups investments in these funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective funds offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk.
The investments are included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in the balance sheet.
Where the Group has no equity holding in a fund it manages, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Groups maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees and any uncollected fees at the balance sheet date.
Where the Group does have an equity holding, the maximum exposure to loss constitutes the future and uncollected management fees plus the fair value of the Groups investment in that fund.
The Group does not sponsor any of the structured entities and there are no guarantees or commitments.
DIRECT HOLDINGS IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES Direct investments in unconsolidated structured entities comprise seed investments and hedges of awards in fund units in mutual funds and investment trusts, details of which are given below: Investment Management Financial management performance Net AUM assets Investment in performance fees Number of funds at FVTPL associates fees in the year receivable of funds bn m m m m As at 31 December 2018 46 31.3 211.3 339.0 15.8 As at 31 December 2017 37 34.5 110.1 32.2 308.7 19.1 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 134 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 5: Other notes continued NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER continued 5.4.
