Further funding for increased levels of waste removal was approved in 2018 in response tofurther geotechnical information.
Development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground $5.3bn The project was approved in May mine in Mongolia Rio Tinto 34%.
The detailed engineering design work and overall construction is mostly on track, but more detailed geotechnical information and difficult ground conditions have required a review of the mine design.
This, combined with fit-out and commissioning challenges with the main production shaft, is ultimately expected to result in a further revised ramp-up schedule to sustainable first production beyond the nine month delay indicated in October 2018.
Detailed design work is underway to estimate the impact these issues will have on cost and schedule.
