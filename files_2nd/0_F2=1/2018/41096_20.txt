In the four-month period from his appointment he made a number of critical executive appointments and promotions and established a new core management team to help him implement the Companys new strategy.
He formulated and gained approval from the Board for a new strategy which was presented to, and well received by, shareholders in December 2018.
The Committee considered that he fully achieved both personal objectives and awarded him a maximum bonus.
112 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Paul Richardson had two personal strategic objectives as described in the previous table.
The Committee reviewed progress against both the objectives and considered that good progress had been made in improving the rolling average NWC and addressing the underlying issues that influenced this measure.
In relation to IT transformation, while solid progress has been made, there remains more work to be done and the Committee rated this goal accordingly.
Overall, on the personal objectives, a performance level slightly above target was achieved.
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE WEIGHTINGS AND MEASURES FOR 2019 The Committee has reviewed the performance objectives for 2019 to ensure continued alignment with Company strategy.
The Group financial measures of headline PBT growth, headline PBIT margin improvement and revenue less pass-through costs growth will remain the same.
Further detail will be provided in next years Annual Report.
The Committee is of the view that the targets for the STIP are commercially sensitive and it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose them in advance of, or during, the relevant performance period.
To the extent targets are no longer commercially sensitive they will be disclosed at the end of the relevant performance period in that years Annual Report, as we have done in previous years.

The 2018 awards are subject to three equally-weighted independent performance conditions, being relative TSR, EPS and ROE.
The table below summarises the awards granted and the performance conditions against which participants will be measured.

2 The ROE measure for EPSP awards issued in 2013 and 2014 was a 10% to 14% average return.
As in previous years, WPPs TSR performance is compared to companies representing our most relevant, listed global competitors, weighted by market capitalisation.
For 2018 EPSP awards, the comparator group comprised Dentsu, Interpublic, Ipsos, Nielsen, Omnicom and Publicis.
TSR performance is calculated on a market  basis in both common and local currency weighted equally.
Using a dual basis ensures that the interests of both local and international investors are reflected in the performance measures.
EPSP MEASURES AND TARGETS FOR 2019-2022 The Committee will be engaging with major shareholders about the measures for the 2019 awards, prior to any awards being made later in2019.
ALIGNING PAY AND PERFORMANCE As set out in the Directors Compensation Policy, the Committees objective is to align variable compensation with the key strategic priorities of WPP, maximising the dynamic between pay and performance.
This dynamic is contingent upon the Committee setting challenging targets each year.
The following graph and table demonstrate the relationship between pay and performance over the last 10 years for the CEO.
With respect to 2018, the pay for both the current and previous CEO are included, as separate data sets.

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY The following table sets out the percentage change in total staff costs, headcount, dividends and share buy-backs.

The current CEO was appointed in September 2018 and therefore does not have a set of comparative 2017 data over which to compare changes in salary and benefits.
Base salary UK Taxable benefits Annual Bonus Chief Executive Officer Not applicable Not applicable Not applicable 1,2 All employees 1.2% 0.5% 9.9% Notes 1 The all employees numbers for the change in base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus have been calculated based on the annual average amount received.
2 Considering the worldwide structure and size of the Group and given the need to calculate benefits on the basis that an individual is resident in the UK for tax purposes, collating data on all employees was not practicable.
As a result, the population for the taxable benefits consists of UK employees only.
CEO PAY RATIO The new corporate governance regulations require companies to disclose a ratio of the CEOs remuneration relative to the workforce.
In view of the appointment of a new CEO during 2018, the Compensation Committee decided any reporting of the ratio of CEO pay to the wider workforce would not be meaningful for 2018.
The ratio will be included in the 2019 Compensation Committee report.

118 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IMPLEMENTATION OF REWARD POLICY FOR MANAGEMENT OUTSIDE THE BOARD As part of its review of the Directors Compensation Policy during 2019, the Committee will look at how it engages with the wider workforce on compensation and ensure that there is alignment between the policy for Executive Directors and the wider workforce.
TheCommittee places significant value on the views of employees and will seek to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms in placeto capture them.
The Company uses share-based compensation programmes to incentivise and retain employees, recruit new talent andto encourage astrong ownership culture among employees.
The use of the core share plans in 2018 is described below.
WPP STOCK PLAN 2018 WSP The WSP replaced the Restricted Stock Plan RSP in 2018.
Programmes making awards under the RSP now make awards under the WSP and the plan operates in a similar way.
The Executive Directors do not participate in any aspect of the WSP except for the deferred share bonus award.
All awards granted under the WSP are subject to malus and clawback conditions.
The WPP Leaders, Partners and High Potential programme made awards under the WSP to about 1,800 of our key executives in 2018.
Awards vest three years after grant, provided the participant is still employed within the Group.
In addition, senior executives have part oftheir annual bonus paid in the form of executive or performance share awards that vest two years after grant.
WPP SHARE OPTION PLAN 2015 During 2018, the WPP Share Option Plan 2015 was used to make awards to over 53,000 employees.
By 31 December 2018, options under this plan, and its predecessor, the Worldwide Ownership Plan, had been granted to approximately 179,000 employees over 90 million shares since March 1997.
While the Share Option Plan provides the authority to make executive option awards, in addition to all employee awards, no awards were granted in 2018.
The Executive Directors do not participate in this plan.
SHARE INCENTIVE DILUTION FOR 2008 TO 2018 The share incentive dilution level, measured on a 10-year rolling basis, was at 3.4% at 31 December 2018 2017: 3.3%.
It is intended that awards under all plans, other than share options, will all be satisfied with purchased shares held either in the ESOPs or in treasury.
