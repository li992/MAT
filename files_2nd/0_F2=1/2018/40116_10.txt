The additional costs of carrying additional hybrids for six months is outweighed by the savings realised over the life of the new hybrid.
In 2017 18, the combined coupon payments on the equity and debt accounted hybrid bonds was 128m, compared to 120m in 2016 17.
This increase was mainly due to the temporary position in the first six months when SSE made coupon payments on three hybrid tranches, prior to redeeming the 2012 hybrid bonds in October 2017.
Total hybrid payments are expected to fall to around 77m in 2018 19 as the full benefit of the replacement hybrids lower coupon rate is realised.

The coupon payments on the March 2017 debt accounted hybrid bonds are treated as finance costs under IFRS.
