OUR MARKETS UK economy Following an encouraging start to 2018, uncertainty around CONTINUED the outlook for global economic growth increased as the year progressed, fuelled by rising trade tensions and tightening monetary policy.
Against this backdrop, UK economic growth slowed, with the latest consensus estimates pointing to expected GROWTH growth in GDP of 1.3% in 2018, down from 1.8% for 2017.
However, the unemployment rate in the UK reduced slightly during the year and, as at the end of November, remained close to a four-decade IN OUR KEY low at 4.0%.
This pushed regular wage growth to 3.3% for 2018 and, as CPI inflation fell to 2.0% from a high of 3.1% in 2017, real wage growth turned positive during the year.
SECTORS Looking forward, the political uncertainty around the effects of the UKs planned exit from the European Union at the end of March and the shape of our future trading relationship with the rest of the world is high.
Therefore, despite the strong employment market and modest economic growth, by the end of 2018, consumer confidence had fallen to its lowest level since 2013, whilst the Deloitte UK CFO survey showed business optimism and risk appetite also fell during the year.
The ambiguity around Brexit and general political uncertainty associated with this means the outlook for UK economic growth is dependent on a range of potential outcomes and the varying levels of disruption related to these, but most economic forecasters expect GDP growth over the next three years to remain below the long-term trend, broadly around the same levels as in 2017-18.
We therefore expect growth in the overall UK property market to be modest over this period, although the availability and cost of financing is expected to remain supportive.
Moreover, the difference between the outlook for various sub-sectors is marked: Remco Simon while the outlook for retail and London residential remains Director of Strategy and Research challenging, structural trends in our two key sectors, regional housebuilding and industrial and logistics, remain positive.
UK economy Industrial and logistics market The UK logistics markets continues to benefit from continued Growth in GDP Wage growth growth in online retail, which made up 18.0% of all retail sales in 2018 according to the ONS.
This is up from 16.3% in 2017 and only 1.3% 3.3% 12.5% three years ago, and is expected to grow to well over 20% 1.8% in 2017 2.3% in 2017 in the next three years.
This continues to drive demand for modern, well-located logistics space.
The UK remains far ahead of other western economies in terms of the market share of online retail and data from Savills shows that, over the last three years, almost 45% Industrial and logistics market of the overall take-up of units over 100,000 sq ft was either from pure online retailers or distribution and third-party logistics Online retail sales proportion Logistics take-up sq ft providers, whilst traditional retailers also continue to invest in their logistics supply chain to compete with online rivals.

Affordability in the regions above the ten-year average.
This has triggered an increase in is healthier, with house prices at c. 6 to 7 times earnings.

The outlook for UK house units, with six units over 400,000 sq ft totalling 3.0m sq ft being prices is sensitive to the general economic outlook but, assuming built speculatively at the end of 2018, compared to only one such this remains stable, we expect further modest growth in regional unit at the end of 2017.
On an estimated total stock of around markets outperforming the less affordable London market.

With grade A availability, even including speculative 5 supply, at less than one year of total take-up, supply and demand remain balanced for now, so we expect rents to continue to grow in 2019.

The number of households in the UK is expected to grow According to Savills, industrial and logistics investment reached 8.3bn from 27.4m in 2016 to 31.6m by 2039 according to the ONS and, in 2018, which was below the record year in 2017 but above the despite further growth in construction activity, demand for homes five-year average.
By comparison, investment in retail property fell continues to outpace supply.
The net number of new homes built to just 5.5bn, down from an average 12bn p. a. over 2014 to 2016. in England increased to 222,000 in the year to March 2018, up 2% As a result, average UK industrial yields fell c. 50bps to 5.3% during from the 217,000 in the previous year, but this remains well below the year to September 2018 according to MSCI, with prime yields at the official government target of delivering 300,000 new homes a lower 4 to 4.5%.
