In the last two years, we have helped 83m hospitals, doctors and patients by launching 15 products units into shortage situations.
2017 In 2018, US hospitals faced a critical shortage of injectable medicines used for patient pain management after a 53m competitor experienced a significant manufacturing units disruption.
The shortage had a substantial impact on hospitals, as these medicines had to be rationed, which at times resulted in surgeries being delayed.
In response to this shortage, we significantly increased production of these products at our US manufacturing facility, by adding production lines, recruiting additional 57% staff and manufacturing around the clock.
We also worked increase closely with the FDA and US Drug Enforcement Agency to ensure we had the required raw materials.
