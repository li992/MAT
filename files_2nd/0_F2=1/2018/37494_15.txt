Volatility arising in insurance businesses Volatility included in the Groups statutory results before tax comprises the following: 2018 2017 m m Insurance volatility 506 196 Policyholder interests volatility 46 190 Total volatility 460 386 Insurance hedging arrangements 357 100 Total 103 286 The Groups insurance business has policyholder liabilities that are supported by substantial holdings of investments.
IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement.
The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments.
As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group.
Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the divisions results on the basis of an expected return in addition to results based on the actual return.
The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurance volatility.
The Group actively manages its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, inflation and market movements within the banking book through a comprehensive hedging strategy.
This helps to mitigate earnings, volatility and reduces the impact of market movements on the capital position.
The volatility movements in the period were largely driven by insurance volatility arising from equity market movements and credit spreads.
The capital impact of equity market movements is hedged within Insurance and this also reduces the IFRS earnings exposure.
