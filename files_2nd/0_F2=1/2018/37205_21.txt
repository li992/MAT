com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 103 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCOME STATEMENT INTRODUCTION The Groups financial statements have been split into sections to assist with their navigation and align with the Financial Review.
Accounting policies are contained within relevant notes and are boxed, with the basis of preparation and general policies collected in Section 5.
An explanation of the use of alternative performance measures APMs is provided on page 41.
REVENUE The Groups primary source of revenue is management fees.
Management fees are for investment management or administrative services and are based on an agreed percentage of the assets under management AUM.
Initial charges and commissions are for additional administrative services at the beginning of a client relationship, as well as ongoing administrative costs, and until January 2018, included profits earned on dealing within the unit trust managers box, known as box profits.
Performance fees are earned from some funds when agreed performance conditions are met.
Net revenue is stated after fee and commission expenses to intermediaries for ongoing services under distribution agreements.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018.
The adoption of this standard has not resulted in any changes to the way the Group accounts for revenue or costs of sales.
No judgements or changes in judgements were made as a result of application of this standard.
REVENUE Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of investment management services.
Revenue is shown net of any value added tax, rebates and discounts.
Our primary revenue components are accounted for as follows: management fees are satisfied over a period of time, and revenue is recognised in the same period in which the service is performed.
Management fees are calculated as a percentage of net fund assets managed in accordance with individual management agreements and are billed to the client each period shortly after the relevant asset data is available, with settlement terms commonly being 30 days: initial charges and commissions on sales of unit trusts are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period of the provision of investment management services.
Revenue for initial charges and commissions are recognised over a period of time, but payment is taken up front resulting in the recognition of contract liabilities: performance fees are calculated as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund above a defined hurdle and are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is highly probable that it will not be subject to significant reversal.
Such fees are normally recognised at the end of the relevant reporting period of the fund, and payment is collected shortly after: and box profits, which have not been earned by the Group since January 2018, are calculated as the difference between the cost of purchasing redeemed units at cancellation prices and reselling them at creation prices.
Box profits are recognised when the related transaction occurs.
Management fees and performance fees are both forms of variable consideration, however there is no significant judgement or estimation involved as the transaction price is equal to the amount determined at the end of each measurement period and is equal to what is billed to the customer as per contractual arrangements for each of the separate components of revenue listed above.
All components of the Groups revenue are performance obligations satisfied over time, and are generally not subject to returns or refunds.
The Group uses the output method to recognise revenue, applying the practical expedient that allows an entity to recognise revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice if that consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entitys performance completed to date.
This is appropriate because investment management services are generally satisfied over time because either the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the fund manager as the fund manager performs the service, or the fund managers performance enhances the assets that the fund controls.
FEE AND COMMISSION EXPENSES These are paid to third parties for ongoing services under distribution agreements and are charged to the income statement over the period in which the service is expected to be provided.
The services provided include the provision of access to a basket of fund products, information on financial products, promotional materials, ongoing services to clients and transaction processing.

REVENUE continued DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers on the basis of product type and geographical region, as this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Groups revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
The Groups product types can be broadly categorised into pooled funds and segregated mandates.
Segregated mandates are generally established in accordance with the requirements of a specific institutional investor.
In contrast, pooled funds, which include both mutual funds and investment trusts, are established by the Group, with the risks, exposures and investment approach defined via a prospectus which is provided to potential investors.
SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group offers a range of products and services through different distribution channels.
All financial, business and strategic decisions are made centrally by the Board of Directors the Board, which determines the key performance indicators of the Group.
Information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, the Board, on a single segment basis.
While the Group has the ability to analyse its underlying information in different ways, for example by product type, this information is only used to allocate resources and assess performance for the Group as a whole.
On this basis, the Group considers itself to be a single-segment investment management business.
Management monitors operating profit for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES The largest administrative expense is staff costs.
The other administrative expenses category includes certain significant costs such as administration fees, expenditure relating to non-capitalisable investment in the business, marketing and IT costs.
OPERATING LEASES Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
All of the Groups leases are operating leases and rental payments are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Contributions in respect of the UK employees at the rate of 15% of gross salary are made into the Jupiter Pension Scheme whose financial statements are available from the trustees at the registered office of the Company.
No liability is included in the balance sheet as no obligations were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Contributions made by the Group are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
FUND UNITS As described in Note 1.5 ii, deferred bonuses can be deferred into either options over the Companys shares or a cash equivalent to units in the Groups funds.
The expense included within wages and salaries in the income statement in relation to fund units for the year ended 31 December 2018 was 17.7m 2017: 5.2m.
Where bonuses are deferred into fund units, the fair value of the award is spread over the vesting period and included within staff costs.
The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date to the expected settlement amount, being the current market value of the underlying fund units.
Any increase or decrease in value is recognised in the income statement within staff costs.
The liability is included in the balance sheet as part of accrued expenses within trade and other payables see Note 3.9.
The Group hedges its exposure to price fluctuations in the underlying fund units by purchasing the fund units at the date of grant.
These are included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL on the balance sheet.
Any change in the fair value of the units is recognised in the income statement within other gains losses.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from certain employees by granting the right to either shares or options over shares, subject to certain vesting conditions and exercise prices.
These have been accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments.
The fair value of the awards granted in the form of shares or share options is recognised as an expense over the appropriate performance and vesting period.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model, the principal inputs being the market value on the date of award, discounted for any dividends foregone over the holding period of the award, and an adjustment for expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the number of eligible employees leaving the Group and the number of employees satisfying the relevant performance conditions.
Shares and options vest on the occurrence of a specified event under the rules of the relevant plan.
A summary of the charge taken to the income statement excluding social security for each share-based payment arrangement is shown below: 2018 2017 m m Interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan 1.0 Deferred Bonus Plan DBP 18.2 14.3 Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP 8.5 12.0 Sharesave Plan SAYE 0.5 0.4 Share Incentive Plan SIP 0.4 0.3 Total Note 1.4 26.6 27.0 The fair value of the services provided by employees has been calculated indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Fair value amounts for the options granted under the DBP, LTIP and SAYE schemes were determined using a Black Scholes option-pricing method and the following assumptions: 2018 2017 DBP 2017 LTIP 2018 SAYE 2018 DBP 2016 LTIP 2017 SAYE 2017 Weighted average share price 4.58 4.55 4.05 4.21 4.22 5.37 Weighted average exercise price 0.61 3.33 0.02 4.29 Weighted average expected volatility % 25.5 25.3 25.8 28.5 28.1 27.5 Weighted average option life years 3.6 3.9 3.9 3.1 4.2 3.5 Weighted average dividend yield % 0.4 4.5 3.5 3.5 3.2 Weighted average risk-free interest rate % 0.9 0.9 1.0 0.2 0.2 0.6 Expected volatility for options granted in 2018 and 2017 has been calculated using the historical volatility of the Group.

com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 107 The Group provides a sensitivity analysis to show the impact to the Groups profit before taxation in the event that forfeiture and performance condition assumptions exceed or are below the Groups estimations by the stated percentages.
2018 2017 Impact on the income statement of a change in leaver assumptions m m 5% 2.1 1.8 -5% 1.8 1.6 2018 2017 Impact on the income statement of a change in performance condition vesting assumptions m m 25% 1.0 0.8 -25% 1.0 0.8 SIGNIFICANT AREA OF ESTIMATION At the year end, the Group had approximately 20 million share-based awards in issue.
Each year, old awards vest and new awards are made.
In 2018, around 8 million new awards were issued.
Given the significance of share-based payments as a form of employee remuneration for the Group, share-based payments have been included as a significant accounting estimate in Note 5.1.
The principal estimations made relate to: forfeitures where awardees leave the Group as bad leavers and therefore forfeit unvested awards and accelerations where awardees are good leavers and their awards continue to vest but there is no longer an extended service period condition : and the satisfaction of performance conditions attached to certain awards.
These estimates are reviewed regularly and the charge to the income statement is adjusted appropriately at the end of the relevant scheme as a minimum.
The sensitivity analysis provided shows that the risk of material adjustment as a result of changes to our estimations by 5% for leavers and 25% for performance condition assumptions is not considered to be significant or material.
I INTERESTS IN OPTIONS UNDER PRE-LISTING SHARE PLAN These options were granted to certain employees prior to listing in June 2010 and allowed them to acquire shares at nominal value, subject to satisfying certain vesting and performance conditions.
The terms of the options allowed individuals to make a payment to the Company entitling them to take up rights to shares between one and five years after the grant date, depending on the individual award.
Some awards were modified in 2015, extending the vesting date by between one and three years.
The interests in options under preListing Share Plan were granted at the nominal price of 0.02, which gives them the characteristics of nil cost options and therefore the fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the award.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movement in, share options during the year: 2018 2017 WAEP WAEP Options outstanding Number Number At 1 January 720,000 0.02 860,000 0.02 Exercised 140,000 0.02 140,000 0.02 Forfeited 580,000 0.02 At 31 December 720,000 0.02 Exercisable at 31 December The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of these options was 4.56 2017: 4.85 per ordinary share.
No options were granted under this plan in 2018 or 2017.
For the options granted in 2010, the weighted average fair value per option granted was 1.48.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2017 was 0.8 years.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued II DEFERRED BONUS PLAN DBP All employees of the Group who are eligible for a bonus over a certain level, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are required to participate in the DBP.
The DBP provides for compulsory deferral of a proportion of bonus.
Deferrals can be made into either options over the Companys shares or a cash amount equivalent to the value of units in the Groups funds see Note 1.4 for information on the treatment of fund units.
The awards in respect of DBP are granted after the year end to which they relate.
The awards made in 2017 and 2018 in relation to 2016 and 2017 performance were granted in the form of nil cost options over the Companys shares, at a price calculated as the market price immediately prior to the date of the award.
Awards will also be made in 2019 in relation to 2018 performance, thus a charge for these awards has been taken to the income statement in 2018.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of these options was 4.66 2017: 4.64.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under this plan during the year was 4.51 2017: 3.78.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the share options outstanding under this plan at 31 December 2018 was 1.4 years 31 December 2017: 1.5 years.
III LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP All employees are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and may be granted in the form of options either at market value, nominal value or nil cost, restricted shares or conditional share awards over the Companys shares.
The LTIP awards granted in 2018 and 2017 took the form of options over the Companys shares.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of these options was 4.59 2017: 4.69.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under this plan during the year was 2.08 2017: 3.74.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the share options outstanding under this plan at 31 December 2018 was 2.7 years 31 December 2017: 3.2 years.
com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 109 IV SHARESAVE PLAN All eligible UK employees may participate in the Groups Sharesave Plan, which was introduced in 2010.
Under the terms of this plan, employees may enter into contracts to save up to the maximum amount permitted under legislation and, at the expiry of a fixed threeor five-year term, have the option to use these savings to acquire shares in the Company at a discounted price, calculated under the rules of the plan currently a 20% discount to the market price at the date of award.
Participants in the plan have six months from the date of vesting to exercise their option.
The weighted average fair value of the options granted under this plan during the year was 0.77 2017: 1.24.
The range of exercise prices of options granted under this plan is between 2.91 and 4.29.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the share options outstanding under this plan at 31 December 2018 was 2.6 years 31 December 2017: 2.7 years.
V SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP All eligible UK employees may participate in the Groups Share Incentive Plan, which was introduced in 2013.
Under the terms of this plan, employees may contribute from pre-tax salary up to the maximum amount permitted under legislation in any tax year, to be used to acquire shares in the Company at the market price on the relevant date.
Matching shares are then awarded by the Company on a one matching share for each share purchased basis.
The matching shares are subject to forfeiture where the employee leaves employment with the Group within three years of their award.
The number of matching shares purchased under this scheme during the year was 80,037 2017: 61,975.
VI INTERNATIONAL SHARE AWARD ISA All non-UK employees may participate in the Groups International Share Award, which was introduced in 2017 to create a non-UK plan similar to the Sharesave Plan.
Under the terms of this award, international employees are offered the opportunity to be granted a share option which is exercisable after three years and three months.
The exercise price is set at the same level as for the Sharesave Plan.
The number of awards made during the year was 9,020 2017: 23,133.
OTHER LOSSES GAINS Other losses gains in 2018 relate principally to losses made, net of hedging, on the Groups seed investment portfolio.
These investments, along with any related hedging instruments, are held at fair value through profit or loss see Note 3.4.

FINANCE INCOME The Group earns income as a result of holding cash in bank deposits.
Interest on cash and cash equivalents is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
FINANCE COSTS The majority of the finance costs are associated with the Revolving Credit Facility RCF.
See Note 3.8 for further details.
Interest payable is charged on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Finance costs include ancillary charges for commitment fees and non-utilisation fees that are charged as incurred.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE The Groups headquarters are based in the UK.
The Group pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries in which it operates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current tax, but there is also a charge or credit relating to tax payable for future periods due to income or expenses being recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes deferred tax.
Tax is charged to equity when the tax benefit exceeds the cumulative income statement expense on share plans.
The Group provides for current tax according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns in respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is considered recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax that has arisen in respect of equity items such as share-based payments is recognised directly in equity and not in the income statement.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year less the weighted average number of own shares held.
Own shares are shares held in an Employee Benefit Trust EBT for the benefit of employees under the vesting, lock-in and other incentive arrangements in place.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year for the purpose of basic EPS plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
For the purposes of calculating EPS, the share capital of the parent is calculated as the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of EPS is as follows: 2018 2017 Number Number Weighted average number of shares m m Issued share capital 457.7 457.7 Less own shares held 8.7 8.9 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 449.0 448.8 Add back weighted average number of dilutive potential shares 10.2 10.9 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 459.2 459.7 2018 2017 Earnings per share p p Basic 31.8 34.5 Diluted 31.1 33.7 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018
