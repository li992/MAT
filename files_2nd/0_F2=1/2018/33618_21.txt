OPERATING REVIEW KEY INPUTS AND COST BASE The Groups mining operations depend on many inputs, ranging from energy and water to labour and fuel, the most important of which are reviewed below.
As concentrate producers, Los Pelambres and Centinela require WATER reagents and grinding media.
As cathode producers using the Water is a precious commodity in the regions where the SX-EW process, Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldvar require Groupsmines operate, so its efficient use and recycling is sulphuric acid.
The availability, cost and reliability of these extremelyimportant.
inputsare central to the Groups cost management strategy, which focuses on cost control and security of supply.
Water for each operation is sourced either from the sea or from surface and underground sources.
Each operation has the necessary The Groups largest operation, Los Pelambres, is competitively permits for the supply of water at current production levels and positioned on the copper industry cost curve in the first quartile, Zaldvar submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment during but, like the Groups other operations and the industry as a theyear to extend its water extraction permit from current sources whole, it has a declining grade profile over time, which places beyond 2025, in line with its existing Life-of-Mine.

The Group optimises water efficiency by reducing demand, using untreated sea water and encouraging recycling across its operations.
ENERGY Water reuse rates depend on a range of factors and the Group The Group sources its energy from the main electricity grid in Chile, seeks to achieve an optimal rate, depending on circumstances the National Electric System SEN, formed following the merger early at each operation.

The SEN has an installed capacity The Group pioneered the use of untreated sea water in the 1990s of22.7 GW, supplying 99% of national demand, and its creation has and currently uses it at Centinela and Antucoya.
In 2018, sea water increased customers access to a range of power generation sources.

56 Antofagasta plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT SERVICE CONTRACTS AND KEYSUPPLIES The Groups Central Procurement Department negotiates corporatelevel agreements for key purchases such as mining equipment, tyres and reagents.
It also achieves synergies and economies of scale inother high-spend areas, while co-ordinating activities at each of themining operations.
A core team of experts defines product and service categories, and procurement policies and procedures are standardised across the Group.
The Group continually reviews its procurement processes , identifying additional cost-saving opportunitiesduring the coming years as part of its Cost and Competitiveness Programme.
In total, the Group has over 4,750 suppliers of goods and services.
Key contracts such as tyres, grinding media, mining and mobile equipment, chemicals, explosives, camp administration and maintenance, are under long-term agreements.
Price adjustment formulae reflect the market variations of key cost elements, such as steel, petrol and the Consumer Price Index CPI.
Contracts are normally negotiated between the operation and the supplier, but tenders and negotiations are generally co-ordinated, and sometimes led, by the Central Procurement Department in order to maximise leverage and benefits.
SULPHURIC ACID The Groups corporate procurement team uses a variety of strategies, The sulphuric acid market was tight during 2018 and will tighten such as full-price competition, price auctions, sourcing from China further during 2019, mainly due to supply disruptions across the and working with strategic suppliers, to reduce the costs to both world and scheduled smelter upgrades in Chile during 2018 and parties and achieve a sustainable, longer-term, lower cost base.
These upgrades have increased the regional deficit, raising demand for acid from outside the region and causing OIL PRICE prices to rise in 2018 and into 2019.
However, once the upgrades arecompleted, prices are expected to revert to previous levels.
Fuel and lubricants represent approximately 7% of total operating cost base and are used mainly by trucks hauling ore and waste at the mine The Group secures most of its sulphuric acid requirements under sites.
Improving fuel efficiency is a priority, with the amount of fuel contracts for a year or longer, normally at prices agreed in the latter consumed per tonne of material extracted being a key measure.

The oil price rose by approximately 27% during 2018, Costs are affected by the Chilean peso to US dollar exchange rate, putting pressure on the Groups operating cost base.
asapproximately 35-40% of the mining divisions operating costs are in Chilean pesos.
However, as some 50% of Chiles foreign exchange earnings are generated from copper sales, an increase in the copper price tends to weaken the Chilean peso and vice versa, so a natural hedge exists for the Group.

205,000 tonnes of ore per day and, using the large resource base The Board approved the project in October 2018 and the award of ofLos Pelambres, the mines life will be extended by 15 years beyond major contracts and long lead items with construction beginning in the current 20.
As part of this development the Group will submit a early 2019. new EIA to increase the capacity of the Mauro tailings storage facility and the mine waste dumps, and extend certain operating permits.
Throughput at the plant will increase from the current capacity of Work began on the environmental baseline study for the new EIA in 175,000 tonnes of ore per day to an average of 190,000 tonnes of 2017 and will be completed in 2020, along with the early stages of oreper day and first production is expected in the second half of community engagement activities, in preparation for submitting the 2021.
The plant expansion includes an additional SAG mill, ball mill EIA for approval in 2020. and the corresponding flotation circuit with six additional cells.
Capital expenditure for this phase was estimated in the pre-feasibility Annual copper production will be increased by 40,000 tonnes in the study completed in 2014 at approximately $500 million, the majority first full year of the expansion, reaching 70,000 tonnes towards the being on mining equipment, and increasing the capacity of the end of the first 15 years as the hardness of the ore increases and the concentrator and the Mauro tailings facilities.

The capital cost of the project is $1.3 billion, which includes Critical studies on tailings and waste storage capacity have been $500million for a 400-litres per second desalination plant and undertaken and are now progressing towards the feasibility study waterpipeline.
The desalination plant will supply water for the stage.
However, the project will only proceed once Phase 1 is expansion and a potential further growth phase Phase 2 and will significantly advanced and will require the submission of extensive actas a back-up for the existing operation in extreme dry conditions, permit applications, including the new EIA.

In 2017 the Group commenced preparation of the Mine Plan of Operations MPO, a prerequisite for permitting applications, and expects to complete it in 2019.
Following a thorough review, it will beready to be submitted to the relevant Federal and State agencies.
While the MPO is being reviewed the Company will advance the feasibility study.
After reaffirming Twin Metals right to renew its two federal mineralleases, the Department of Interior reinstated the leases to TMM in May 2018 and they are expected to be renewed during 2019.
In October 2018, the US Forest Service announced its decision to rescind its proposal to withdraw federal land from the Superior National Forest.
