com 19 Our strategy continued 1 Aktogay expansion project In December 2017 the Board approved a $1.2 billion expansion project to double the sulphide ore processing capacity of Aktogay from 25 million tonnes to 50 million tonnes, with first production expected in 2021.
The new sulphide concentrator will add c. 80 kt of annual copper production from 2022-27 and c. 60 kt from 2028 onwards.
During 2018 initial excavations and earthworks were completed and long lead-time equipment orders were placed.

com 21 Our strategy continued 2 Bozshakol clay plant optimisation The clay plant at Bozshakol has seen a significant improvement in ore throughput in 2018.
The plant was shut down for its first major maintenance in the first quarter of2018.
During the closure, optimisation works were undertaken on the crusher to install wear resistant crusher parts and backup equipment.
After completion of the optimisation works, the plant operated at an average of 109% of design ore throughput capacity over the second half of 2018.
In 2018, the clay plant increased the quantity of ore processed by 38% to 4.7 Mt 2017: 3.4 Mt, producing 13 kt of copper and 18 koz of gold.
Production will be suspended for 2-3 months in the first half of 2019 to upgrade the water recycling system and reduce fresh water consumption.
com 23 Our strategy continued 3 Baimskaya copper project The Board approved the acquisition of the Baimskaya copper project in Russia in August 2018 for a total consideration of $900 million.
The Peschanka deposit in the Baimskaya licence area is a large scale, copper porphyry with a low strip ratio of 0.8 and a strong gold by-product, making it a similar prospect to Bozshakol, the Groups first major growth project in Kazakhstan.
Copper equivalent output is expected to be 330 ktpa over the first ten years.
