Strategic Report continued Store Performance Prospects for the year were broadly in line with last year, but we converted a higher proportion of those prospects into customers, with move-ins up 3% on the prior year.
This reflects the occupancy focus over the period, with continued innovation and investment in our digital platform and operations.

sought to extend and redevelop.
The status of the Groups development pipeline is summarised in the table overleaf: Over the past eighteen months we have been more aggressive with our pricing strategy to drive occupancy growth, which led to a reduction in net achieved rent per sq ft in the second half of the prior financial year.
Following this fall in the period to March 2017, and hence a lower starting point in this financial year, rate stabilised in the first half of the financial year with no average rate growth.
In the second half, we achieved period on period average rate growth of 1.5% and as a result the average increase for the financial year was 0.8%.
Net achieved rent per sq ft at 31 March 2018 grew by 2.7% over the financial year.
Our pricing model reduces promotions and increases asking prices where individual units are in scarce supply.
This lowering of promotions, coupled with price increases to existing and new customers, leads to an increase in achieved net rents.
Rental growth can also be driven through sub-dividing larger rooms into smaller rooms, which yield a higher net rent per sq ft.
The table below shows the growth in net rent per sq ft for the portfolio over the year excluding Guildford Central.

During the year Armadillo acquired six stores, three stores in April 2017 from Quickstore in Exeter, Torquay and Plymouth, one store in December 2017 from Store it 4U in Stockton, and two stores in March 2018 from 1st Storage Centres in Newcastle and Gateshead.
This takes the Armadillo platform to 22 stores and 963,000 sq ft of MLA.
As with the other existing store acquisitions, the intention will be to upgrade and reconfigure the stores through additional investment to drive cash flow growth.
In the year to 31 March 2018, 1.5 million of capital expenditure has been invested to upgrade and fit out additional capacity in the Armadillo stores.
Armadillo is a lower-frills brand, with largely freehold conversions of existing buildings.
They are located in towns where we would not typically locate a Big Yellow, and have an average capacity of 44,000 sq ft lower than the 62,000 sq ft average for Big Yellow stores.
Armadillo provides a number of operational advantages to the Group, such as a wider platform to sell to national accounts, more opportunities for staff promotion, and more efficient use of the Companys marketing and central overhead costs.
The Group continues to look for opportunities to add to the Armadillo platform.
