Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 37 Summary of Group results Strong and sustainable financial performance with continued growth in profits and returns The Groups statutory profit after tax of 4,400 million was 24 per cent higher than in 2017, driven by increased underlying profit, a reduction in the payment protection insurance charge and a lower effective tax rate.
Statutory return on tangible equity increased by 2.8 percentage points to 11.7 per cent.
Underlying profit was 8,066 million, 6 per cent higher than 2017, with higher net income and lower total costs partly offset by the expected increase in the impairment charge.
The underlying return on tangible equity increased to 15.5 per cent 2017: 14.0 per cent.
Given the strong capital build of 210 basis points this year, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 2.14 pence per share, making a total ordinary dividend of 3.21 pence per share, an increase of 5 per cent on 2017 and in line with our progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.
In addition, the Board intends to implement a share buyback of up to 1.75 billion, equivalent to 2.46 pence per share.
The Groups pro forma CET1 ratio was 13.9percent post dividend and allowing for the proposed share buyback 31 December 2017: 13.9 per cent.

Net income of 17,768 million was 2 per cent higher than in 2017, with an increase in net interest income partly offset by slightly lower other income, while operating lease depreciation reduced by 9 per cent.
Net interest income of 12,714 million increased by 3 per cent compared to 2017, reflecting an improved net interest margin and slightly higher average interest-earning banking assets of 436 billion.
The net interest margin increased to 2.93 per cent with lower deposit costs and an increased contribution from the structural hedge, again more than offsetting continued pressure on asset margins.
In line with previous guidance, the Group expects a net interest margin of c. 2.90 per cent in 2019 and for the margin to be resilient through the plan period.
The Group manages the risk to its earnings and capital from movements in interest rates centrally by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or less sensitive to movements in rates.
As at 31 December 2018 the Groups hedge had a nominal balance of 180 billion 31 December 2017: 165 billion and an average duration of around four years 31 December 2017: around three years.
The Group generated 2.7 billion of income from the structural hedge balances in the year 2017: 2.5 billion.
The benefit from the hedge in the year was 1.4 billion over LIBOR 2017: 1.9 billion with a fixed earnings rate of approximately 0.7 per cent over LIBOR 2017: 1.1 per cent.
Other income of 6,010 million was slightly lower excluding the 146 million gain on sale of Vocalink in 2017.
Strong growth in new business within Insurance and Wealth, largely driven by increased workplace pensions income, was offset by slightly lower clients market activity in Commercial Banking while Retail remained stable, due in part to the launch of a simpler overdraft fee structure, which has now been fully implemented.
Other income includes a gain of 270 million on the sale of 18 billion of gilts and other liquid assets, compared with a 274 million gain on sale of such assets in 2017.
Operating lease depreciation reduced by 9 per cent to 956 million reflecting improved used car prices and the non-recurrence of accelerated depreciation charges within Commercial Banking in 2017.

Operating costs of 8,165 million were slightly lower than 2017, with business as usual costs down 4 per cent offset by expected higher investment expensed and depreciation which together increased by 10 per cent.
During 2018 the Group capitalised 1.5 billion of investment spend, equivalent to c. 60 per cent of above the line investment, in line with 2017.
Capitalised investment spend of 1.0 billion, or 67 per cent, related to intangible assets, a similar proportion to 2017.
The Groups market leading cost:income ratio continues to provide competitive advantage and improved by 2.5 percentage points to 49.3 per cent or 0.8percentage points to 46.0 per cent, excluding remediation with positive jaws of 5 per cent.
Remediation charges were 31 per cent lower at 600 million and included additional charges of 234 million in the fourth quarter relating to a number of small items across existing programmes.
The Group expects remediation charges to reduce significantly in 2019.
38 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Summary of Group results continued The Group continues to target a cost:income ratio including remediation in the low 40s exiting 2020, with reductions every year, and now expects operating costs to be less than 8 billion in 2019, a year ahead of the original target.

Credit quality remains strong with no deterioration in credit risk.
The Groups loan portfolios continue to be well positioned, reflecting the Groups continued prudent, through the cycle approach to credit risk, and benefiting from continued low interest rates and a resilient UK economy.
The gross asset quality ratio remains stable at 28 basis points, in line with full year 2017 and 2016.
On a net basis the asset quality ratio increased to 21 basis points and the impairment charge increased by 18 per cent to 937 million, both reflecting expected lower releases and write-backs.
Overall credit performance in the UK mortgage book remains strong with average mortgage loan to value ratios broadly stable at 44.1 per cent and new to arrears as a proportion of the total book remaining low.
New business average loan to value was 62.5 per cent and around 88 per cent of the portfolio continues to have loan to value ratios of less than 80 per cent.
The consumer finance portfolios continue to perform well with credit card business new to arrears as a proportion of the total book remaining low whilst the UK motor finance book continues to benefit from the Groups conservative approach to residual values and resilient used car prices.
In Commercial Banking, the book continues to benefit from effective risk management, including reduced single name and key sector exposures.
Together with a resilient economic environment, this has resulted in impairment charges remaining at a low level.
There have been no significant changes to the Groups economic assumptions included in its IFRS 9 models.
IFRS 9 is procyclical and introduces additional volatility but through the cycle expectations remain unchanged.
The Groups expected credit loss ECL allowance reflects a probability weighted view of future economic scenarios including a 30 per cent weighting of downside and a 10 per cent weighting of severe downside.
The weighted impact of these negative scenarios is already included within the Groups ECL allowance, which includes 0.6 billion in respect of the severe downside scenario.
Stage 2 loans and advances to customers as a percentage of total lending reduced by 3.5 percentage points to 7.8 per cent reflecting the sale of the Irish portfolio, model refinements and portfolio improvements whilst Stage 3 loans and advances were stable at 1.9 per cent.
At the same time coverage of Stage 2 assets has increased to 4.1 per cent of drawn balances and Stage 3 assets to 24.3 per cent.
At the end of 2018, the Group held a total ECL allowance of 4.4 billion, equivalent to over four years of net underlying cash write-offs and five years for the mortgage portfolio.
The Group expects an asset quality ratio of less than 30 basis points in 2019 and through the plan period reflecting continued strong asset quality and further reductions in releases and write-backs.

The Groups statutory profit after tax of 4,400 million was 24 per cent higher than in 2017, driven by increased underlying profit, a reduction in the payment protection insurance charge and a lower effective tax rate.
Earnings per share was 5.5p, 27 per cent higher than 2017 driven by increased statutory profit and lower share count.
Restructuring costs were 879 million, with 267 million incurred in the fourth quarter, and included severance costs relating to the Groups strategic investment plans as well as the expected costs of the integration of MBNA and Zurichs UK workplace pensions and savings business, ring-fencing and the rationalisation of the non-branch property portfolio.
The fourth quarter charge included 57 million of severance costs, making 247million for the year.
Restructuring costs are expected to reduce significantly in 2019 with ring-fencing and the integration of MBNA now substantially complete.
Market volatility and asset sales of 50 million included negative insurance volatility of 103 million, with 236 million of negative insurance volatility in the fourth quarter reflecting weaker equity markets and wider credit spreads, compared to positive insurance volatility of 286 million in 2017.
Market volatility Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 39 also included a 105 million loss on sale of the Irish mortgage portfolio and an adjustment to past service pension liabilities, both of which were recognised in the first half of 2018.
The increase in amortisation of purchased intangibles to 108 million 2017: 91 million and fair value unwind and other items to 319 million 2017:270million were both largely driven by the inclusion of MBNA.
The payment protection insurance charge of 750 million included an additional 200 million charged in the fourth quarter.
The additional charge was largely driven by an increase in average redress per case, additional operational costs to deal with potential complaint volatility and continued improvements in data interrogation and the Groups ability to identify valid claims, partly offset by lower reactive complaints which have been 12,000 per week in the second half of 2018, compared with the Groups assumption of 13,000 per week.
The outstanding balance sheet provision at 31December 2018 was 1.3 billion and continues to assume around 13,000 complaints per week until the timebar in August 2019.
Taxation The tax expense was 1,560 million 2017: 1,728 million representing an effective tax rate of 26 per cent 2017: 33 per cent.
The lower effective tax rate was driven by the reduction in non-deductible conduct provisions, including remediation.
The Group continues to expect the effective tax rate to reduce to around 25 per cent in 2020.
Return on tangible equity The return on tangible equity was 11.7 per cent up from 8.9 per cent in 2017, reflecting the increase in statutory profit after tax, and slightly lower average tangible equity.
The underlying return on tangible equity increased to 15.5 per cent 2017: 14.0 per cent reflecting increased underlying profit.
The Group continues to expect a return on tangible equity of 14 to15 per cent in 2019.

Loans and advances to customers were stable at 444 billion with growth in targeted segments offset by the 4 billion sale of the Irish mortgage portfolio and a reduction of 2 billion in the closed mortgage book.
The growth in targeted segments included 3billion from start-ups, SME and Mid Markets and 1billion from UK Motor Finance whilst the open mortgage book remained broadly flat at 267 billion.
The Group continues to optimise funding and target current account balance growth, with Retail current accounts up 5 per cent to 74 billion 31December 2017: 70 billion and Commercial current account balances at 35 billion 31 December 2017: 30 billion.
The loan to deposit ratio was stable at 107 per cent.
Wholesale funding increased by 22 per cent to 123billion, compared to 101 billion at 31 December 2017, as the Group refinanced Bank of England Funding for Lending Scheme maturities and increased liquidity buffers.
The Groups liquidity surplus continues to exceed the regulatory minimum and internal risk appetite with a liquidity coverage ratio LCR of 130 per cent 31December 2017: 127 per cent and LCR eligible assets of 129 billion 31 December 2017: 121 billion.

3 The CET1, total, leverage and MREL ratios at 31 December 2018, 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2017 are reported on a pro forma basis, reflecting the dividends paid up by the Insurance business in February 2019 and February 2018 respectively in relation to prior year earnings.
The CET1 ratio is also reported post dividends and share buyback.
The Groups balance sheet remains strong with capital build of 210 basis points, pre 2018 dividends, and a pro forma CET1 ratio of 13.9 per cent post proposed buyback and Insurance dividend.
40 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Summary of Group results continued The capital build included 195 basis points from underlying performance, 25 basis points from earnings related dividends received from the Insurance business and 25 basis points in relation to the sale of the Irish mortgage portfolio.
Other movements, resulting in a net increase of 3 basis points, included the impact of structural changes arising from transfers between Insurance and the ring-fenced bank, risk-weighted asset reductions, market movements and expected pension deficit contributions.
This was partly offset by 38 basis points for PPI charges.
The Group continues to expect ongoing capital build of 170 to 200 basis points per year, after allowing for the impact of estimated RWA inflation and increased pension contributions.
In July 2018, the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA reduced the Groups Pillar 2A CET1 requirement from 3.0 per cent to 2.6 per cent, increasing to 2.7per cent with effect from 1 January 2019 to reflect commencement of the UKs ring-fencing regime.
In addition the countercyclical capital buffer rate on UK credit exposures increased to 1.0 per cent in November 2018 resulting in a countercyclical capital buffer for the Group of 0.9 per cent.
The Boards view of the level of CET1 capital required for the Group remains around 13 per cent, plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.
The transitional total capital ratio increased to 23.1 per cent on a pro forma basis 31 December 2017: 21.5 per cent and the Group remains well positioned to meet its MREL requirement from 2020 with a pro forma transitional MREL ratio of 32.6 per cent 31 December 2017: 26.0 per cent.
Theleverage ratio on a pro forma basis increased to 5.6 per cent 31 December 2017: 5.4 per cent.
Tangible net assets per share of 53.0 pence 1 January 2018: 51.7 pence was up 1.3 pence with an increase of 4.4 pence before dividends of 3.1 pence paid in 2018, driven by increased statutory profit after tax partly offset by the effects of the share buyback and other reserve movements.
Dividend and share buyback The Group has a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy whilst maintaining the flexibility to return surplus capital through buybacks or special dividends.
The Boards view of the current level of capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties remains around 13 per cent plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.
Given the strong business performance in 2018 the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 2.14 pence per share.
This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 1.07 pence per share that was announced in the 2018 half year results.
The total ordinary dividend per share for 2018 of 3.21pence per share has increased by 5 per cent from 3.05pence per share in 2017.
The Group is planning on the basis of an orderly EU withdrawal and, given the resilience of the UK economy, intends to implement a share buyback of up to 1.75 billion 2017: 1 billion which will commence in March 2019 and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2019.
The Boards current preference is to return surplus capital by way of a buyback programme given the amount of surplus capital, the normalisation of ordinary dividends, and the flexibility that a buyback programme offers.
Given the total ordinary dividend of 3.21 pence per share and the intended share buyback, equivalent to up to 2.46 pence per ordinary share, the total capital return for 2018 will be up to 5.67 pence per share, an increase of 27 per cent on the prior year, equivalent to 4.0 billion.
Ring-fencing The Group successfully launched its new non ring-fenced bank, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc in 2018, transferring in non ring-fenced business from the rest of the Group, thereby meeting its legal requirements under ring-fencing legislation.
As a predominantly UK retail and commercial bank, the effect on the Group has been relatively limited, with minimal impact on the majority of the Groups retail and commercial customers.
As the vast majority of the Groups business has continued to be held by Lloyds Bank plc and its subsidiaries there has not been a material impact on the financial strength of Lloyds Bank plc.
