This was to avoid a binary approach to awards under the targets.
The Committee believes this approach provides a better incentive for employees.
For 2018, a range was set for rental growth, with a threshold level for achievement.
As noted on page 97, ranges have been introduced this year for certain operational measures.
The Committee is focused on ensuring that setting annual bonus targets should not be at the expense of our long-term strategy.
The measures in the Deliver projects and transactions successfully section above, include targets with a duration of more than one year that are important to the long-term success of the business.
It is difficult to give more detailed disclosure than that set out above as the identification and achievement of these targets is commercially sensitive.
Full disclosure will be made once the projects have been completed.
