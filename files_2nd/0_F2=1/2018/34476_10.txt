STRATEGIC REPORT Key performance indicators KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS KPIS HELP MANAGEMENT MEASURE PROGRESS AGAINST OUR SIX STRATEGIC PILLARS AND  FINANCIAL MEASURES We believe it is vital to ensure alignment between our Executive Teams strategic focus and the long-term interests of shareholders.
As a result, elements of Executive remuneration are based on performance against the following measures: revenue growth, adjusted profit before tax growth and adjusted retail wholesale return on invested capital.
You can read more about our Remuneration Policy on pages 101 to 102.
To improve the comparability of our operating performance relative to our luxury peer group and to simplify our disclosure, we now report on Group adjusted operating profit growth and adjusted operating profit margin rather than previously where we had reported retail wholesale segment profitability.
Our KPIs now reflect this change.
