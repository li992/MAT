Impact Statement on the anticipated effects of Brexit The decision made by the UK to leave the European Union, or Brexit as it has become known, means that all companies with interests in the UK or the European Union must embrace the challenges that this decision will bring.
NMC Health has reviewed its position in this respect.
We have a small business footprint in the UK, principally through the operation of Aspen Healthcare.
There may be some effect on Aspen Healthcare as a result of potential negative economic effects affecting the UK and the ability of our UK business to attract sufficient calibre and quantity of doctors and other clinical staff from outside the UK, and our UK business has a number of contingency plans to deal with such issues to ensure that the provision of services is not interrupted.
The Group also has a number of IVF businesses across Europe which are not dependent on patients, staff, goods, services and expertise from the UK, so aside of any European-wide economic difficulties or uncertainties resulting from Brexit, we expect these businesses to be unaffected.
Overall the exposure for NMC Health as a group is low and manageable as a result of limited dependence financially and operationally on the movement of people, goods, services and capital between the UK and Europe.
Therefore, whilst we will be keeping our position and planning under review, irrespective of the final negotiated or non-negotiated position regarding Brexit between the UK and European Union, NMC Health does not expect any material effect on the Group as a result of Brexit.
Political donations Neither the Company nor any subsidiary company in the Group made any political donations during the year ended 31 December 2018.
Whilst the Company has no intention of making formal political donations in the future, the Board acknowledge that given the wide interpretation of such donations, certain business events in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or the Board, may wish to participate may be caught under the formal definition of political donations.
The Company will therefore again be seeking approval from shareholders at this years annual general meeting, for a small approved limit for political donations, for use in such circumstances.
If this is approved by shareholders, the Board will provide full details of any such payments made in the next annual report.
Financial Instruments The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group, and the exposure of the Group to financial instruments, are included in note 39 to the financial statements on pages 153 to 155.
Subsequent Events Details of any important and material events affecting the Group which have occurred since the end of the 2018 financial year, are set out in note 44 to the consolidated financial statements on page 157.
Future Developments The Groups strategy and potential future development are outlined in the Group Strategic Report on pages 4 to 35.
Research and development The Eugin Foundation, part of the Clinica Eugin business, carries out research and development focused on fertility and human reproduction with particular regards to personal and social aspects as well as promotion of health.
Branches The Group normally operates across all jurisdictions where it has a business presence through the incorporation of registered entities, but also operates through a number of branches where this is considered appropriate from an operational or regulatory perspective.
