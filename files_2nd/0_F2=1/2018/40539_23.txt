As disclosed in the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report, the Relative TSR and cash flow measures partially vested 100% and 46% respectively.
The cash flow performance period ending 31 December 2017 was retested to reflect a change in the 2017 statutory cash flow which has increased the average cash flows.
The Return on Equity RoE element was measured in June 2018 following the release of competitor accounts.
RoE did not achieve the required minimum level.
Due to the change in cash flow, there was a small change to the value vested under the 2015 LTIS from the amount reported in the 2017 Annual Report.
The table below reflects the final 2015 LTIS.
The portion of the 2015 LTIS for which the level of vesting was determined is shown in the Remuneration table on page 85.

The RoE calculations, based on closing equity, were finalised in June 2018.
As the average TP ICAP RoE was lower than the average competitor group RoE there was nil payment for the RoE element of the 2015 awards.
Vesting of 2016 LTIS awards audited Long-term incentive scheme LTIS audited The former CFO, Andrew Baddeley, was granted an Award under the LTIS on 18 May 2016 with a maximum cash value of 245,455.
The Remuneration Committee determined, having been defined as a good leaver pursuant to the rules of the LTIS, that the Award would vest once performance had been assessed following the Termination Date, subject to the applicable performance conditions measured to the date his employment terminated and reduction for time pro-rata from the date of Award to the date his employment terminated.
Details of the performance outcome and vesting are shown in the table below.

As the average TP ICAP RoE was lower than the average competitor group RoE there was nil payment for this element of the 2016 awards.
The cash flow performance period ended 31 December 2017 was re-tested to reflect a change in the 2017 statutory cash flow which increased the average cash flows.
For Mr. Baddeley, this increased his cash flow based payment by 638.42 from the estimated amount notified to the Remuneration Committee in March 2018.
Payment was made to Mr. Baddeley in the amount of 73,768.95.

com 98 Governance report Report of the Remuneration Committee continued Directors Remuneration Policy unaudited The Directors Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM and would not normally be due for renewal until 2020.
However, for the reasons set out in the Committee Chairmans introduction to the Remuneration Report, we have decided to submit an amended policy for shareholder voting at the 2019 AGM to be effective from 1 January 2019.
This policy has been developed in the context of both the approach to remuneration throughout the Group and shareholder expectation.
The principal amendment is to replace the previous Transformation Long-Term Incentive Plan that was put in place primarily for the former Executive Director team, with a conventional Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Background In reviewing and approving the general principles of the Companys Remuneration Policy which applies throughout the Group, the Remuneration Committee took account of the Groups goal to become the worlds most trusted source of liquidity in hybrid OTC markets and the best operator in global hybrid voice broking.
The Remuneration Committee was mindful that the Groups strategy to achieve that objective is to continue to develop its business, operating as an intermediary in the worlds major wholesale OTC and exchange traded financial and commodity markets, with the scale and breadth to deliver superior performance and returns, underpinned by strong financial management disciplines without actively taking credit and market risk.
The Remuneration Committee also took into account general practices in the parts of the financial services sector in which the Company operates, and in particular those of the Companys competitors which include BGC Partners Inc. and Compagnie Financire Tradition.
These practices are characterised by high levels of variable remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders to pay remuneration in line with market practice in the sectors in which the Company operates.
The Companys Remuneration Policy is designed to attract, motivate and retain employees with the necessary skills and experience to deliver the strategy, in order to achieve the Groups objectives.
The key drivers of our Remuneration Policy are: Alignment to culture Align the interests of the Executive Directors, with the long-term interests of shareholders and strategic objectives of the Group: Include incentives that are aligned with and support the Groups business strategy and align executives to the creation of long-term shareholder value: To reinforce a strong performance culture, across a range of performance metrics, including behaviours, risk management, customer outcomes and the development of the Groups culture in line with its values over the short and long-term: and To align management and shareholder interests through building material share ownership over time.
Clarity To clearly communicate our Remuneration Policy and reward outcomes to stakeholders.
Simplicity To ensure that our Remuneration Policy is clear and easily understood.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 99 Risk To provide a balanced package between fixed and variable pay, and long and short-term elements, to align with the Groups strategic goals and time horizons whilst encouraging prudent risk management: and To ensure reward processes and policies are compliant with applicable regulations, legislation and market practice, and are operated within the bounds of the Boards risk appetite.
Predictability To set robust and stretching performance targets which reward exceptional performance: and To set remuneration within the limits established under the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Proportionality To attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors and senior employees by providing total reward opportunities which, subject to individual and Group performance, are competitive within our defined markets both in terms of quantum and structure for the responsibilities of the role: To ensure that remuneration practices are consistent with and encourage the principles of equality, inclusion and diversity: To consider wider employee pay when determining that of our Executive Directors: and To align management and shareholder interests.
Further information on risk management The Remuneration Committee considered the relationship between incentives and risk when approving the Remuneration Policy which will apply throughout the Group.
Details of the Groups key risks and risk management are set out in the Strategic report of this Annual Report and Accounts on pages 38 to 43.
The majority of transactions are brokered on a Name Passing basis where the business is not a counterparty to a trade.
Commissions earned on these activities are received monthly in cash.
The business does not take any trading risk and does not hold principal trading positions.
The business only holds financial instruments for identified buyers and sellers in matching trades which are generally settled within one to three days.
The business does not retain any contingent market risk and is not exposed to any material counterparty credit risk.
The business does not have valuation issues in measuring its profits.
The Companys Remuneration Policy reflects the risk profile of the Group, is consistent with and promotes sound and effective risk management and does not encourage risk-taking.
The Companys Remuneration Policy is consistent with the measures set out in the Groups compliance manuals relating to conflicts of interest.
The Companys policy is to ensure that variable remuneration is not paid through vehicles or methods that facilitate avoidance of the Remuneration Code.

Minimal pension provision and benefits are provided, the Board considering that employees are best placed to determine priorities for funds set aside for remuneration.
There are a number of different bonus schemes in operation throughout the Group for Brokers, Senior Management and other employees.
Brokers bonus schemes are described below: all other bonuses are generally discretionary.
In addition, the Deferred Bonus Plan introduced for Senior Managers for the 2015 bonus year continued for the 2018 bonus year.
Under this Plan, employees identified as Senior Managers had 20% of their discretionary 2018 bonus award deferred into equity for a three-year period.
The grants of equity under the deferred bonus plan are expected to be made in Q2 2019 and are subject to forfeiture, in whole or in part, in the event the employee resigns or employment is terminated for gross misconduct as defined in the Employee Handbook.
102 employees participated in the 2018 Deferred Bonus Plan with participants located in London, New York, New Jersey, Paris, Frankfurt, Sydney and Singapore.
Throughout the annual discretionary bonus review cycle the Group General Counsel and the Chief Risk Officer are consulted in order to validate that there are no reasons why an employee ear-marked to received a bonus should have their bonus withheld.
The Remuneration Committee does not believe that a formal capping of bonuses for Senior Management and Brokers is consistent with the delivery of enhanced returns to shareholders and accordingly no caps have been introduced on Senior Management or Broker bonuses at this time.
We will continue to review this matter in light of any future changes to the Remuneration Code.
Remuneration policies for Brokers unaudited The Companys Remuneration Policy for Brokers is based on the principle that remuneration is directly linked to financial performance, generally at a desk team level, and is calculated in accordance with formulae set out in contracts of employment service agreements.
These formulae take into account the fixed costs of the Brokers: variable remuneration payments are therefore based on the profits that the Brokers generate for the business together with an assessment of individual performance and conduct against core Group values Honesty, Integrity, Respect and Excellence.
Initial contract payments are only paid upfront when a claw-back provision is included in the contract of employment service agreements.
Typically, Brokers receive a fixed salary paid regularly throughout the year, with a significant portion of variable remuneration dependent on their revenue, performance and conduct which is paid after the revenue has been fully received in cash.
Remuneration policies for Control Functions unaudited The Companys Remuneration Policy for Control Functions is that remuneration is adequate to attract qualified and experienced employees, is in accordance with the achievement of objectives linked to their functions, and is independent of the performance of the business areas they support.
Employees in such functions report through an organisation structure that is separate to and independent from the business units.
Heads of Control Functions are designated as Remuneration Code Staff and accordingly their remuneration is reviewed by the Remuneration Committee as part of the Senior Manager bonus review undertaken in January and February each year.

com Remuneration m Remuneration m 106 Governance report Report of the Remuneration Committee continued Executive Directors service agreements and loss of office entitlements unaudited The Chief Executive Officers contract may be terminated by either party on the expiry of twelve months written notice by either party save in circumstances justifying summary termination or by making a payment in lieu of notice at the Companys election.
The Company will consider the scope for requiring the Executive Director to mitigate their loss when taking account of all the circumstances surrounding the termination of employment.
The Executive Director would also be entitled to a payment for accrued but untaken holiday.
The Chief Financial Officers and the Group General Counsels contract may be terminated by either party on the expiry of twelve months written notice by either party save in circumstances justifying summary termination or by making a payment in lieu of notice at the Companys election.
Where the Executive Director is deemed to be a good leaver, the Remuneration Committee may, at its sole discretion, award a part-year bonus for the period worked.
The bonus will be assessed on demonstrated performance over the part-year.
Post-termination restrictive covenants also apply to each Executive Director.
The determination of good leaver status will be determined at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In addition to the contractual rights to a payment on loss of office, any employee including the Executive Directors may have additional statutory and or common law rights to certain additional payments, for example in a redundancy situation.
When determining payments for loss of office, the Company will take account of all relevant circumstances on a case by case basis including but not limited to the contractual notice provisions and outstanding holiday: the best interests of the Company: whether the Executive Director has presided over an orderly handover: the contribution of the Executive Director to the success of the Company during their tenure: and the need to compromise any claims that the Executive Director may have or to pay the Executive Directors legal costs on a settlement agreement.
Under the LTIP, the full terms and conditions of the awards are contained in the Plan documents.
In the event that an Executive Director leaves employment the default position is that they will forfeit participation in the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee can choose to exercise its discretion and consider the employee to be a good leaver.
Good leavers will other than in exceptional circumstances be eligible to retain a time pro-rated portion of their LTIP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The time-reduced participation level will reflect the period of employment from the start of the performance period to the termination date.
Any vesting will be subject to the performance conditions and shares awarded at the Normal Vesting Date subject to the Rules of the LTIP.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 107 Non-executive Directors appointment letters unaudited The Non-executive Directors serve under letters of appointment which are not for a fixed term but are terminable on the earliest of the Director not being re-elected at an AGM, removed as a Director or required to vacate office under the Articles of Association, on resignation, at the request of the Board or subject to six months notice for the Chairman or three months notice for the other Non-executive Directors.
The fee payable to a new Non-executive Director will be in line with the fee structure for Non-executive Directors in place at the date of appointment.
Recruitment of Directors unaudited The Remuneration Committees approach to setting remuneration for new Executive Directors is to ensure that the Company pays market rates, with reference to internal pay levels, the external market, location of the Executive and remuneration received from the previous employer.
Salary will be provided in line with market rates, and the Remuneration Committee reserves discretion to offer appropriate pension and benefit arrangements, which may include the continuation of benefits received in a previous role in exceptional circumstances only.
Ongoing variable pay awards for a newly appointed Executive Director will be as described in the Policy table, subject to the same maximum opportunities.
It is not currently intended that future service contracts for Executive Directors would contain terms differing materially from those summarised in this report, including with respect to notice provisions.
The Remuneration Committee may consider offering additional cash or share-based payments to buy-out existing awards forfeited by a new Executive Director when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Any such buy-out payments would mirror so far as possible the remuneration lost when leaving the former employer.
The Remuneration Committee may avail itself of the current Listing Rule exemption to make such buy-out awards where doing so is necessary to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of the relevant individual.
Relocation payments may also be set, within limits to be determined by the Remuneration Committee, where considered appropriate and in the Companys best interests to do so.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Group will honour any contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director.
