PERFORMANCE REVIEW: POWER GENERATION Flexible, low carbon and renewable generation Long-term earnings stability and opportunities to optimise returns from the transition to a low carbon economy.
Drax Power Station remains the largest power station in the UK.
Between Q4 2017 and Q3 2018 the station met 5% of the UKs electricity needs, whilst providing 12% of its renewable electricity, alongside important system support services.
With an increase in intermittent renewables and a reduction in the thermal generation provided by coal, the energy system of the future will require solutions which are flexible and able to respond quickly to changes in system demand.
These long-term needs inform our generation model and options for future growth.

Remeasurements reflect gains and losses on derivative contracts.
Not all MWs are equal, the energy market requires more than just low-carbon electricity Historically non-generation system support services have been provided by baseload thermal generation coal and gas.
As these assets withdraw from the market, and at the same time the level of intermittent generation increases, Drax is well positioned to meet these system needs and provide increasingly important and valuable services to the UK energy system.
Biomass, pumped storage, hydro and gas are all strategically aligned with these needs and enable Drax to offer a full suite of services to the grid: Renewable and low carbon Voltage control electricity Reactive Power Flexible dispatchable generation Black start Reserve Frequency Response Headroom and footroom Find out more: Inertia www.
