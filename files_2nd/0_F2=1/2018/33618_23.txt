OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED THE COPPER MARKET: SUPPLIERS TO A CHANGING WORLD As the world develops and becomes ever more environmentally aware, the demand for copper increases.
The Group is responding by supplying the copper needed for a more sustainable world.
MARKET ENVIRONMENT REFINED COPPER During the first half of 2018 the copper price was well supported, 2018 MARKET PERFORMANCE trading above $3.00 lb on good demand growth, favourable world The LME copper price at the beginning of 2018 was $3.27 lb economic prospects and production uncertainties due to an unusually andended the year at $2.70 lb, averaging $2.96 lb over the year, large number of union negotiations.
However, by the middle of the anincrease of 5.9% compared with 2017. year no significant labour disruptions had occurred and investment community sentiment had turned negative as trade relations Copper supply was relatively steady during the year, with mine deteriorated between the US and China.
Although the fundamental production facing a low disruption rate compared with previous supply and demand characteristics remained positive for the year, years.
Demand was supported by the good performance of the global sentiment outweighed this and copper prices came under pressure, economy, especially in China, despite the trade tension between China correcting below $3.00 lb, and trading between $2.65 lb and and the US.
$2.85 lb during the second half of the year.
Global mine production accounts for some 87% of the total refined supply and is estimated to have grown by 2.8% during 2018, in part driven by good performance and a low rate of disruption in Chile, thelargest producer in the world, where mine production is estimated to have increased by 5% compared to 2017.
Secondary copper supply is estimated to have remained flat or increased marginally as the drop in the copper price reduced scrapavailability and the Chinese ban on the import of lower-grade scrap disrupted the usual trade flow and treatment of scrap.
Scrap conversion to refined copper is coming under pressure in China as REFINED CONSUMPTION BY REGION the country enacts  legislation restricting the import of dirty lower-grade scrap, which has meant that demand in China for other forms of copper concentrate, blister, cathodes has 8% been firm.
The Groups average realised price in 2018 was $2.81 lb, 5% below 16% the average LME price, reflecting a net negative provisional pricing adjustment at the end of the year of $188 million.
49% MARKET OUTLOOK The market was in a slight deficit in 2018 and this deficit is expected 10% to increase in 2019 as mine supply continues to be affected by the long-term trend of grade decline and lack of new investment, with few projects coming into production in the near future.

Demand will also rise as electric vehicle China Europe manufacture and investment in renewable energy increases, but the Other Asia Rest of world impact of this will be more significant in three or four years time.

MARKET OUTLOOK Further increases in smelter capacity and the reopening of Tuticorin are expected in 2019, while growth in concentrate production will be limited, leading to a tight copper concentrate market that should lead to declining TC RCs.
The annual terms for 2019 have been agreed at levels close to $80 per dry tonne of concentrate and 8c lb of refined copper, below the levels agreed for 2018. antofagasta.
