Strategic report STRATEGIC REPORT IRON ORE IRON ORE Anglo Americans iron ore operations provide customers with high iron content ore, a large percentage of which is direct-charge product for blast furnaces.
In South Africa, we have a majority share 69.7% in Kumba Iron Ore, while in Brazil we have developed the integrated Minas-Rio operation.
HIGHLIGHTS STRATEGIC FOCUS Delivering sustainable stakeholder returns by unlocking the full potential of Kumbas assets through safe, efficient 5% and innovative operational performance increase in underlying EBITDA at Kumba Kumba is well positioned to drive margin expansion across Themba Mkhwanazi the value chain through higher price realisation from CEO improved product quality while continuing to deliver cost Kumba Iron Ore savings and operational efficiencies $1.5 billion Creating value by leveraging Kumbas endowment in the underlying EBITDA at Kumba Northern Cape for mine life extensions Ramp up to consistent production, following the restart of operations at Minas-Rio.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE Kumba Kumba Underlying EBITDA increased by 5% to $1,544 million Total production decreased by 4% to 43.1 Mt 2017: $1,474 million, mainly driven by a $1 tonne increase 2017: 45.0 Mt, in response to higher stock levels arising inthe average realised iron ore price, partly offset by a 4% from Transnets rail constraints.
Production volumes were decrease in export sales volumes and a 3% increase in FOB also affected by a small decrease in processing plant yields unit costs.
The increase in unit costs was driven by lower as Kumba focused on producing high quality products to production, higher strip ratios and higher fuel costs, largely maximise the value of tonnes railed to port and benefit from offset by operational efficiencies and cost-saving initiatives.
the strong demand for premium, high grade ore.
Sales volumes decreased by 4% to 43.3 Mt 2017: 44.9 Mt In line with its strategy, production at Sishen reduced by owing to the impact of third party rail constraints and 6%to 29.2 Mt 2017: 31.1 Mt, while output at Kolomela single loading of vessels resulting from the scheduled remained constant at 13.9 Mt.
Waste stripping at Sishen refurbishment of the shiploader by Transnet at Saldanha increased by 13% to 182.1 Mt 2017: 161.7 Mt, with Port in the second half of 2018.
Consequently, total continued improvements in efficiencies through increased finished stock held at the mines and port increased to primary mining equipment productivity.
production performance at Kolomela led to a 1% increase in waste stripping to 56.0 Mt 2017: 55.6 Mt.
Minas-Rio Minas-Rio recorded an underlying EBITDA loss of Minas-Rio $272million 2017: $435 million gain, reflecting the Production decreased by 80% to 3.4 Mt 2017: 16.8 Mt suspension of operations from March 2018, following the following the suspension of operations since March 2018. two leaks in the 529 kilometre iron ore pipeline from the The resumption of the operations occurred following the mine to the Port of Au.

Minas-Rio A key regulatory approval relating to the Minas-Rio Step 3 licence area was granted on 21 December 2018, providing greater operational flexibility and access to higher grade iron ore to support the increase of production towards the full design capacity of 26.5 Mtpa.
As a result, 2019 production guidance for Minas-Rio was increased to 18-20 Mt previously 16-19 Mt.
In addition, 2019 unit cost guidance was reduced to $28-$31 tonne previously $30-$33 tonne.
Construction is under way for the next tailings dam lift and we expect to be ready for the normal process of conversion of the installation licence to an operating licence in the second quarter of 2019.
Legal Sishen consolidated mining right granted Sishens application to extend the mining right area to include the Dingleton properties through the inclusion of the adjacent Prospecting Rights was granted on 25 June 2017 and notarially executed on 29 June 2018.
The grant allows Sishen mine to expand its current mining operations within the adjacent Dingleton area.
Kolomela consolidated mining right granted The Section 102 application to amend the Kolomela mining right and the mining work programme to include Heuningkranz and portion 1 of Langverwacht was granted on 14 October 2018.
The environmental authorisation was approved on 7 November 2018.
The grant allows Kolomela mine to expand its current mining operations within the adjacent Heuningkranz area.
The transfer of Thabazimbi to ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited ArcelorMittal SA Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited SIOC andArcelorMittal SA entered into an agreement in 2016 totransfer Thabazimbi mine to ArcelorMittal SA, subject tothefulfilment of certain conditions precedent.
On 12October 2018, Kumba and ArcelorMittal SA announced that all the conditions precedent to the transfer of Thabazimbi mine, together with the mining rights, had either been fulfilled or waived.
The employees, assets and liabilities, as well as the mining rights and the assumed liabilities of the mine, were transferred at a nominal purchase consideration from SIOC to Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine Pty Ltd previously ArcelorMittal South Africa Operations Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ArcelorMittal SA, on 1 November 2018.
