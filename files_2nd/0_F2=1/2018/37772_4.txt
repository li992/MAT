The return to shareholders was also 25.5%, reflecting a stable discount versus the prior year.
Furthermore, this was a very strong year for income in the portfolio, which has supported the sizeable increase in dividend payable as announced.

This positive relative performance has been delivered from a combination of stock selection and sector allocation.
The charts overleaf show the relative contributions to performance for the best and worst ten stocks and sectors within the portfolio.
The positive contribution from both stock selection and sector allocation has been achieved across an extremely diverse range of individual stocks and sectors, as opposed to a limited number of significant wins.
The greatest contributing sector was financial services with success across a large number of holdings including most notably our position in Intermediate Capital, the debt investor.
The company generated strong returns as its fundraising momentum increased alongside better than forecast results from its proprietary investment portfolio.
The support services sector was also a significant contributor, with our avoidance of Capita, the outsourced services provider, adding significantly to our relative performance as the companys woes continued.
At an individual stock level Sophos, the IT security software provider that we invested in through its initial public offering in 2015, yielded a strong return.
It continued to deliver excellent billings growth and various high profile cyber breaches, including WannaCry, alerted the market to the tremendous long term growth potential in this area.

While at a sector level there were very few, at a stock level there were several holdings, including Dominos Pizza and Saga, where operational and financial performance did not meet either our or the markets expectations.
We have limited tolerance of such investments and neither of these feature in the portfolio today.
Having increased the level of gearing through the latter part of 2016, the portfolio benefited from the rising market and gearing peaked at 6% in March, before being reduced to 3.5% at the year end, having been at least fully invested i. e. 0% geared, throughout the year.
The benefit from being geared broadly offset the cost of the Companys debenture through the year.

Portfolio positioning and the year ahead where are the opportunities?
While we focus primarily on company specific analysis and stock selection, we remain mindful of the broader macro-economic conditions and trends that influence the relative attractiveness of different industries over time.
From that perspective this was a year of relative continuity, as changes in the aggregate shape and key end market exposures of the portfolio followed a consistent theme of increasing exposure to what we view to be improving industrial end markets, given the acceleration experienced in global economic growth.
This has been funded by reduced exposure to the consumer, who in our view has been stretched through a period of negative real wage growth and pressure on savings rates.
These changes can be seen in the charts overleaf, which show the change in make-up of the top and bottom ten sectors relative to benchmark through the year: there is a now greater preponderance of industrial sectors at the top of the list, while exposure to travel & leisure has been substantially reduced.
In tandem with this, the level of international relative to domestic exposure has also increased such that around 52% of revenue generated by companies in the portfolio is sourced internationally, up from around 49% a year ago.

At a stock level, additions to the portfolio have reflected specific opportunities.
For example, one of our largest new investments was in Electrocomponents, the international distributor of electronic components used by engineers across a hugely diverse set of applications.
The management teams restructuring work has translated into substantial improvements within the business, which are now driving a combination of improving growth, profitability and cash generation.
Another of our more material new investments was in Vesuvius, a provider of engineering products and services to the steel and foundry industries, which are inherently cyclical end markets, but where the outlook was improving from the cyclical trough.
The leadership team had managed the cost base very well through the down cycle, while positioning the business to benefit from any potential improvement in the end markets, which should result in a significant uplift in profit.
One of the greatest challenges in the market through the past year has been to avoid those companies, for example Capita, Dixons Carphone and Provident Financial, that fail to meet our or the markets expectations due to either internal or external factors and the markets response to such stocks is punitive.
While we fared well in this regard through 2017 and it added substantially to our relative performance, this may increase yet further in importance through the coming year.
Economic growth has displayed improving momentum across the globe for well over a year now, and while this is not being uniformly experienced, it has been translating into an improving backdrop for many companies in our investment universe.
In the UK specifically, growth has been less impressive, but has proved to be more resilient than feared by most commentators.
While this should provide a positive backdrop for equities, the markets will also have to grapple with a number of counterbalancing factors, not least of which may be the gradual removal of monetary stimulus as well as the implications of any potential increase in inflation.
Furthermore, the geopolitical landscape presents a host of risks, some of which could generate far-reaching challenges in the future but which have not yet caused a discernible The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2018 9 JPM Mercantile pp01 18. qxp 11 04 2018 11:06 Page 10 Strategic Report continued impact.
The lack of volatility in financial markets has been a surprise, but will not last forever, as we were reminded with the market correction through the second half of January and early February this year.
At this stage the portfolio remains modestly geared, which leaves us with plenty of capacity to take advantage of any market driven or company specific opportunities for further reinvestment.
We remain committed to identifying and investing in those companies that have strong business models, are suitably financed and are well placed to succeed.
The portfolio includes many innovative companies that are using advances in technology to both drive and profit from structural changes in their markets and we anticipate that the favourable dynamics of mediumand small-sized companies will continue to drive superior returns over the Guy Anderson long-term.
