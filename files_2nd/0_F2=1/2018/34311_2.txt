OUR RESULTS Highlights Another successful year for the Group, with our robust business model underpinning a strong financial performance and supporting the delivery of our strategy.
Continued strong funds growth Total discretionary funds grew by 11.2% to 37.6 billion driven by strong net funds inflows of 2.3 billion and positive investment markets, representing a 6.8% growth rate and well ahead of our 5.0% target.

We are on track to meet the 5 year discretionary growth target we set in 2015.
