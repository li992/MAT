Directors The Directors of the Company who were in office during the year and up to the date of signing the financial statements are listed below: } Jzsef Vradi } William A. Franke } John R. Wilson } Stephen L. Johnson } John McMahon } Thierry fide Preux } Simon Duffy } Guido Demuynck } Susan Hooper } Wioletta Rosolowska resigned with effect from 9 February 2018 Going concern Wizz Airs business activities, financial performance and financial position, together with factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are described in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 24.
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are described on pages 25 to 29.
Note 3 to the accounts sets out the Groups objectives, policies and procedures for managing its capital and provides details of the risks related to financial instruments held by the Group.
At 31 March 2018, the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 979.6 million while net current assets were 572.6 million.
Other than convertible debt with a balance of 26.9 million the Group has no significant external borrowings.
The Directors have reviewed financial forecasts including plans to finance future aircraft deliveries.
After making enquiries, the Directors have satisfied themselves that the Group is expected to be able to meet its commitments and obligations for at least the next twelve months from the date of signing this report.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Viability In accordance with provision C. 2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the prospects and the viability of the Group over a three-year period to March 2021.
The Directors have determined that the three-year period was the appropriate period because i Wizz Air has a fast expanding business which gives less certainty of certain key forecasting assumptions over a longer period: and ii the Groups strategic planning process traditionally covers three years.
Assessment of prospects The Groups prospects are assessed by management and the Board primarily through the strategic planning process.
This three-year plan takes into account the current position of the Group, includes the fully detailed annual operating plan for the financial year starting in this case for the year ending March 2019 and then, building on it, a sufficiently detailed bottom-up forecast for further two financial years.
The Board participates fully in the process by aligning the key assumptions and the topline financial targets, reviewing and approving the annual operating plan, and reviewing and acknowledging the three-year plan.
The plan takes into account the existing aircraft order book of the Group that defines a programmed growth for several years ahead.
Financing of future aircraft deliveries is already secured with lease contracts until the end of 2018.
The Directors believe that the growth assumptions are justified also from the demand side, as the Group continues to execute its core strategy that is to have lower cost than any of its competitors, and with low prices stimulate further demand for its services both in existing and new markets.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2018 66 GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Viability continued Assessment of viability Although the strategic plan reflects management and the Directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business, they have also tested the resilience of the business to unfavorable deviations of certain key variables from the base case scenario.
In defining these scenarios the Directors took into account the principal risks that could prevent the Group from delivering on its strategy and financial targets, as summarised on pages 25 to 29 in the Strategic Report.
As part of this assessment, the Directors made the following key assumptions caveats: } there will not be a prolonged grounding of a substantial portion of the aircraft fleet: and } with regards to the expected departure of the UK from the European Union, the terms of exit will be such that will allow the Group to continue to operate broadly the same network to from the UK as at present due also to the new UK airline entity established and successfully licensed by April 2018.
The Directors assessed the potential financial impacts of severe but plausible scenarios that the Group could experience.
The scenarios included significant increase in jet fuel prices, significant strengthening of the US Dollar and weakening of the British Pound to the Euro, decreasing unit revenues, increasing crew costs, and a combination of these factors.
While several risks can impact revenues, increased competition in key markets was considered the most important risk both in terms of likelihood and potential impact.
The results of the testing showed that, due to the strong competitive position, operating cash flows and existing reserves of the Group, it would be able to withstand the impact of these scenarios over the period of the financial forecasts.
Viability statement Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2021.
Disclosure of information to auditors The Directors at the date of approval of the financial statements confirmed that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware, and they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.
