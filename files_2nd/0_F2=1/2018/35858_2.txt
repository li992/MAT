It is a niche market IRON ORE with high barriers to entry, including LUMP PELLET FEED therequirement to beneficiate and PELLETS Fines 150m 6.8mm upgradethe iron ore and high capital From hematite ore, c. 70% of global costs to establish a full mine-to-port Pellets 10mm iron ore exports From magnetite, c. 8% of global exports pelletising operation.
Pellets are the Global benchmark for iron ore pricing Uniform in size and composition most productive source of iron ore a Agglomerated into sinter at the sinter c. 62-65% iron content plant of a steel mill before use in a steel mill can use.
Highest value form of iron ore since furnace.
The resultant operating cost pellets are the most efficient source causes fines to have a lower of iron for a steel furnace relative value Pellets reduce energy requirements, slag volumes and air emissions in the Lump 6.8mm 15mm steelmaking process while improving the From hematite.
