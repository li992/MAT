FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE Underlying EBITDA increased by 23% to $1,062 million Total platinumproduction metal in concentrate increased 2017: $866 million, largely as a result of a 13% increase by 4% to 2,484,700 ounces 2017: 2,397,400 ounces, while in the basket price driven by stronger prices for palladium, total palladium output was 3% higher at 1,610,800 ounces rhodium, ruthenium and nickel.
Unit costs increased by 2017: 1,557,400 ounces.

The platinum price Mogalakwenas platinum production increased by 7% to wasdriven lower, primarily by a decline in the share of 495,100 ounces 2017: 463,800 ounces, and palladium dieselengines in the European car sector.
Despite production increased by 6% to 540,900 ounces disappointing global car sales, tighter global emissions 2017:508,900 ounces through mining a higher grade regulation supported the prices of palladium and rhodium, areaas planned, as well as optimisation of the primary with their average price for the year increasing by 18% millatthe North concentrator plant which led to improved and102% respectively.

Anglo American plc Integrated Annual Report 2018 61 STRATEGIC REPORT PLATINUM GROUP METALS Platinum production from other operations decreased OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK by19% to 385,800 ounces 2017: 474,400 ounces 1 From 1 January 2019, Sibanye 4E material is no longer and palladium production by 10% to 267,600 ounces purchased as concentrate, but toll-treated, with the refined 2017:297,300 ounces, driven by the sale of Union mine metal returned to Sibanye.
As a result, platinum production toSiyanda Resources Siyanda on 1 February 2018, from metal in concentrate for 2019 is expected to belower which date Union production was purchased as concentrate.
Palladium Excluding Union, platinum production from other production metal in concentrate for 2019 is expected to operationsincreased by 17%, driven by PGMs share of be1.3-1.4 million ounces.
platinum production from joint operations increasing by 10% to 270,800 ounces 2017: 245,300 ounces and itsshare of palladium production increasing by 9% to 176,000ounces 2017: 161,500 ounces, as well as theacquisition of the remaining 50% of Mototolo on 1November 2018.
Purchase of concentrate Purchase of concentrate increased by 14% and 9% for platinum and palladium respectively.
The inclusion of concentrate from Union following the sale to Siyanda was partly offset by the removal of unprofitable ounces following the closure of Bokoni, which was placed onto care and maintenance in 2017.
Refined production Refined platinum production decreased by 4% to 2,402,400ounces 2017: 2,511,900 ounces, while refined palladium output decreased by 10% to 1,501,800 ounces 2017: 1,668,500 ounces.
The reduction was primarily attributable to the planned rebuild of Mortimer smelter in thesecond quarter of2018: the partial rebuild at Polokwane smelter which was completed during the second half of the year: commissioning of the Unki smelter in the third quarter: andmaintenance work on other processing assets, which collectively resulted in a build-up of work-in-progress inventory.
Furthermore, 2017 refined production included 130,000 platinum ounces and associated PGMs that weretoll-refined by a third party following the Waterval Furnace 1 run-out in 2016.
It is expected that the build-up of work-in-progress inventory will be processed in full during 2019.
Sales volumes Platinum sales volumes, excluding refined metals purchased from third parties, decreased by 3% to 2,424,200ounces 2017: 2,504,600 ounces, while palladium sales decreased by 4% to 1,513,100 ounces 2017: 1,571,700 ounces.
The overall decrease resultedfrom lower refined production, compensated in part by a drawdown in refined platinum inventory levels.
Incomparison, there were high sales volumes in 2017 owingtothe refining of the backlog of material from the Waterval smelter run-out in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1 Trading activities generated further sales volumes of Platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold.
