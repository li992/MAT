48 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2018 26332 14 March 2019 3:53 pm Proof 7 Bodycote AR2018 proof 6. indd 48 14 03 2019 15:55:42 Potential conflicts of interest During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not only had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose, but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real or potential.
Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation a Situational Conflict which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one company.
In order to ensure that each director was complying with the duties, each director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what Situational Conflicts affected him or her.
The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict up until September 2019 and permitted each affected director to attend and vote at Bodycote directors meetings, on the basis that each such director continued to keep Bodycotes information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate and in the interests of shareholders.
Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, the Chair or the Nomination Committee can revoke an authorisation.
No such revocations have been made.
Employment The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees.
The commitment of employees to excel is key to the Groups continued success.
