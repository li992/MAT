It is all about improving the customer experience, whether that be for internal or external users.
Like many businesses, we are starting on the journey of providing our customers with world-class experiences that help us retain their business and loyalty.
In 2018 we have delivered a number of projects that act as the bedrock for future activities.
Business Model on pages 14 and 15 Strategy on pages 18 and 19 Progress in 2018 E-platform A key area of focus in 2018 was the Commercial website and the infrastructure required to deliver better experiences for users.
The scope for 2018 was our Commercial product offering.
Customer research and testing informed the design and build of the website and highlighted the need for access to more imagery and detailed product data to aid specification of Marshalls products.
The challenge was to deliver a new Commercial website that is shaped around the customer rather than Marshalls.
Data is key to the website and considerable time has been invested in creating a central product data repository.
The website runs on state-of-the-art digital infrastructure, including third party software and minimal bespoke code, hosted in the cloud, independent of Marshalls internal infrastructure promoting our principle of agility.
Key points Commercial website has 300,000 pieces of data and over 12,000 images: Runs on a new digital infrastructure that provides us with greater agility and a blueprint for future systems architecture: Mobile optimised: and Ability to personalise content for different types of customers and use data to drive automated marketing campaigns.
This will assist in the creation of marketing qualified leads.
Artificial intelligence Voice Assistant Artificial intelligence is a technology that can emulate human behaviour by seeming to learn.
It will change the world and Marshalls has started to embrace it, making significant progress in the area of natural language processing.
By 2020 it is expected that 50 per cent of all searches will be voice searches.
Marshalls has created a voice application that will answer our most frequently asked questions via Google smart speaker home devices and their virtual assistant, which is available in Android and iOS app stores.
Key points The Marshalls Voice Assistant can respond to over 80 questions, asked in over 3,000 ways.
This will grow over time as the application is trained in more areas: It ensures the Marshalls brand is present in an emerging digital channel: and The framework can be extended to livechat via websites to enable out of hours support on the most frequently asked questions.
What the future holds Marshalls digital strategy and vision have started to deliver realised benefits in 2018 with a number of key milestones reached.
This groundwork will allow the business to accelerate the programme into 2019 and beyond.
The focus for 2019 will be around: Rolling out the new digital platform to more areas of the business, including the recently acquired businesses of CPM and Edenhall: The extension of the artificial intelligence framework to areas such as machine learning and further developing the natural language processing capabilities to support customers out of hours: and Leveraging cloud technology to modernise IT infrastructure by delivering increased agility, management and security.
