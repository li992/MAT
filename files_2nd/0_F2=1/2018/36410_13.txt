GPE occupational market positioning Whilst occupational demand is healthy and supply remains limited, the outlook remains challenging as occupiers navigate the continued uncertain outlook in a lower growth environment.
Moreover, while headline market rents were broadly stable over the year, the increase in typical rent free periods implies a marginal decline in net effective rents.
Against this backdrop, we are well positioned: our leasing record remains strong, our committed development programme is focused on high quality, well-located schemes that are in high demand, our average rents are low with further reversionary potential across the Group of 12.1% and 88% of our portfolio is within walking distance of a Crossrail station.

Investment activity in the central London commercial property market is robust and the real yield spread over gilt yields remains supportive resulting in stable prime investment yields.
In the medium term, we expect modest increases in yields and we expect this trend to be greater for secondary properties.
On the occupational side, business confidence remains low, forecast rates ofeconomic growth are modest and the uncertainty surrounding the UK exit from the EU has yet to clear.
