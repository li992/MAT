Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 131 Governance Directors report continued Other disclosures We reduce our carbon footprint The UK is playing a leading part in reducing carbon emissions.
We want to play our part in reducing our impact by reducing our carbon emissions.
As the majority of our carbon emissions are driven by our use of energy, managing carbon means managing costs.
We therefore aim to reduce carbon emissions and increase our generation of renewable energy.
We are achieving both of these aims, and this year we have seen another reduction in overall carbon emissions.
Weve seen a consistent reduction since 2002 when we began publicly reporting on our greenhouse gas emissions.
We have held the Carbon Trust Standard since 2009 in recognition of this achievement and weve been recertified to 2019.
We continue to report to the Carbon Disclosure Project CDP each year which means our climate change information is publicly accessible.
CDP request information about climate change from companies on behalf ofinvestors and score each company on the quality and completeness of their responses.
During this year, we again increased renewable energy generation and across Severn Trent we now generate an equivalent of 38% ofSevern Trent Water Limiteds electricity needs.
We continue to lead the UK water industry, with an aim of building on this position bygenerating the equivalent of 50% of our electricity needs by 2020.
We plan to continue to reduce our operational emissions by reducing our energy use and increase our renewable energy generation, mainly within Business Services.
Pursuing these measures will continue to reduce our key sources of emissions, reduce our reliance on the electricity grid and bring financial benefits for our customers and investors.
Report on greenhouse gas emissions This is the fifth year Severn Trent has been required to report greenhouse gas GHG emissions in the Directors report.
Severn Trent is committed to reducing its GHG emissions.
For Severn Trent Water Limited, which accounts for 99% of our total Group emissions, we have been publicly reporting on our emissions since 2002.
In that time we have reduced our emissions by being more energy efficient and generating more renewable energy.
Our GHG emissions are reported in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tCO e, for the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018.
2 Our total net emissions have fallen again this year, due to our increased generation of renewable energy, a reduction in the emissionsintensity of UK grid electricity and reduced fuel and process emissions.
The sale of our US business has reduced our emissions outside the UK.
The GHG data we report is reported internally during the year to the Corporate Responsibility Committee and to the Board.
We have subjected our GHG data and processes to external assurance by Jacobs.

In accordance with the reporting regulations, we have not reported on emissions we can influence, but which we are not responsible for, referred to as indirect emissions.
We have used the location based methodology rather than the more recentlyintroduced market-based method to account for use of grid electricity in order to ensure consistency with previous years.
For the appointed UK Water businesses Severn Trent Water Limited and Dee Valley Water Limited, we have calculated our emissions using the Carbon accounting in the UK Water Industry: methodology for estimating operational emissions, Version 12 released April 2018.
This is a peer-reviewed calculation tool developed and used by all the major water companies in the UK.
It is updated each year to include the latest available emissions factors.
For Severn Trent Services, we have used the latest Defra emissions factors which include the relevant conversion factors for overseas electricity.
