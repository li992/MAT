TheBODsconsider that, within the DLCarrangement, the most appropriate presentation of Carnival plcs viability is byreference to the consolidated viability of Carnival Corporation & plc.
Accordingly, this Viability Statement presents the combined group and the BODshave assessed the prospects of Carnival Corporation & plc over a longer period than the twelve months required bythe going concern basis of preparation.
Whilst the BODs have noreason to believe Carnival Corporation & plc will not be viable over a longer period, the period over which the BODsconsidered viability is three years.
Theprincipal reasons whythis period wasselected are as follows: It aligns with managements strategic planning cycle Management plans its guest sourcing and ship itinerary strategies over a twoto three year horizon TheCarnival Corporation & plc three-year financial plan considers the following factors, among others: Net revenue yields Net cruise costs per ALBDexcluding fuel Fuel price Foreign exchange rates Operating income Operating income per ALBD Earnings per share Liquidity Return oninvested capital Certain of these items were subject to sensitivity analysis both individually and in unison.
Where appropriate, this analysis wascarried out to evaluate the potential impact of Carnival Corporation & plcs principal risks actually occurring.
In addition, the three-year financial plan makes certain assumptions about newship orders, improvements and disposals that are likely to occur during the financial plan period, and considers the committed export credit financings that are associated with the ship deliveries.
Furthermore, based onCarnival Corporation & plcs historical results, projections and financial condition, the BODsbelieve that the companys future operating cash flows and liquidity will be sufficient to fund all of its expected capital improvements, newship growth capital, debt maturities and dividend payments.
This belief is supported bythe following factors, among others: Carnival Corporation & plc had liquidity of $14.6billion at November 30,2018consisting of $710million of cash and cash equivalents, which excludes $271million of cash used for current operations, $2.3billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities, net of our outstanding commercial paper borrowing, and $11.5billion under our committed future financings, which are comprised of ship export credit facilities Carnival Corporation & plcs primary financial goals include maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong investment grade credit ratings Carnival Corporation & plc is the worlds largest leisure travel company and among the most profitable and financially strong in the cruise and vacation industries Based onthe above, the BODsrisk appetite and howthese risks are managed or mitigated, the BODshave a reasonable expectation that Carnival Corporation & plc will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.
