Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 04 FERREXPO AT A GLANCE CONTINUED 02 Ferrexpos significant magnetite resource base is situated along a single ore body, which allows for efficient expansion through brownfield developments LONG-LIFE Magnetite ore allows for isolation of iron units so as to produce a uniform and high iron content product.
Magnetite ore is exothermic which reduces energy RESOURCE BASE requirements and lowers costs.

The ore reserves estimates for the GPL deposits were calculated based on a review conducted by Turgis DHV Mining Consultants in May 2009 less the volume of ore mined from GPL deposits between May 2009 and 31 December 2018.
The ore reserve estimates are based on a report by Royal Haskoning DHV dated September 2013.
The ore reserves estimates for Yerystivske deposit has been depleted in line with the volume of ore mined between September 2013 and 31 December 2018.
