Group operating costs before transformation costs increased by 650 million.
This was due mainly to the IAS 19 pension charge in UKPIL and volume-related increases in GLS semi-variable costs.
Operating specific items decreased by 77 million see paragraph entitled Specific items and pension charge to cash difference adjustment' on pages 27 to 28.
Group operating profit decreased by 153 million to 66 million largely as a result of the increase to the IAS 19 pension charge.
Profit before tax decreased to 212 million.
Of the profit, UKPIL accounted for 39 million 2016-17: 183 million while GLS contributed 173 million 2016-17: 152 million.
Basic earnings per share decreased from 27.5 pence to 25.9 pence.
A full reconciliation of reported to adjusted results is set out in the section entitled Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures on pages 34 to 35.

The difference between the pension charge and cash cost largely comprises the difference between the relevant IAS 19 income statement pension charge rate of 41.1 per cent 2016-17: 28.8 per cent and the actual cash payment agreed with the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP Trustee of 17.1 per cent of pensionable pay 2016-17: 17.1 per cent.
As a result of the introduction of the Defined Benefit Cash Balance Scheme DBCBS from 1 April 2018, the IAS 19 pension service charge rate for 2018-19 is projected to decrease to 18.9 per cent and the cash contribution rate will decrease to 15.6 per cent.
As a result, the pension charge to cash difference adjustment for 2018-19 is expected to reduce significantly to around 90 million.
Operating specific items in the year related mainly to the Employee Free Shares charge of 33 million 2016-17: 105 million.
This decreased as a result of the Share Incentive Plan SIP 2013 maturing in October 2016, partially offset by the charge in relation to the Free Shares awarded in October 2016 SIP 2016.
The Employee Free Shares charge is expected to be around 26 million for 2018-19.
This reflects the phasing of the charge over the vesting period.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 16 million 2016-17: 11 million related mainly to the acquisitions by GLS.
Legacy costs in the prior year were driven by a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the industrial diseases provision and the legislative decrease in the discount rate used to determine personal injury claims announced in February 2017.
Other specific items mainly related to the integration of Romec into the Group.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 | 27 Royal Mail plc | Group results Non-operating specific items included a profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 71 million 2016-17: 14 million.
This arose due largely to the 24 million overage payment in respect of the sale of Rathbone Place in 2011, 22 million from the completion of the sale of the Phoenix Place plot at Mount Pleasant and the 20 million overage payment in respect of the sale of the Paddington Mail Centre in 2014.
The profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment in the prior year related mainly to the sale of a GLS property in Munich and the Maidstone Delivery Office.
The loss on disposal of business in the prior year related to the sale of NDC 2000 Limited NDC and reflected the transfer of cash and other assets to the purchasers.
The net pension interest credit of 91 million 2016-17: 120 million was lower than the prior year.
This was due to the lower discount rate and lower surplus for 2017-18 compared with 2016-17.
The net pension interest for 2018-19 in relation to RMPP and RMSEPP is expected to be around 80 million due to the lower pension surplus position at 25 March 2018 compared to 26 March 2017.
Net finance costs Reported net finance costs were 16 million 2016-17: 16 million comprising largely interest on the 500 million bond of 11 million 2016-17: 11 million.

The retranslation impact of the 500 million bond is accounted for within equity.

The UK adjusted effective tax rate of 16 per cent 2016-17: 19 per cent was lower than the prior year due to catch ups on patent box claims and the reduction in the UK statutory rate from 20 per cent to 19 per cent in 2017-18.
The GLS adjusted effective tax rate of 28 per cent 2016-17: 28 per cent was consistent with the prior year.
The Group reported tax was a credit of 46 million on a reported profit before tax of 212 million.
This was due mainly to the one-off deferred tax credit of 78 million which is a result of the closure of the RMPP to future accrual after 31 March 2018 and profits made on the disposal of properties which, for tax purposes, are offset by reinvestment relief.
The one-off deferred tax credit was due to the change to the previous assumption that the surplus would be recoverable from a reduction in contributions at some point in the future, which would have been taxed at the corporate tax rate.
It is now assumed that the majority of the surplus will be available through a refund, net of withholding tax.
This withholding tax is a charge on the pension scheme and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income by application of the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC 14 guidance.
This one-off tax credit is an accounting adjustment with no cash benefit to the Company.
Excluding this one-off deferred tax credit, the total Group reported tax in the income statement would change from a credit of 46 million to a charge of 32 million.
Earnings per share EPS Adjusted basic EPS for continuing operations was 45.5 pence compared with 44.1 pence in the prior year.
This largely reflected the decrease in transformation costs.

This was mainly due to the growth in adjusted EBITDA before transformation costs, positive movements in trading working capital and a decrease in total investment.
Trading working capital inflow of 74 million was 77 million higher than the prior year.
It benefited from the timing of the settlement of the 2017-18 frontline pay award of 101 million, which was paid in the first quarter of 2018-19.
This was partially offset by 15 million higher bonus payments relating to 2016-17 and higher terminal dues payments in the first half associated with the growth in export volumes seen in the second half of 2016-17.
Income tax paid was 15 million higher than the prior year due to GLS tax payments.

Growth capital expenditure increased by 34 million as a result of continued investment in strategic projects in UKPIL and GLS.
They included operations modernisation, parcel IT systems and parcel innovation projects.
Replacement capital expenditure reduced by 61 million.
This was driven by the completion of the IT transformation programme and lower property refurbishments.
Transformation operating expenditure was 17 million lower, due to the industrial relations environment affecting the pace of change and voluntary redundancies in the year.
The proceeds from disposals of property excluding London Development Portfolio, plant and equipment related to the 24 million overage for Rathbone Place, 14 million from the sale of various smaller Mail Centres and Delivery Offices and 2 million from the sale of vehicles.
The cash payment from the 20 million overage due on the sale of the Paddington Mail Centre was received in April 2018.
Net cash debt The Group had a net cash position of 14 million at 25 March 2018.
This compares with a net debt position of 338 million at 26 March 2017.
The net cash position benefitted by 101 million from the timing of the settlement of the 2017-18 frontline pay award.
This was paid in the first quarter of 2018-19.
2 We have reclassified 18 million of growth capital expenditure in the prior year as replacement capital expenditure and 1 million of project costs as voluntary redundancy cash payments to more accurately reflect the nature of these cash investments.

The amount held at 25 March 2018 was 24 million 26 March 2017: 22 million.
The cash cost of operating specific items was an outflow of 12 million due to employer National Insurance contributions on the SIP 2013 and 2014 employee share sales, industrial disease settlements and Romec business integration costs.
The cash costs of operating specific items in the prior year largely comprised the French Competition Authority fine of 55 million paid in April 2016, as disclosed in 2015-16.
Proceeds from disposal of property excluding London Development Portfolio, plant and equipment of 40 million is explained in the paragraph entitled Net cash investment on page 29.
Cash inflow relating to the London Development Portfolio was 10 million.
Infrastructure and enabling works costs of 33 million on the Nine Elms and Mount Pleasant sites were offset by 43 million of receipts in relation to the two Mount Pleasant plots.
Debt transferred on acquisitions relates to 3 million of interest bearing loans and borrowings on GLS acquisitions.
The impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements reduced compared with the prior year.
The exchange rate against Sterling in the prior year was affected by the reaction to the outcome of the EU referendum.
It has subsequently remained relatively consistent.
The 53 million cash outflow in the prior year was in relation to the Company purchasing its own shares in advance of the Save As You Earn SAYE options exercised this year.
Cash payments of 28 million were received from employees exercising their SAYE options to purchase company shares this year.
Acquisition of business interests in the year largely related to the acquisition of Postal Express and Redyser by GLS.
The acquisition of business interests in the prior year related to the acquisitions of GSO and ASM by GLS and eCourier by UKPIL.
The acquisition of non-controlling interests in the prior year was mainly in respect of the Romec business.

Management proposes actions which reflect the Groups investment plans and risk characteristics as well as the macro-economic conditions in which we operate.
The Board keeps this policy under constant review to ensure that capital is allocated to achieve our stated objective of delivering sustainable shareholder value.
Objectives Enablers 2017-18 Update Meet the Groups obligations as they fall due Maintaining sufficient cash reserves and committed At 25 March 2018, the Group had available resources of facilities to 1,650 million 2016-17: 1,317 million : made up of cash and meet all obligations, including pensions: and cash equivalents of 600 million 2016-17: 299 million and manage future risks, including those set out in the Principal undrawn committed revolving credit facilities of 1,050 million Risks section on pages 40 to 45 2016-17: 1,018 million.
The Group met the loan covenants and other obligations for its revolving credit facility and 500 million bond.
As set out in the Viability Statement, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Support a progressive dividend policy Generate sufficient in-year trading cash flow to cover the Generated 545 million of in-year trading cash flow 2016-17: ordinary dividend.
Maintain sufficient distributable reserves to 420 million to cover the full year dividend of 24.0 pence sustain the Groups dividend policy per share 2016-17: 23.0 pence per share equivalent to 240 million.
In-year trading cash flow benefitted by 101 million due to the timing of the cash payment of the 2017-18 frontline pay award.
Capital managed by the Group, excluding the net assets of the pension scheme, is 2,274 million 2016-17: 1,806 million.
The Group had retained earnings of 4,381 million at 25 March 2018 2016-17: 4,940 million.
The Group considers it has a maximum level of distributable reserves of around 2 billion which excludes the impact of the pension surplus on retained earnings, more than sufficient to cover the dividend.
Reduce the cost of capital for the Group Target investment grade standard credit metrics i. e. no lower During the year, the Group maintained a credit rating of BBB than BBBunder Standard & Poors rating methodology with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors.
Retain sufficient flexibility to invest in the Funded by retained cash flows and manageable levels of debt During the year, the Group made total gross investments of future of the business consistent with our target credit rating 485 million 2016-17: 529 million and acquisition of business interests and non-controlling interests of 18 million 2016-17: 144 million while retaining sufficient capital headroom.
Pensions Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP As previously announced, the RMPP in its previous Defined Benefit pension form, closed to future accrual after 31 March 2018.
The legal right to benefit from any surplus in the Plan has not changed as a result of this decision.
Therefore, only one week of economic benefit is recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions at 25 March 2018, with the remaining surplus assumed to be available as a refund.
This has resulted in a change to the tax treatment of the economic benefit of the surplus.
Following guidance from IFRIC 14, the accounting surplus has been adjusted downwards by 1,134 million 2016-17: nil million as a result of this change.
This represents the taxation that would be withheld on the surplus amount.
The pre IFRIC 14 accounting surplus of the RMPP at 25 March 2018 was 3,250 million, comprising assets of 9,939 million and liabilities of 6,689 million.
The reduction in the pre IFRIC 14 accounting surplus of 558 million, compared with the position at 26 March 2017, is mainly the result of the additional benefits accrued over the period being greater than the contributions paid during the period.
After the IFRIC 14 adjustment, the accounting surplus of the RMPP was 2,116 million at 25 March 2018.
This is an accounting adjustment with no cash benefit to the Company.
It was agreed between the Company and the Trustee in May 2017 that the Company would continue to contribute 17.1 per cent of pensionable pay until 31 March 2018.
It was subsequently agreed with the Trustee that the employer contributions payable in respect of the period 1 September 2017 to 31 March 2018 would be held in pension escrow investments for the benefit of members.
In 2018-19, the IAS 19 pension service cost rate in respect of members service up to 31 March 2018 i. e. for one week will be charged to the income statement at 41.0 per cent after which there will be no further IAS 19 pension service costs or regular cash contributions in respect of the RMPP.
There will still be a pension interest income cost in respect of RMPP and the assets and liabilities will still be shown on the balance sheet.
The RMPP will still be subject to triennial actuarial valuations.
The actuarial funding position at 31 March 2018 will not be known until the actuarial valuation has been agreed between the Trustee and the Company, with the results being very sensitive to the assumptions adopted at that date.
However, based on the rolled forward assumptions used for the March 2015 valuation, the RMPP actuarial surplus at 31 March 2018 was estimated to be 100 million 31 March 2017: 1,074 million.
There is no cash benefit to the Company from this current actuarial surplus.
Any actuarial surplus will remain in the RMPP for the benefit of members until the point at which all benefits have been paid out or secured.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 | 31 Royal Mail plc | Group results Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP Based on the rolled forward assumptions used for the March 2015 valuation, the RMSEPP actuarial surplus at 31 March 2018 was estimated to be 36 million 31 March 2017: 8 million, comprising assets of 479 million and liabilities of 443 million.
The RMSEPP closed in December 2012 to future accrual and the Company makes no regular future service contributions.
In accordance with the new Schedule of Contributions agreed for the period 29 March 2018 to 31 March 2025, deficit payments of 10 million per annum are due to be paid for the period up to 31 March 2018 resulting in a final amount of 1 million being paid in 2018-19, together with 1 million per annum for the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2025 in respect of the death-in-service lump sum benefits and administration expenses.
Transitional arrangements Royal Mail and the CWU have agreed to work together to introduce a Collective Defined Contribution CDC scheme with a Defined Benefit Lump Sum Scheme DBLSS sitting alongside it, subject to the necessary legislative and regulatory changes.
This would provide one scheme for all Royal Mail employees and would be the first of its type in the UK.
The Company has put in place transitional arrangements from 1 April 2018 while it lobbies Government to make the necessary legislative and regulatory changes to enable a CDC scheme.
As part of these transitional changes, the Company has implemented a new Defined Benefit Cash Balance Scheme DBCBS within the RMPP, and an improved Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan RMDCP.
Defined Benefit Cash Balance Scheme DBCBS RMPP members have automatically started building up DBCBS benefits from 1 April 2018.
If preferred, RMPP members can opt to join the improved RMDCP instead of the DBCBS.
Under the DBCBS, the Company guarantees a minimum lump sum at age 65, based on Company and member contributions.
The DBCBS will aim to provide increases to the lump sum each year, depending on investment performance.
The DBCBS will be accounted for as a defined benefit scheme and in a similar way to the RMPP.
Specifically, the assets and liabilities that will build up from the start of the scheme will be shown on the balance sheet.
IAS 19 pension service charge rates based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds and inflation at the start of the year will be charged to the income statement.
Pension interest will be calculated on the assets and liabilities at the end of 2018-19 for inclusion in the income statement from 2019-20 onwards.
The scheme will be subject to triennial valuations.
Under the DBCBS, the Company will contribute 15.6 per cent of DBCBS pensionable pay to the scheme.
Of this, 13.6 per cent will go to the members guaranteed lump sum.
The remaining two per cent of the Companys contribution will go to the cost of other member benefits, including death in service and ill-health benefits.
Members will contribute six per cent including Pension Salary Exchange contributions where the Group makes additional employee pension contributions in return for a reduction in basic pay.
The IAS 19 pension service cost rate is 18.9 per cent for 2018-19.
The pension charge is greater than the cash contribution rate as there is an assumed constructive obligation for annual pension benefit increases of CPI plus two per cent.
This means that the pension charge to cash difference adjustment for 2018-19 is expected to reduce significantly to around 90 million.
Improved Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan RMDCP Under the RMDCP, Company contributions have increased by one percentage point in each tier, up to a maximum of ten per cent.
Current and future RMDCP members in the standard section will contribute at the highest contribution tier unless they opt to contribute at a lower level.
RMDCP members with a minimum of five years service, including four years continuous service at the standard level of contribution, can instead choose to join the DBCBS.
Assuming that all RMPP and eligible RMDCP members join the DBCBS, the Company expects to contribute around 350 million in the 2018-19 financial year in respect of RMPP, RMSEPP and DBCBS with employees expected to contribute around 135 million.
The Company expects to contribute around 50 million to the RMDCP.
Total employer contributions in respect of all pension schemes would therefore be around 400 million.
Collective Defined Contribution CDC scheme and Defined Benefit Lump Sum Scheme DBLSS Based on current intentions and legislation, the CDC will be accounted for as a defined contribution scheme with the Group's contributions being charged to operating profit in the year to which the contributions relate.
The CDC scheme will have fixed employer contributions of 13.6 per cent and employee contributions of six per cent.
Investment and longevity risk will be pooled between members and will target but not guarantee the benefit the employee will receive in retirement.
No benefit guarantees are underwritten by the employer.
The DBLSS will be accounted for as a defined benefit scheme with the accounting treatment expected to be similar to the transitional DBCBS.
Dividends The final dividend of 15.6 pence per ordinary share in respect of the 2016-17 financial year was paid on 28 July 2017, following shareholder approval.
The interim dividend of 7.7 pence per ordinary share in respect of the 2017-18 financial year was paid on 10 January 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 December 2017.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 16.3 pence per ordinary share, payable on 31 August 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 27 July 2018, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 19 July 2018.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 24.0 pence.
As previously stated, given the seasonality of the Groups business, the Board would expect to pay an interim dividend each year equal to approximately one-third of the prior years total dividend and to set the final dividend for each year in light of the full year performance of the Group in line with the progressive dividend policy.
32 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Financial risks and related hedging The Group is exposed to commodity price and currency risk.
The Group operates hedging policies which are stated in the Notes to the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18.
The forecast diesel and jet commodity exposures in UKPIL are set out below together with the sensitivity of 2018-19 operating profit to changes in commodity prices and fuel duty.

Without hedging, the associated cost would be 9 million higher based upon closing fuel prices at 25 March 2018.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to interest payments on the 500 million bond, certain obligations under Euro denominated finance leases, trading with overseas postal administrations and various purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency.
GLS functional currency is the Euro which results in translational exposure to revenue, costs and operating profit.
The average exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro was 1:1.13, representing a five per cent weakening in Sterling compared with 1:1.19 in 2016-17.
This resulted in a 9 million increase in GLS reported operating profit before tax in 2017-18.
The impact of foreign exchange transactions in the UK was not material in 2017-18.
The net impact on Group operating profit before tax was 8 million.
The Group manages its interest rate risk through a combination of fixed rate loans and leasing, floating rate loans facilities and floating rate financial investments.
