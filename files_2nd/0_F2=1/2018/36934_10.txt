We have a strong balance sheet and an attractive cash conversion model, resulting in excess free cash post investment in organic capex and payment of dividends.
We look to utilise this strong position to grow the business inorganically, investing in value-accretive acquisitions that will ensure longer-term growth of the business and value for shareholders.
Beyond this we will look to return any excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks.
