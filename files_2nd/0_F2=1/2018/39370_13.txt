focus on safety, productivity and sustainability.
Arnaud Soirat Chief executive, Copper & Diamonds Copper Global demand for copper is set to grow, driven by urbanisation, industrialisation and increasing requirements for renewable energy: copper plays a key role in electrification and power production.
For example, a wind turbine capable of generating a megawatt of power enough to supply several hundred homes needs more than three tonnes of copper.
Our copper operations around the world are at various stages in the mining lifecycle, from exploration to rehabilitation.
We supply 3 2 customers in China, Japan and the US.
copper operations in the copper growth projects Oyu Tolgoi, our mine in Mongolia, has reserves US, Mongolia and Chile in the US and Mongolia and resources that make it one of the worlds largest known copper and gold deposits.
When working to full capacity, it will be the worlds third-biggest copper mine.
2 1st Diamonds diamond operations mining company to be In diamonds, we are a fully integrated global in Canada and Australia certified by the Responsible exploration, mining and sales and marketing business.
We are one of the worlds largest Jewellery Council producers of rough diamonds from our two mines Argyle in Australia and Diavik in Canada.
We provide a reliable supply of white and coloured 16 250,000 diamonds mined to the highest possible ethical countries with copper pounds of copper scrap and environmental standards.
As a founding member of The Responsible Jewellery Council, exploration programmes recycled each month at we support responsible and ethical social and Kennecott Copper Mine in environmental practices throughout the jewellery supply chain.
We are also members of the World the US, now in its 115th year Diamond Council and the Diamond Producers 8,500 Association which uphold the reputation of employees diamond miners as careful custodians of these natural treasures.
