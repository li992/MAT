The Company has been pursuing a senior debt financing with a group of prospective lenders since 2016.
This was most recently adjusted on 22 January 2019 to focus on a US$3 billion multitranche structure.
The Alternative Proposal contains an alternative senior debt structure to completely replace that structure.
TheCompany believes that the Alternative Proposal potentially offers a more flexible and attractive solution to its stage 2 financing requirements and therefore it is pausing discussions with its existing prospective lenders to pursue the Alternative Proposal.
A number of options for the additional non-senior debt financing requirement, as previously outlined in the Companys announcement of 6 September 2018, continue to be progressed.
The Company is working towards obtaining firm commitments for the Alternative Proposal and its additional financing requirements before the end of May 2019.

72 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Value Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information CEO pay increase in relation to all employees The table below sets out the percentage change in base salary, value of taxable benefits and bonus for the Chief Executive Officer between 2017 and 2018 compared with the average percentage change for employees representing the wider workforce between 2017 and 2018.
Chief Executive Wider 1 Percentage change Officer workforce Salary 0% 4% 2 Taxable benefits 0% 5.6% Annual bonus 42.6% 51% Notes: 1.
In order for the comparisons to be meaningful, the group of employees selected for the wider workforce comprised: 1 in relation to salary, those employees who were with the business in both 2017 and 2018 and, accordingly, were eligible for a salary review in 2018: 2 in relation to taxable benefits, those employees who received taxable benefits in 2017 and those employees who received taxable benefits in 2018 other than benefits related to JOE awards, as described below : and 3 in relation to bonuses, those employees who were eligible for a bonus in both 2017 and 2018.
These groups have been selected in order to provide a meaningful comparison and so that remuneration between 2017 and 2018 can be viewed on a like-for-like basis.
Benefits provided to the CEO and to other employees who receive JOE awards include the payment by the Company of the income tax and employee National Insurance contributions due in respect of the award of JOE awards under the LTIP.
Because these benefits relate to the value of the long-term incentive awards granted to the CEO and other employees, they are excluded for the purposes of this analysis as, in the opinion of the Committee, their inclusion would not result in meaningful disclosure of the increase in the benefits.

The median, 25th and 75th percentile pay ratios were calculated using thefull time equivalent total remuneration for all UK employees as at 31 December 2018, using the same methodology that is used tocalculate the CEO single figure of remuneration as defined on page 64.
For the purpose of calculating the total remuneration, afull-time equivalent was defined as 37.5 hours per week.
No component was omitted from the calculation and this is the first year thatwe have published the CEO pay ratio.
Pay details for the individuals are set out below: 25th 75th CEO percentile Median percentile Salary 475,000 33,000 41,000 86,000 Total remuneration 970,729 33,600 56,170 109,438 The majority of our wider workforce are eligible to participate in both the annual bonus and the LTIP.
This is in line with our ethos of recognising the importance of our strong team culture, the contribution of the wider team and ensuring that incentives for the wider employee population remain aligned to the interests of shareholders.
The Group aims to provide a competitive remuneration package which is appropriate to promote the long-term success of the Company and apply this policy fairly and consistently to attract and motivate staff.
Our ratios shown above reflect fair and consistent pay for the Executive Directors and wider workforce generally.
In assessing our pay ratios versus ratios from companies that have disclosed their pay ratios early, we believe that we are towards the lower end of the range but there may be some differences in the calculation methods that are used.
Our CEO single figure comprises of only fixed pay, taxable benefits, pension benefits and bonus, given that no long-term incentive vested in respect of performance in 2018.
It should be noted that given the nature of the Companys milestone-based LTIPs, the ratio is likely to change significantly if awards vest in future years.
