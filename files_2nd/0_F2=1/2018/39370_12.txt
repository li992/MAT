Strategic report | Business reviews Aluminium We lead the industry in responsible aluminium, working We are a global leader in aluminium, with our customers with large-scale, high-quality bauxite mines and alumina refineries and, to meet growing inCanada, technologically advanced, low-cost smelters producing consumer demand.
Alf Barrios Through our integrated portfolio of mines, refineries and smelters, we source bauxite and Chief executive, Aluminium produce alumina and aluminium.
Managing the process from start to finish allows us to bring quality products to our customers efficiently, carefully calibrated to meet their specific and changing needs from sustainably sourced aluminium to new, lighter alloys for the automotive industry.
