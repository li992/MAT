Royal Mail plc | Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs The Group uses certain Alternative Performance Measures APMs in its financial reporting that are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP under which the Group produces its statutory financial information.
These APMs are not a substitute, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance.
They are used as Management considers them to be an important means of comparing performance year-on-year and are key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
APMs should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute to, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.
Where appropriate, reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measure have been provided.
The APMs used may not be directly comparable with similarly titled APMs used by other companies.
Reported to Adjusted results The Group makes adjustments to results reported under IFRS to exclude specific items and the IAS 19 pension charge to cash difference adjustment see definitions in the paragraph entitled Alternative performance measures.
Management believes this is a more meaningful basis upon which to analyse the business performance in particular given the volatile nature of the IAS 19 charge and is consistent with the way financial performance is reported to the Board.
IFRS can have the impact of causing high levels of volatility in reported earnings which do not relate to changes in the operational performance of the Company.
Management has reviewed the long-term differences between reported and adjusted profit after tax.
Cumulative reported profit after taxation for the six years ended 25 March 2018 was 2,890 million compared with cumulative adjusted profit after tax of 2,269 million.
Annual reported profit after tax showed a range of 222 million to 1,280 million.
The principal cause of the difference and volatility is due to pension-related accounting.
Further details on specific items excluded are included in the paragraph entitled Specific items and pension charge to cash difference adjustment on pages 27 to 28.
A reconciliation showing the adjustments made between reported and adjusted group results can be found in the paragraph entitled Consolidated reported and adjusted results reconciliation on pages 34 to 35.
Underlying change Movements compared with prior year in volumes, revenue, costs, profits and margins are shown on an underlying basis.
Underlying movements improve comparability between periods by making adjustments to the prior year to take into account differences in working days in UKPIL and movements in foreign exchange in GLS.
We only adjust for items with an impact greater than 10 million.
We have not adjusted for transactional foreign exchange movements in UKPIL this year as the impact of 1 million was below the threshold.
In addition, adjustments are made for non-recurring or distorting items, which by their nature may be unpredictable, such as the first year impact of acquisitions and changes in legislation such as the Apprenticeship Levy.
For volumes, underlying movements are adjusted for working days in UKPIL and the first year impact of acquisitions.
It also excludes political parties election mailings in addressed letter volume movements.
The paragraph entitled Underlying change adjustments on page 39 provides further details on the adjustments we have made to the prior year to calculate the underlying change.

They are presented before and after transformation costs, to provide Management with a view of the ongoing impact of the costs of transforming the business.
Reported operating profit This measure is in accordance with IFRS and is a means by which Management can understand the financial performance of the Group.
It is based on reported profit after transformation costs see above including operating specific items.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 | 35 Royal Mail plc | Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs Adjusted operating profit before and after transformation costs These measures are based on reported operating profit before and after transformation costs see above further adjusted to exclude the volatility of the pension charge to cash difference adjustment, which Management considers to be a key adjustment in understanding the underlying profit of the Group at this level.
Adjusted operating profit This measure is based on reported operating profit see above excluding the pension charge to cash difference adjustment and operating specific items, which Management considers to be key adjustments in understanding the underlying profit of the Group at this level.
These adjusted measures are reconciled to the reported results in the table in the paragraph entitled Consolidated reported and adjusted results reconciliation on pages 34 to 35.
Definitions of operating costs, the pension charge to cash difference adjustment, transformation costs and operating specific items are provided below.
Adjusted operating profit margin after transformation costs This is a fundamental measure of performance that Management uses to understand the efficiency of the business in generating profit.
It calculates adjusted operating profit after transformation costs as a proportion of revenue in percentage terms.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA before transformation costs Reported EBITDA before transformation costs is reported operating profit before transformation costs with depreciation, amortisation and share of associate company profits added back.
Adjusted EBITDA before transformation costs is reported EBITDA before transformation costs with the pension charge to cash difference adjustment added back.
EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of operating performance because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation, amortisation and the performance of associate companies.
The following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA before transformation costs to reported operating profit before transformation costs.

A reconciliation of this number to reported basic earnings per share is included in the adjusted results table in the section entitled Presentation of results.
People costs These are costs incurred in respect of the Groups employees and comprise wages and salaries, pensions and social security costs.
Distribution and conveyance costs These costs relate to non-people costs incurred in transporting and delivering mail by rail, road, sea and air including terminal dues and driver sub-contractor costs.
Infrastructure costs These are costs primarily relating to the day-to-day operation of the delivery network and include depreciation and amortisation, IT and property facilities management costs.
Other operating costs These are any operating costs which do not fall into the categories of people costs, distribution and conveyance costs or infrastructure costs including for example, Post Office Limited agency costs, consumables and training.
Transformation costs These costs relate to the ongoing transformation of the business, including management time and costs associated with the cost avoidance programme, and other projects with the aim of making our operations more efficient or improving our customer offering.
They also include voluntary redundancy and other termination costs.
Pension charge to cash difference adjustment This adjustment represents the difference between the IFRS income statement pension charge rate of 41.1 per cent and the actual cash payments into the RMPP at 17.1 per cent.
Management believes this adjustment is appropriate in order to eliminate the volatility of the IAS 19 accounting charge and to include only the true cash cost of the pension plans in the adjusted operating profit of the Group.
Operating specific items These are recurring or non-recurring items of income or expense of a particular size and or nature relating to the operations of the business that, in Managements opinion, require separate identification.
Management does not consider them to be reflective of year-on-year operating performance.
These include items that have resulted from events that are non-recurring in nature, even though related income expense can be recognised in subsequent periods.
36 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Employee Free Shares charge These relate to accounting charges arising from the granting of free shares to employees upon the Governments sales of its stake in the business SIP 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 with no direct cash impact on the Group.
Amortisation of intangible assets in acquisitions These notional charges, which arise as a direct consequence of IFRS business combination accounting requirements, are separately identified as Management does not consider these costs to be directly related to the trading performance of the Group.
Legacy other costs These costs relate either to unavoidable ongoing costs arising from historic events industrial diseases provision or restructuring costs Romec integration.
Non-operating specific items These are recurring or non-recurring items of income or expense of a particular size and or nature which do not form part of the Groups trading activity and in Managements opinion require separate identification.
Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment PP&E Management separately identifies recurring profit loss on disposal of PP&E as these disposals are not part of the Groups trading activity and are driven primarily by business strategy.
Profit loss on disposal of business These non-recurring events are excluded on the basis that by their nature they are individually unique and therefore distort comparison of year-on-year business performance.
Free cash flow Free cash flow FCF is calculated as statutory reported net cash flow before financing activities, adjusted to include finance costs paid and exclude net cash from the purchase sale of financial asset investments.
FCF represents the cash that the Group generates after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset base.
In-year trading cash flow In-year trading cash flow reflects the cash generated from the trading activities of the Group.
It is based on reported net cash inflow from operating activities.
It is adjusted to exclude other working capital movements and the cash cost of operating specific items and to include the cash cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset acquisitions and net finance payments.
Other working capital movements include movements in GLS client cash held and in deferred revenue from stamps purchased in prior periods.
In-year trading cash flow is used primarily by Management to show cash being generated by operations less cash investment.
The following table reconciles in-year trading cash flow to the nearest IFRS measure net cash inflow from operating activities.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 | 37 Royal Mail plc | Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs Net cash debt Net cash debt is calculated by netting the value of financial liabilities excluding derivatives against cash and other liquid assets.
It is a measure of the Groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess the combined impact of the Groups indebtedness and its cash position.
The use of the term net cash debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
A reconciliation of net cash debt to reported balance sheet line items is shown below.

Adjusted effective tax rate The adjusted effective tax rate is the adjusted tax charge or credit for the period expressed as a proportion of adjusted profit before tax.
Adjusted effective tax rate is considered to be a useful measure of tax impact for the period.
It approximates the tax rate on the underlying trading business through the exclusion of specific items and the pension charge to cash difference adjustment.

We have also made adjustments for the first year impact of acquisitions and changes in legislation such as the Apprenticeship Levy.
UKPIL will report a 53-week period 310.0 working days in 2018-19.
We will present adjusted results and underlying movements on a 52-week basis.
Our working week consists of 5.5 days.
Therefore, the adjusted UKPIL working days for 2018-19 will be 304.5 days with an estimated revenue and profit decrease of around 15 million.
