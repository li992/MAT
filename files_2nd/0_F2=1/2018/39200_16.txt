Variation of rights Subject to applicable legislation, the rights attached to Ranks ordinary shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of those shares, or by a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the ordinary shareholders.
Directors powers in relation to shares Allotment and issue of shares Subject to the provisions of the CA 2006, and subject to any resolution passed by the Company pursuant to the CA 2006 and other shareholder rights, shares in Rank may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide.

Change of control Our principal term loan and credit facility agreements contain provisions that, on a change of control of Rank, immediate repayment can be demanded of all advances and any accrued interest.
The provisions of the Companys share schemes and incentive plans may cause options and awards granted to employees tovest in the event of a takeover.
A change of control may also affect licences to operate, as specified in the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005, Alderney eGambling Regulations 2009 as amended, the Belgian Games of Chance Act 1999 as amended and the Spanish Gaming Act 2011.
Political donations No political donations were made during the period under review.
It has been Ranks long-standing practice not to make cash payments to political parties and the board intends that this will remain the case.
However, the CA 2006 is very broadly drafted and could catch activities such as funding seminars and other functions to which politicians are invited, supporting certain bodies involved in policy review and law reform and matching employees donations to certain charities.
Accordingly, as in previous years, the directors will be seeking shareholders authority for political donations and political expenditure at the forthcoming annual general meeting in case any of Ranks activities are inadvertently caught by the legislation.
