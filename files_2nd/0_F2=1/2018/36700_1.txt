Hg brings to the Company an experienced team of over 150 employees, including more than 90 investment and other professionals, supported by a network of close to 20 Operating Partners, all of them seasoned senior managers from across industry, who work with management teams to create value for shareholders.
At the centre of this network, Hg builds and shares knowledge and expertise by facilitating the active collaboration of management teams across sectors and geographies.
The structure in which our Manager, Hg, invests the Companys funds pro rata alongside those of its large institutional clients enables wealth managers, smaller institutions and individuals to invest, on similar terms, with some of the worlds most sophisticated institutions in businesses that would otherwise be inaccessible.
This allows the Company to achieve diversification across markets and geographies and gain exposure to businesses at different stages of their development and size, from an enterprise value of 50 million to over 1 billion.
