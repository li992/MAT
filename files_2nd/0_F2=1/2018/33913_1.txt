Avast annual report 2018 01 Introducing Avast Keeping people safe and private online is what we do Faster connections, mobile apps, online services and the growth of connected homes mean the internet is increasingly central to our lives.
However, most consumers are not technology experts and they don't always look after their devices... until something goes wrong.

At Avast, our products are designed to deliver industry-leading consumer security, privacy and performance to more than 435 million users globally.
