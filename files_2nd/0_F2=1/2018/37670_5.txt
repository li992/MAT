Private housing market background There has been a slowdown recently in the general housing market, which is expected to deteriorate further until Brexit uncertainty reduces.
Although mortgage applications and property transactions have fallen, house prices have continued to rise in most regions, as supply has adjusted accordingly.
Latent demand remains strong and the Governments focus continues to be to increase net supply to 300,000 homes per year by the mid-2020s.
Private housing repair, maintenance and improvement expenditure is driven by housing wealth, pension wealth and household savings which are the main sources of finance and continue to be robust in the over-55s age category, which is a key demographic for Marshalls.
