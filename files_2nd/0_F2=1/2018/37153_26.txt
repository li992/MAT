Strong sales growth led by double digit growth in HDD catalysts in every region Light Duty Europe sales were flat but with a stronger second half.
Very strong growth in gasoline offset by a decline in diesel.
Light Duty Americas sales growth ahead of vehicle production driven by a favourable mix.
Light Duty Asia sales growth ahead of vehicle production helped by higher substrate content.
Sales of HDD catalysts were strong across the board and ahead of truck production, helped by a strong Class 8 market, ramp up of business wins in Europe and strong production growth in Asia.
Excluding the US post-retirement medical benefit PRMB plan credit in the prior period, operating profit grew by 9% with margin improving by 0.2 percentage points to 14.2%.

Sales in China increased by more Class 8 trucks.
This than 50%, led by high levels of truck Our Americas HDD catalyst business outperformance was driven by the ramp production as the impact of loading saw very strong growth of 22% led by the up of production from business wins in limits continued to push demand for continued recovery of the Class 8 truck the last financial year and a continued more trucks and an increase in the market.
