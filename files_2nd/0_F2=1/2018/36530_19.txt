2 Jonny Mason resigned from his role as Chief Financial Officer, as announced on 27 March 2018.
Jonnys bonus has been based on the higher salary for the period that he acted as interim Chief Executive Officer.
Benefits Benefits include payments made in relation to life assurance, private health insurance and the provision of a fully expensed company car or equivalent cash allowance or chauffeur and fuel card.
Pension Pension payments represent contributions made either to defined contribution pension schemes or as a cash allowance.
The CEO and CFO both received a contribution of 15% of base salary.
Appointment terms for Graham Stapleton Regular package Graham was appointed as Chief Executive Officer CEO on an annual basic salary of 535,000.
This is considered to be reasonable in light of his retail, digital, services and category credentials.
Graham will receive a pension contribution of 15% of basic salary and standard benefits, in line with our Remuneration Policy the Policy.
Grahams maximum annual bonus opportunity is 150% of salary, in line with Policy, and this was prorated for the period of 2017 18 that he served.
One-third of his annual bonus was deferred into Halfords shares for a period of three years.
In line with our Policy, Graham has a maximum opportunity under the PSP of 200% of salary, and an award at this level was made under the 2017 18 PSP cycle upon appointment.
Buy-out arrangements Graham received a buy-out of 185,872 shares to compensate for awards forfeited when leaving his previous employer, Dixons Carphone plc, which will vest in January 2021, subject to him not having resigned before that date.
This matches the release profile of the forfeited award.
In addition, a contribution will be made towards the Dixons Carphone plc annual bonus he forfeited upon leaving, prorated for the portion of the year he worked there.
This will be paid following the Dixons Carphone plc year end, and will be based upon the actual out-turn as disclosed in their Report and Accounts.
The Committee considers that this treatment is appropriate as it directly matches what he would have received had he remained at this previous employer.
An additional payment will be made to Graham to compensate him for the loss of a cash entitlement of 695,617 under the 2013 Carphone Warehouse scheme.
This payment is subject to clawback provisions, should he resign before July 2021.
Graham will be eligible for reimbursement of certain capped costs of up to 15,000 should he relocate within two years of joining.
Leaving Arrangements for Jonny Mason Jonny Mason resigned from his role as Chief Financial Officer CFO, as announced on 27 March 2018, to take up a position of Group Finance Director at Dixons Carphone plc.

Jonny will receive the cash element of his annual bonus for the year ended 30 March 2018, but all annual bonus deferred share awards will lapse.
Jonnys long-term incentive arrangements in respect of his awards under the PSP and SAYE schemes will also lapse.

com 87 25675 5 June 2018 1:19 PM Proof 10 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OUR GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW Annual Remuneration Report Shareholding Guidelines The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors interests are aligned with those of our shareholders.
Executive Directors are encouraged to acquire and retain shares with a value equal to 200% of their annual base salary.
Executive Directors are expected to retain 75% of any post-tax shares that vest under any share incentive plans until this shareholding guideline is met.

These figures include those of their spouse or civil partner and infant children, or stepchildren, as required by Section 822 of the Companies Act 2006.
There was no change in these beneficial interests between 30 March 2018 and 22 May 2018.
Outside Appointments Halfords recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies.
Such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Halfords.
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to accept non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
During the year, between 1 April 2017 and 29 September 2017, Jill McDonald received fees of 43,500 as a non-executive director of Inter Continental Hotels Group plc.
Loss of Office Payments Audited No loss of office payment was made to a Director during the year.

88 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 30 March 2018 25675 5 June 2018 1:19 PM Proof 10 How the Remuneration Policy will be Implemented for FY19 Executive Directors Salary Current salaries for the Executive Directors are as follows: Chief Executive Officer 535,000 Chief Financial Officer 364,140 Salaries will next be reviewed with effect from 1 October 2018.
Annual Bonus The annual bonus opportunity for 2018 2019 will be as follows: Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Maximum opportunity of 150% of base salary 2 3 paid in cash 1 3 paid in Halfords shares deferred for three years The annual bonus will continue to be based 80% on Profit Before Tax PBT performance and 20% based on performance against strategic objectives.
PBT targets range from 95% of budget, where payment is 15% to 110% of budget for maximum payment.
The Committee reviews the goals included in the strategic objectives portion of the bonus to ensure that they remain appropriate.
These objectives include metrics in relation to customer service, colleague engagement, digital and service sales growth.
In determining whether any bonuses are payable, the Committee retains the discretionary authority to increase or decrease the bonus to ensure that the level of bonus paid is appropriate in the context of performance.
Bonus targets are released retrospectively as they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they could reveal information about Halfords business plan and budgeting process to competitors which could be damaging to Halfords business interests and therefore to shareholders.
Performance Share Plan PSP As outlined in the Remuneration Committee Chair's letter, it is important that the performance targets attached to the FY19 LTIP awards are fully aligned with Halfords' strategy over the next three years.
As we set out elsewhere in the annual report, it is anticipated that our strategic review will be finalised and the outcome communicated to the market in September 2018.
Immediately following this, the Committee will consider and set the performance targets, which is currently expected to be in September 2018.
