STRATEGIC REPORT Transformation in action Transformation of SIG Distribution Despite the challenging market conditions witnessed over the past twelve months, SIG Distribution, the leading distributor of insulation and interior products in the UK, posted a significant year-on-year improvement in profits in 2018 of 21m 2017: 4m.
This major step-up was achieved by introducing radical changes across a number of under-performing areas of the business: the first of which was to address the calibre of the leadership personnel in the business, resulting in significantly enhanced capability and the development of a can do attitude.
In May 2018, SIG Distribution embarked on transforming its pricing processes and structures, along with carrying out a detailed review of its customer base, consciously walking away from low margin and nonprofitable business where considered appropriate.
Whilst this has inevitably contributed toward the year-on-year drop in revenues, there has been a marked improvement in gross margins and profitability, particularly in the second half of the year, bringing significant financial benefits into 2019.
In addition, a restructure of the operating model during the year has turned the historic branch-centric business model into one that is function-led, which has helped to drive a significant amount of overhead out of the business, particularly in the areas of sales and inventory.
SIG Distribution has transformed the processes over its inventory management and the move from branch to central control has allowed the business to maximise efficiency through capable and effective management of its stock levels, resulting in a year-on-year reduction of 15%.
The transformation is well underway in SIG Distribution, and a marked step-up in financial performance indicators in the second half, return on sales and opex as a % of sales, provides comfort that the business has the necessary momentum to deliver further progress into 2019 and beyond.
