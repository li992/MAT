Ascential plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report OUR ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Company aims to maximise shareholder value by optimising potential for return on capital through strategic investment and divestment, by ensuring the Companys capital structure is managed to support both strategic and operational requirements, and by delivering returns through a focus on organic growth and operational discipline.
The Board considers it helpful to provide, where practicable, performance measures that distinguish between these different factors these are also the measures that the Board uses to assess the performance of the Company, on which the strategic planning process is founded and on which management incentives are based.
Accordingly, this report presents the following non-GAAP measures alongside standard accounting terms as prescribed by IFRS and the Companies Act, in order to provide this useful additional information.
Organic growth measures To assess whether the Company is achieving its strategic goal of driving organic growth, it is helpful to compare like-for-like operational results between periods.
Income statement measures, both Adjusted and Reported, can be significantly affected by the following factors which mask like-for-like comparability: acquisitions and disposals of businesses lead to a lack of comparability between periods due to consolidation of only part of a years results for these businesses: changes in exchange rates used to record the results of non-Sterling businesses result in a lack of comparability between periods as equivalent local currency amounts are recorded at different Sterling amounts in different periods: and event timing differences between periods.
The Group has no biennial events, but when annual events are held at different times of year this can affect the comparability of half-year results.
Ascential therefore defines Organic growth measures, which are calculated with the following adjustments: results of acquired and disposed businesses are excluded where the consolidated results include only part-year results in either current or prior periods: prior year consolidated results are restated at current year exchange rates for non-Sterling businesses: and prior year results are adjusted such that comparative results of events that have been held at different times of year if any are included in the same period as the current year results.
