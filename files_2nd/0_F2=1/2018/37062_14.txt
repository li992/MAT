Focus investments are those investments that are not within the 20 most valuable but on which the life sciences and technology teams focus a significant proportion of their resources and capital.
These investments typically, although not exclusively, fall within the 100 most valuable portfolio company holdings by year-end value.
Other companies are those that are not within the Top 20 or focus category.
Companies which are at a very early stage or in which the Groups holding is of minimal value, but remain as operating businesses, are classed as fide minimis holdings.
Organic holdings are investments in which the Group has acquired a shareholding upon creating the company as a result of our technology transfer relationship with Imperial College London, but in which we have not actively invested.
The total value of the Groups 147 portfolio companies excluding multi-sector platforms, organic investments and fide minimis holdings, calculated by reference to the Groups holding in such companies and grossed up to reflect their total value, is now in excess of 5bn, or almost 6bn including the Groups holdings in multi-sector platform companies, most significantly Oxford Sciences Innovation plc 2017: 4bn, 5bn.
Portfolio analysis by sector The Group funds spin-out companies based on a wide variety of scientific research emerging from leading researchintensive institutions and does not limit itself to funding companies from particular areas of science.
The Group splits its core opportunity evaluation, investment and business-building team into two specialist divisions, Life Sciences and Technology.
Where the Group invests in businesses that cannot be classified within these divisions, primarily those portfolio companies which also invest in other opportunities, they are recorded as multi-sector platforms.
An update on the two primary operating segments is included in the financial review on pages 32 to 35.
