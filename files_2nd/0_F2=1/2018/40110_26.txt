VIABILITY STATEMENT The UK Corporate Governance code requires the Board to express its view of the long-term viability of the Group and assess the Companys prospects, capital management and key risks.
Accordingly, the Board has carried out a thorough and robust assessment of the risks, including stress testing its resilience to threats to its business model, future performance, liquidity and the risks identified in the Risk & Uncertainties section of this report, which can be found on pages 87 to 93 together with the steps the Company has taken to mitigate them.
The Board chose to review these over a three-year period as this best reflects the budgeting and planning process of the Company and the expected timescales for strategy implementation.
In relation to each viability related risk the Board has: MARKET FORCES tested the business models resilience to changes in the Retail market and responses to variability in sales and margins TREASURY & FINANCIAL RISK reviewed the Revolving Credit Facility and its suitability for the Groups cash flow cycle and liquidity requirements reviewed the Group hedging strategy BREXIT reviewed the proposal for post-Brexit operations and adaptions to the business model SUPPLY CHAIN reviewed the arrangements with key suppliers The Board has reviewed the Group modelling of the impact of each risk and stress testing of the risk mitigation proposals, with regard to both income and profitability, and net debt impact.
The Group has a 913.5m banking facility in place until November 2021 with a one year extension option with a syndicate of institutions.
The Group has consistently created a strong free cash flow from underlying trading and has an appropriate hedging strategy to meet currency risks.
Based on the Boards assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue operating and be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period assessed, assuming no major changes in its relationship with key suppliers.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 18 July 2018, and signed on its behalf by: Jon Kempster Chief Financial Officer 130
