Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 137 Collateral Collateral held as security and other credit enhancements The Group evaluates each customers creditworthiness on a case by case basis.
The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Group upon extension of credit, is based on managements credit evaluation of the counterparty.
Collateral held can vary, but may include: specific charges over defined assets of the counterparty: a floating charge over all assets and undertakings of an entity, including uncalled capital and called but unpaid capital: specific or interlocking guarantees: and loan agreements which include affirmative and negative covenants and in some instances guarantees of counterparty obligations.
Generally, the Group does not take possession of collateral it holds as security or call on other credit enhancements that would result in recognition of an asset on its balance sheet.
It is the Groups policy to dispose of repossessed properties with the proceeds used to reduce or repay the outstanding balance.
In general, the Group does not occupy repossessed properties for its own business use.
The LTV ratio of Retail mortgage lending, coupled with the relationship of the debt to customers income, is key to the credit quality of these loans.

Residential mortgages Residential property is the Groups main source of collateral and means of mitigating loss in the event of the default credit risk inherent in its residential mortgage portfolios.
All lending activities are supported by an appropriate form of valuation using either professional or indexed subject to policy rules and confidence levels valuations.
Commercial property Commercial property is the Groups main source of collateral on SME lending and means of mitigating loss in the event of default.
Collateral for the majority of commercial loans comprises first legal charges over freehold or long leasehold property including formal Companies House registration where appropriate.
Non-property related collateral In addition to residential and commercial property based security, the Group also takes other forms of collateral when lending.
This can involve obtaining security against the underlying loan through the use of cash collateral and or netting agreements, both of which reduce the original exposure by the amount of collateral held, subject to volatility and maturity adjustments where applicable.
The Group also operates a policy of obtaining security against the underlying loan via the use of guarantees, which can be either limited or unlimited, making the guarantor liable for only a portion or all of the debt.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 141 SME lending Credit quality of loans and advances For SME lending, the Group has an internally developed credit rating system, as defined under the Groups credit risk management policy, which uses data drawn from a number of sources to assess the potential risk in lending to the Groups customers.
This system assigns an indication of the PD for each customer and can be broadly mapped to external agencies rating scales.
Impaired assets consist of SME lending and secured Retail lending where current circumstances indicate that losses of loan principal and or interest may be incurred.

The credit quality of the portfolio of loans and advances that were neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to the Groups standard credit rating system.
The credit rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics, combined with processed market information to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk.
All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Groups ratings policy.

These systems assign risk estimates to all Retail lending and enable active management of customer exposures and portfolios.
SME forbearance Forbearance is considered to exist for SME customers where one or more concessions are granted on a non-commercial basis.
The Group reports SME forbearance at a customer level and at a value which incorporates all facilities and the related impairment allowance, irrespective of whether each individual facility is subject to forbearance.
Authority to grant forbearance measures for SME customers is held by the Groups Strategic Business Services unit and is exercised, where appropriate, on the basis of detailed consideration of the customers financial position and prospects.
Where a customer is part of a larger group, forbearance is exercised and reported across the Group at the individual entity level.
Where modification of the terms and conditions of an exposure meeting the criteria for classification as forbearance results in derecognition of loans and advances from the balance sheet and the recognition of a new exposure, the new exposure shall be treated as forborne.

The table below shows the maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet excluding loans and advances to customers and other financial assets at fair value.
The maximum exposure is shown gross, before the effect of mitigation through use of master netting and collateral agreements.
The table also shows the maximum amount of commitments from its banking operations.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 143 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities The Group does not have any financial assets or financial liabilities that are offset with the net amount presented on the balance sheet.
This is because IAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation states that there should be both an enforceable right to set off and the intention either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Neither of these conditions are met by the Group.
The table below illustrates the amounts for financial instruments that are covered by enforceable netting arrangements i. e. offsetting agreements and any related financial collateral.
The table excludes financial instruments not subject to offset and that are only subject to collateral arrangements e. g. loans and advances.
The net amounts presented in the table are not intended to represent the Groups exposure to credit risk, as the Group will use a wide range of strategies to mitigate credit risk in addition to netting and collateral.

2 Derivative financial instruments comprise both trading and hedging derivative assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instrument contracts are typically subject to ISDA master netting agreements, as well as CSAs, where relevant, around collateral arrangements attached to those ISDA agreements, or derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements if contracts are settled via an exchange or clearing house.
The amounts included in the Financial instruments column refer to amounts that are subject to relevant close out netting arrangements under a relevant ISDA agreement.
