0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:37 am Page 6 06 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 chief executives report Xstratas net profit for 2004 increased by 563% to $1,088.4 million pre-exceptional items.
While much of the result is due to significantly higher commodity prices achieved across all of our commodities, it also reflects the fact that the two successive company-transforming acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003 created the proper base to benefit from the buoyant commodity markets.
Indeed, Xstrata ends 2004 in a stronger competitive position than ever before, with increased 4 diversification and scale across its portfolio and improved market positions within its business.
EBIT earnings before interest and tax grew by $1,070 million to $1,502 million, representing an increase of 248%.
Higher prices contributed $1.6 billion and net real cost savings $44 million, while the weak US dollar and inflationary impacts on our cost base offset this result by some $580 million.

Xstrata Coal and Xstrata Zinc in particular again made excellent progress in cost 8 efficiencies and productivity improvements.
These two businesses have together achieved real cost savings in excess of 9 $200 million since Xstratas listing in London in 2002.
0 1 Xstrata Zincs San Juan fide Nieva smelter in Spain retained its position as the worlds lowest cost zinc smelter, increasing 2 production for the sixth consecutive year and cutting costs in real terms by over $9 million.
Production at Nordenham increased 3 to over 10% above its nameplate capacity at the time of Xstratas acquisition in December 2002 and the Australian zinc-lead 4 operations benefited from initiatives implemented in the first half to improve mining sequence and optimise production, as part 5 of the ongoing programme to transform Xstratas North Queensland operations.
Further operational efficiencies are expected 6 from the development of the Black Star zinc-lead mine, where production is now underway one of Xstratas four major 7 internal growth projects launched in 2004.
