Apart from the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, all other option and incentive arrangements have been discontinued but awards made in previous years will vest over time, in accordance with the rules governing the various plans.
The details are shown in the section entitled Executive Directors remuneration overview on pages 14 to 17.
The Committee has been advised that this remuneration structure is competitive but not excessive when compared with relevant external benchmarks.
Executive Directors service contracts During the year, a comprehensive review of executive directors service contracts has been undertaken.
Following this review all executive directors have agreed service contracts terminable on no more than 12 months notice by either side, agreed to the removal of the ability to trigger termination and liquidated damages following a change of control and to changes resulting in there being no difference in any damages paid whether termination follows a change of control or not.
These changes were made voluntarily by all affected directors and no payments were made by the Company in recompense.
The full details are summarised below.
As part of the review, the liquidated damages provisions in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract, following a breach of contract by the Company, were also considered.
Having taken independent advice and having carefully considered market competitiveness and the latest views of institutional investors, the Committee concluded that, other than for Bill Whiting who is retiring at the end of March 2005 see below any such damages should be paid on a phased basis with provision for payment to cease or reduce by the value of any new package if an executive secures an alternative position.
Consequently, the contracts for Gerry Murphy, Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown now provide that termination payments would be paid on a phased basis at a monthly rate of 15% of annual salary for a maximum of 12 months.
Lower amounts are payable if the director finds a lower paid job during the 12 month period and payments cease immediately when a job providing the same or higher value package is taken.
These arrangements represent the Committees conservative pre-estimate of the value of each of the directors remuneration package, taking into account bonus opportunity and benefits as well as base salary.
To reflect the arrangements entered into on his appointment, Gerry Murphy would, in addition, continue to receive for the same period a monthly FURB pension contribution or Earnings Cap supplement at a reduced rate of 30% of his monthly salary above the Earnings Cap see pensions paragraph on page 14.
Similar changes have been implemented in the contracts for all senior UK executives.
For Bill Whiting, who is retiring at the end of March 2005 at the age of 57, the termination provisions are 12 months notice, reducing by one month each month from 1 April to 31 December 2004, after which his notice period will be three months.
If the Company terminates his contract without notice and without cause, liquidated damages are payable equal to the cash equivalent of the salary, car and medical benefits of the outstanding notice period: declining to a minimum of three months at any time on and from 1 January 2005.
