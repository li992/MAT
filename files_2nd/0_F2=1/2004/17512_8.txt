These increases were partially offset by the success of 6 Xstrata Alloys coke reduction programme which reduced costs by over $11 million.
Further cost benefits are expected from 7 the acquisition in January 2005 of the African Carbon Group, a local char producer.
8 9 Earnings 0 On 4 November Xstrata announced the permanent closure of its Vantech vanadium operation in Mpumalanga, South Africa.
1 The Vantech operation was put into care and maintenance in early 2004 and production was suspended following the 2 depletion of the Kennedy Vale ore deposit in December 2003.
The decision to close Vantech follows a thorough assessment 3 of the operations future prospects including the financial viability of opening a new mining area at the site.
The closure resulted 4 in an impairment charge of almost $7 million.
5 6 The integration of the former MIM Group was completed during 2004 incurring a charge of $8 million.
In 2004, the acquisition 7 of MIM contributed $2,684 million towards Group turnover and $875 million to Group EBIT in 2004 over half of the 8 Group total.
9 40 Net interest and similar items decreased by $37 million from 2003 on a pro forma basis before exceptionals to $92 million due 41 to the reduction of net debt from strong operating Group cash flows during 2004.

33 34 The statutory pre-exceptionals tax charge is $182 million and represents an effective rate of 12.9% against 20% for 2003.
35 The low tax rate in 2004 is mainly due to the utilisation and recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses as a result of 36 substantially increased earnings in 2004.
On a post-exceptionals basis, the tax charge of $177.1 million represents an effective 37 tax rate of 12.9% in 2004.
38 39 The increase in the minority interest share of profits results principally from improved earnings at the 50% owned Alumbrera operation.

1 2 Cash flow, net debt and financing summary 3 Due to the strong operating cash flows being generated at Minera Alumbrera Limited, a return of capital of $162 million was 4 made to shareholders in May 2004 in accordance with the shareholders agreement.
The repayment of the minorities share 5 of $81 million is recorded in the cash flow statement.
6 7 On 28 May 2004, the Group successfully refinanced its existing syndicated loan.
The facility remains at $1.4 billion, however 8 interest margin and commitment fees are substantially lower than those of the previous facility.
The Group expensed capitalised 9 loan arrangement fees associated with the old facility of $35 million in 2004.
0 1 Plant and equipment purchased under finance lease arrangements are excluded from capital expenditure in the cash flow.
2 New finance leases are reported separately in the cash flow summary.
3 4 Statutory cash flow includes the MIM Group from the date of acquisition.
Pro forma cash flow includes the MIM Group from 5 1 January 2003.
Consequently, additional cash inflow, debt acquired and other cash flow items reflect the activities of the 6 MIM Group in the first six months of 2003 and have been adjusted to include the estimated position at 1 January 2003.
7 8 During 2004, strong operational cash flows further strengthened the balance sheet.
Net debt reduced by $767 million during 9 the year including the repayment during the period of the non-recourse project financing in Alumbrera, with a consequent 40 reduction in the net debt to equity ratio to 16.8% at 31 December 2004.

16 17 Under UK GAAP, this Pooling and Sharing Venture is treated as a joint venture where Xstratas interest in the assets and 18 liabilities is included within Investments in the balance sheet and Xstrata Alloys share of earnings is separately disclosed 19 in one line in the profit and loss account.
This Pooling and Sharing Venture will be proportionally consolidated under IFRS.
20 21 The decrease in stocks reflects the transfer of inventories into the PSV and a reduction in European zinc smelter feedstock, 22 partially offset by a rebuilding of adequate coal stocks to avoid supply constraints and higher lead stocks in Europe and copper 23 stocks at Alumbrera due to the timing of shipments over the year end.
24 25 The increase in debtors is primarily due to higher sales prices across all Xstratas commodity businesses, stronger local currencies 26 against the US dollar and lower than normal trade receivables at the end of 2003 due to delayed shipments at Alumbrera and 27 a roof fall at Oaky Creek.
28 29 Creditors have increased principally due to higher tax payable balances as a result of improved earnings across the Group.
30 The balance of the increase includes higher coal royalties payable, and the impact of stronger local currencies against the 31 US dollar.

Overall, capital expenditure across the Group increased by $132 million, or 0 32%, to $550 million.
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by $83 million and expansionary capital expenditure increased 1 by $49 million.
2 3 Sustaining capital expenditure of $306 million included: 4 5 $40 million at Xstrata Coal, relating to fleet replacements at Bulga, the acquisition of continuous miners at South Witbank 6 and Tavistock, mine development at WitCons, a drift conveyor and the first stage of the installation of a new longwall at 7 Ulan: and 8 9 $50 million at Xstrata Copper for mobile equipment replacements to mine at greater depth at both Alumbrera and Ernest 0 Henry, together with mine development at Mount Isa.
1 2 While the expenditure above is generally sustaining in nature, the investment in new modern equipment and technologies will 3 also increase efficiencies and expand throughput.
4 5 Significant expansionary capital in 2004 related to the initiation of Xstratas growth projects.
The development of the Rolleston 6 coal project incurred expenditure of $122 million.
Despite cost increases in a number of key inputs this project remains on track 7 and on budget for production in late 2005.
An initial $15 million was spent in 2004 as construction of phase one of the Project 8 Lion ferrochrome smelter and related mine commenced.
The development of the Black Star zinc-lead open pit at Mount Isa 9 incurred $18 million of capital expenditure.

Xstrata Coal will spend around $55 million in 2005 to complete the installation of the Ulan longwall, which will see the existing 250 metre longwall replaced by a longwall of some 400 metres, the widest in Australia.
This project will not only substantially increase production, but is expected to lead to a significant 4 improvement in unit costs.
In South Africa, the ongoing modernisation and mechanisation programme in the coal operations will involve expenditure during the year of around $20 million.
Following the capital enhancement programme implemented across the Mount Isa copper operations in 2004, increased sustaining expenditure in 2005 will be directed to the zinc operations at Mount Isa to significantly improve productivity and costs.
Around $40 million of additional expenditure will be incurred relating to mine development and mobile equipment at 0 George Fisher, together with the installation of a zinc filter plant at the Mount Isa concentrating facilities.
1 2 In addition to these specific projects, further sustaining capital of approximately $200 million is expected to be incurred across 3 the Group.
4 5 Expansionary capital is also set to rise versus 2004 levels.
In addition to a number of smaller growth projects across the Group, 6 totalling some $200 million, major project-related items of expansionary capital expenditure include: 7 8 $30 million to expand throughput at the Mount Isa copper smelter to 280,000 tonnes per annum, an increase of 40,000 9 tonnes over current capacity.
The project comprises the installation of a second rotary holding furnace to remove a current 0 bottleneck in the flowsheet.
This high-return expansion implies a capital cost of only $750 per tonne of incremental anode 1 capacity, which compares favourably against other brownfield copper smelter expansions: 2 3 $25 million to develop the Northern 3500 underground copper orebody at Mount Isa, which will provide an additional 4 high-grade mining zone in the Enterprise underground copper mine.
The development enables improved utilisation of the 5 existing hoisting and concentrating facilities and allows the mine to achieve its rated capacity of 3.5 million tonnes per annum: 6 7 $30 million Xstratas share to upgrade the coal flotation plants at both Collinsville and Newlands.
Since the acquisition 8 of MIM, detailed planning by Xstrata has determined that by installing a new coal handling and preparation technology, 9 a Dense Medium Cyclone DMC plant, production of substantial quantities of coking coal can be achieved.
Cash payback 0 for both wash plant upgrades is less than one year, with commensurate internal rates of return.
In addition, the Newlands 1 plant provides additional capacity to coincide with the development of the Northern Underground mine, which will replace 2 production from the existing Southern Underground mine.
The Northern Underground mine will be completed in late 2005 3 after remaining expenditure of approximately $25 million Xstratas share : and 4 5 $20 million for the initial phase of the development of the Goedgevonden colliery in South Africa.
Once complete, total 6 annual production from Goedgevonden is anticipated to reach three million tonnes of export thermal coal and two million 7 tonnes of domestic power station feedstock.
8 9 In addition, development of two of Xstratas key growth projects, namely the Rolleston coal project and Project Lion, will continue 40 in 2005, with capital expenditure of approximately $110 million and $190 million respectively anticipated during the year.

18 A further $30 million is payable to a community trust during the development and construction phases of the project.
This 19 amount reduces to $4 million should the project not proceed to development.
The Las Bambas copper project is within the 20 Southern Peru copper belt, which hosts a series of major copper operations including Toquepala and Cuajone SPCC, Tintaya 21 BHP Billiton and Cerro Verde Phelps Dodge.
A comprehensive drilling programme, at a cost of some $10 million in 2005, 22 has recently commenced in March 2005.
