Basis of preparation of the accounts As set out in the statement of directors responsibilities on page 36, the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.

For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Supplier payment policy The Group requires its subsidiaries to negotiate clear and satisfactory arrangements for the payment of suppliers, as part of the overall terms and conditions of the supply, and to make payment accordingly.
At the year end there were 53 days of purchases outstanding for the Groups UK subsidiaries.
