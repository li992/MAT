Caledonia Investments plc 31 Annual report 2004 Directors report The directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 March 2004.
This report should be read in conjunction with the directors remuneration report and the corporate governance report.
Principal activities and results Caledonia is an investment trust company.
A review of the activities of the company and its operating subsidiaries, together with the results for the year, is given in the chairmans statement, the chief executives report, the investment review and the financial review, which should be regarded as part of this report.
With effect from 1 April 2003, the company has been managing its affairs, so as to enable it to comply with the requirements for approval as an authorised investment trust.
Approval as an investment trust is granted retrospectively by the Inland Revenue for each financial year of a company for which such status is sought.
An application for approval for the year ended 31 March 2004 will be made subsequent to the approval of these accounts by members of the company.
Annual general meeting The notice of the annual general meeting to be held on 14 July 2004 set out on page 75 contains three items of special business.
Resolution 2 seeks shareholders approval of the directors remuneration report in compliance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The directors remuneration report, which is set out on pages 34 to 41, explains the companys overall policy on directors remuneration and provides details of the remuneration paid to directors for the year ended 31 March 2004.
Resolution 9 will be proposed, as in previous years, to renew the authority last granted on 18 July 2003 to allot unissued ordinary shares in the capital of the company.
Whilst they do not have any present intention of exercising this authority, the directors would be authorised to allot shares up to a nominal amount of 1,210,224, representing approximately 33.33% of the companys issued ordinary share capital as at 19 May 2004.
The authority, if granted, will last until the next annual general meeting.
Resolution 10 seeks to renew the directors ability to issue ordinary shares for cash in connection with a rights issue or other than pro rata to existing shareholders.
In the case of an issue of ordinary shares other than pro rata to existing shareholders, the authority will be limited to a nominal amount of 181,533, which represents approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 19 May 2004.
Extraordinary general meeting The company is seeking shareholders approval at an extraordinary general meeting convened for 11 June 2004 EGM for an authority to make market purchases of up to 7,260,000 of its own ordinary shares, being approximately 10% of the companys issued ordinary share capital, at a price per ordinary share not more than 5% greater than the average of the middle market quotations for such shares during the five business days preceding any such purchase, nor less than 5 pence, being the nominal value of an ordinary share.
The company has stated that it will not make market purchases of its own shares where to do so would result in the voting rights of the concert party that is deemed to exist by virtue of the Cayzer family interests in the company Concert Party exceeding 49.9%.
At 19 May 2004, being the date of this report, the total voting rights of the Concert Party stood at 48.62%.
The company is also seeking shareholders approval at the EGM of a waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the obligation that could arise on the Concert Party under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers to make a general offer for the company following an increase in the voting rights of the Concert Party as a result of the company making market purchases of its own shares.
If granted, this waiver will enable the company to make market purchases of its shares provided that such purchases do not increase the total voting rights of the Concert Party to over 49.9%.
Without this waiver, the company will only be able to use the power to make market purchases of its own ordinary shares provided that any such purchases do not increase the percentage voting rights of the Concert Party either to above its highest percentage in the previous 12 months or by more than 1% over the previous 12 months, after taking into account any purchases made by the Concert Party during that period.
It will be the directors intention to use this power only in circumstances where they believe, after careful consideration, that such a purchase would be in the best interests of shareholders and would result in an increase in net asset value per ordinary share.
In considering whether to exercise this power, the directors will also take into account both the longer term investment opportunities available to the company and the discount at which its shares are trading in the market relative to their underlying net asset value.
The authority to make market purchases, if granted at the EGM, will expire on 1 January 2006 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting following the annual general meeting to be held on 14 July 2004.
Since 1 December 2003, the company has been able to hold shares acquired by way of market purchases as treasury shares rather than having to cancel them.
However, the company does not currently have the requisite power in its articles of association to reissue any shares held in treasury on a non pre-emptive basis.
In order to be able to take full advantage of the flexibility offered by treasury shares, the company is seeking shareholders approval at the EGM to a minor amendment to its articles of association such that the provisions which enable the board to allot shares on a non pre-emptive basis, subject to shareholder approval, will also apply to the reissue of treasury shares.
If this amendment is approved, the authority granted by resolution 10 to issue shares on a non pre-emptive basis will also apply to the reissue of shares held in treasury.
In accordance with the guidelines issued by the Investment Committees of the Association of British Insurers and National Association of Pension Funds Ltd, the directors confirm their intention that no more than 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital should be allotted for cash or, if the shareholder approval referred to above is granted, reissued from treasury, on a non pre-emptive basis during any rolling three year period.

All of the directors served throughout the year, with the exception of Mr J M May, who was appointed on 1 September 2003.
Sir David Kinloch will retire from the board at the conclusion of the annual general meeting on 14 July 2004.
Mr C M Allen-Jones, The Hon C W Cayzer and Mr T C W Ingram retire by rotation at the annual general meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
From 30 June 2004, Mr J R H Loudon will have served as a director for over nine years.
Accordingly, he will also retire at the annual general meeting in accordance with the recommendations of the revised Combined Code published in July 2003 and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election.
Neither The Hon C W Cayzer, nor Mr T C W Ingram, has a contract of service that cannot be determined within one year.
Neither Mr C M Allen-Jones, nor Mr J R H Loudon, both of whom are non-executive directors, has any entitlement to compensation in the event of their ceasing to be directors.
Following formal individual performance evaluation and a review of the structure, size and composition of the board as a whole, the Nomination Committee confirms that the non-executive directors proposed for re-election each continue to demonstrate strong commitment to their roles and that through their knowledge, skills and experience, as evidenced by their biographies that appear on page 29, they continue to provide an effective contribution to the functioning of the board and its committees.
The Nomination Committee therefore believes that both of the non-executive directors proposed for re-election should be re-elected.
