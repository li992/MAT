Market leaders Lurpak, Anchor and Cravendale are among the top brands in the dairy sector and are experiencing considerable growth.
As category leader in the butter, spreads and margarine sector, Arla supplies two of the top three biggest sellers Lurpak Spreadable and Anchor Spreadable.
We also have a strong brand portfolio in the flavoured milk and cheese sectors.
Spreadable leads the way Arla has continued to deliver in the spreadable sector.
Lurpak Spreadable has grown by 13 per cent and Lurpak Lighter Spreadable by 23 per cent over the past year, taking the total retail value of Lurpak Spreadable to 116 million.
Anchor Spreadable also followed this trend and sales increased by over 17 per cent, supported by a 7 million advertising campaign.
Substantial investment in our market leading brands Cravendale is an outstanding success story, reaching more consumers than ever and enjoys 90 per cent distribution in the key multiple sector.
Customer demand is so high that we are investing 20 million in a phase two development at our new Stourton dairy, to create a real growth opportunity for Cravendale by doubling our processing capacity for this exciting brand.
