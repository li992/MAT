Directors Report The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2004.
Results and Dividends The revenue attributable to equity Shareholders for the year amounted to 13,743,000.
The first, second and third interim dividends of 4.5p per Ordinary share each were paid on 16 January 2004, 5 April 2004 and 16 July 2004.
The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 4.75p per Ordinary share payable on 29 October 2004 to holders of Ordinary shares on the register on 1 October 2004 making a total distribution to Ordinary Shareholders of 12,755,000, as shown in Note 6.
A resolution in respect of the final dividend will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The sum of 988,000 has been added to the Companys revenue reserve.
Dividends are paid by means of three interim dividends and a final, normally in January, April, July and October.
Further details on dividends are contained in the Chairmans Statement on page 10.
The Net Asset Value per Ordinary share at 30 June 2004 was 496.2p 2003 433.8p.
Share Repurchases and Issue of Shares At the Annual General Meeting held on 29 October 2003, Shareholders approved the renewal of the authority permitting the Company to repurchase its Ordinary shares.
The Directors wish to renew the authority given by Shareholders at the previous Annual General Meeting.
The principal aim of a share buy-back facility is to enhance Shareholder value by acquiring shares at a discount to Net Asset Value, as and when the Directors consider this to be appropriate.
The purchase of shares, when they are trading at a discount to Net Asset Value per share, should result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders.
This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so would result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders and if it is in the best interests of Shareholders generally.
Any purchase of shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
It is proposed to seek Shareholder authority to renew this facility for another year at the Annual General Meeting.
Under the Listing Rules, the maximum price that may be paid on the exercise of this authority must not exceed 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the shares over the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase.
The minimum price which may be paid is 25p per share.
Shares which are purchased under this authority will be cancelled.
It is currently proposed that the purchase of shares by the Company will be made from the realised capital reserve of the Company.
The purchase price will normally be paid out of the cash balances held by the Company from time to time.
9 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, will renew the authority to purchase in the market a maximum of 14.99% of Shares in issue on 13 September 2004 amounting to 10,329,227 Ordinary Shares.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means in effect that the authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting or earlier if the authority has been exhausted.
During the year ended 30 June 2004 and from the date of renewal of the authority on 29 October 2003 to 30 June 2004, share repurchases totalling 643,000 Ordinary shares of 25p each 0.9% of the issued Ordinary share capital at 29 October 2003 and 30 June 2003 took place at an average price of 428.56p within the established guidelines.
From the date of renewal of the authority on 29 October 2003 to 13 September 2004, 1,298,000 Ordinary shares of 25p each 1.85% of the issued Ordinary share capital at 29 October 2003 and 30 June 2003 were bought back at an average price of 427.3p within the established guidelines.
Issue of Shares In terms of the Companies Act 1985 the Act the Directors may not allot unissued Shares unless so authorised by the Shareholders.
10 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, if passed, will therefore give the Directors the necessary authority to allot the unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of 861,343 equivalent to 3,445,372 Ordinary Shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued share capital at 13 September 2004, the latest 26 Murray Income Trust PLC practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of the passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means that the authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting.
When shares are to be allotted for cash, section 89 1 of the Companies Act provides that existing Shareholders have pre-emption rights and that the new shares must be offered first to such Shareholders in proportion to their existing holding of shares.
However, Shareholders can, by special resolution, authorise the Directors to allot shares otherwise than by a pro rata issue to existing Shareholders.
11 will, if passed, also give the Directors power to allot for cash, equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 861,343 equivalent to 3,445,372 shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued share capital at 13 September 2004, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report, as if section 89 1 of the Companies Act does not apply.
This is the same nominal amount of share capital which the Directors are seeking the authority to allot pursuant to Resolution No.
This authority will also expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months, whichever is earlier.
This authority will not be used in connection with a rights issue by the Company.
The Directors intend to use the authority given by Resolutions No.
11 to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights only in circumstances where this will be clearly beneficial to Shareholders as a whole.
As such, issues will only be made where shares can be issued at a premium of 2.5 per cent or more to Net Asset Value.
At present, the shares are available under the savings plans operated by the Manager.
In circumstances where the share price of the Company stands at a premium of 2.5 per cent or more to Net Asset Value, it may be advantageous for the Company to allot new shares directly to participants in the savings plans or to other prospective purchasers.
As such issues would only be made at prices greater than Net Asset Value, they would increase the assets underlying each share.
The issue proceeds would be available for investment in line with the Companys investment policy.
No issue of shares will be made which would effectively alter the control of the Company without the prior approval of Shareholders in general meeting.
Share Capital The issued Ordinary share capital at 30 June 2004 and 13 September 2004 amounted to 69,562,458 Ordinary shares and 68,907,458 Ordinary shares respectively.
