0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:37 am Page 36 36 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 operating and financial review | alloys Vanadium | Markets The continued robust growth in carbon steel production, estimated at approximately 8% for 2004, combined with increased demand for high strength and speciality steels, supported an improved vanadium market.
Global vanadium supply rose 9% year on year, principally from higher secondary production.
Producers did not anticipate the strong increase in demand, and 4 struggled to keep pace with market growth for vanadium units.
As a result, the average published price for ferrovanadium in 2004 rose to around $27 per kilogram, a significant increase compared to recent years and the tight supply of vanadium has led to further price increases into 2005.
The short-term outlook for vanadium demand looks healthy due to continued strong carbon steel production, but is unlikely to be sustainable over the longer term, with prices expected to revert towards historical levels.
Despite an improved short-term 0 outlook for demand, supply of vanadium continues to be unpredictable.
Whilst some supply was taken out of the market 1 with the closure of both Vantech and Windimurra during 2004, the vanadium market continues to be characterised by a 2 large number of secondary producers, whose production decisions are largely independent of underlying market demand.

Increased 15 profitability was principally driven by higher sales prices, despite the effects of US dollar weakness and marginal increases in 16 real unit costs during the period.
Vanadium pentoxide volumes were lower than the previous year, due to the suspension of 17 production at Vantech at the end of December 2003 and subsequent permanent closure of the site, as well as the permanent 18 closure of the Windimurra vanadium operation, which had been on care and maintenance since production was suspended 19 in February 2003.
20 21 Despite an unscheduled maintenance shutdown at Rhovan in January 2004 that negatively impacted throughput, record 22 production levels were achieved for the year.
The vanadium trioxide V O plant and furnace was successfully commissioned 23 2 3 during the year and has materially reduced aluminium consumption at Rhovan.
24 Inspecting headlamps at Kroondal 25 chrome mine, South Africa Developments 26 The permanent closure of Xstratas Windimurra operation in Western Australia was announced in May 2004.
The decision 27 Chrome ore on conveyor, Kroondal mine, South Africa to close the plant was taken following a thorough assessment of the operations ongoing financial viability, taking into 28 account the estimated cost and timeframe of returning the plant to operation, the expected cost of production and Xstratas 29 Ferrovanadium at Rhovan assumptions regarding the long-run vanadium price and Australian dollar exchange rate.
Xstrata has recently upgraded its 30 vanadium operation, South Africa environmental rehabilitation and closure team to ensure a timely and fully compliant closure of the Windimurra asset.
This is 31 being done in close consultation with the relevant government departments and key stakeholders in Western Australia.
Leases 32 on the Windimurra resource will be relinquished to the Western Australian Government as soon as this process is complete, 33 or earlier if the Government wishes.
34 35 In November 2004, Xstrata announced the permanent closure of its Vantech vanadium operation in South Africa, which 36 had been put onto care and maintenance in early 2004, following depletion of the Kennedy Vale deposit in December 2003.
37 The decision to close the plant was taken following a thorough assessment of the financial viability of opening a new mining 38 area to exploit the Steelpoortdrift deposit.
Rehabilitation of the site is currently underway.

Sustained tightness in availability from major producing nations saw 2004 characterised by higher price levels.
The term 4 contract price for Australian thermal coal, previously referred to as the Japanese Reference Price, was unclear this year with producers 5 settling term tonnage into Japan at varying price levels depending on the timing of the contract.
For its annual contracts with 6 most of the Japanese utilities, Xstrata Coal secured a price of $45 per tonne FOB, effective 1 April 2004.
This price represents 7 a 68% price increase on last years unofficial reference price of $26.75 per tonne and surpassed the prices achieved by other 8 Australian shippers who contracted earlier in the year.
Annual supply to the Korean generating companies was priced later 9 at around $51 per tonne, an increase of over 100%, reflecting the markets upward momentum as the year progressed.
10 11 The spot market experienced an unprecedented rise in prices in the early part of the year.
From $39 per tonne in January, 12 Newcastle FOB spot price jumped to approximately $63 per tonne in early July before slipping back to the mid-$50 range 13 for most of the second half of 2004.
14 15 Non-delivery of contracted Chinese export tonnage and delays caused by Indonesian monsoon rains resulted in tight supply 16 from the outset of the year and caused major utilities in Japan, Korea and Taiwan to enter 2004 with low stocks.
The strength 17 in demand was sustained as the year unfolded with a 7% increase across these big three importing nations, despite the 18 gradual return of suspended nuclear output in Japan.
Contributors to demand for coal included growth in industrial production 19 and GDP across the Asia-Pacific region, new coal-burning units coming on-stream in Korea and Taiwan, and a very hot summer 20 in Japan.
In addition, the high price of oil during 2004 prompted power utilities across Asia to switch to coal wherever feasible.
21 22 The supply of thermal coal in the Asia-Pacific region is dominated by Australia, China and Indonesia.
Well-publicised supply 23 constraints in Australia relating to infrastructure, together with self-imposed export quotas in China, allowed Indonesia to 24 continue its strong export growth and claim most of the expansion of the 2004 marketplace.
It is, however, estimated that half 25 of Indonesias growth during the year came from lower-grade sub-bituminous coal which has a limited export market.
Currently, 26 on a total tonnage basis, Australia and Indonesia are now jointly the largest thermal coal exporters in the world, with each 27 exporting around 106 million tonnes per annum.
28 29 New South Wales thermal coal exports increased by approximately 9% period-on-period as a result of increases in throughput 30 at the Newcastle port.
In February 2004, Port Waratah Coal Services PWCS, which manages the port at Newcastle, sought 31 approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ACCC to introduce a capacity distribution system in 32 response to a vessel queuing crisis.
This system quickly reduced the vessel queue from over 50 in March to fewer than ten by 33 July.
Consequently, average demurrage exposure has reduced from over $1.80 per tonne to less than $0.40 per tonne, despite 34 peaks in vessel queuing still occurring at the end of each quarterly allocation period.
PWCS has since received approval to 35 extend the capacity distribution system into 2005.
36 37 Unlike New South Wales, Queenslands thermal coal exports fell by 5% in 2004 after a slow start to the year due to heavy rains 38 and a reclaimer failure at the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal DBCT.
Later in the year DBCT became capacity constrained which 39 saw a queue of 40 ships form by the end of 2004.
In addition, the high prices of metallurgical coals meant that, where possible, 40 mines elected to produce metallurgical coal at the expense of lower-priced thermal.

1 Despite the Chinese governments recent attempts to slow the rate of economic growth, Chinas booming economy has fuelled 2 a rate of growth in domestic demand for coal that is outstripping increases in domestic production.
Consequently, Chinese 3 exports fell in 2004.
The unpredictability of Chinese coal exports was reduced in part by the tightening of the export licence 4 system by the Chinese government.
As signalled early in the year, licences for a total 80 million tonnes of coal were issued 5 during 2004, of which 80% were used for export of thermal coal.
6 7 The major Asian utilities appear to have modified their purchasing policies in response to tight market conditions and the 8 reduction in Chinese exports, placing less reliance on the spot market and returning to term contracts.
Xstrata Coal is directing 9 an increasing percentage of its thermal coal sales into the Asian market as Japanese and Korean customers seek to increase 10 their purchases from reliable Australian term suppliers to protect against Chinese volatility.
Asia continues to consume the bulk 11 of Xstrata Coal Australias export thermal coal and represents about 90% of 2004 export sales, with the remainder going to 12 Europe and the Americas, including a significant supply contract into Mexico priced at $70 per tonne FOB.
Term annual 13 contracts made up 63% of Xstrata Coal Australias export sales with the balance being sold on the spot market.
14 15 Xstrata Coal continues to maintain a stable and balanced domestic portfolio to provide geographic and currency diversification.
16 Domestic thermal coal sales are predominantly long-term contracts with power utilities in both New South Wales and Queensland 17 and represent about 15% of total thermal coal sales from Xstrata Coals Australian operations.
18 19 European and South African thermal coal markets 20 Robust thermal coal markets at the beginning of 2004 continued to gain momentum during the first half of the year with 21 the average price up 57% to $39 per tonne, a substantial improvement year-on-year.
Reduced exports out of South Africa 22 and China, and the flow-on effects of a tight Pacific market arising from infrastructure constraints in New South Wales, all 23 made a positive contribution to the supply and demand balance in the Atlantic.
24 Margaret Skhosana, community 25 member enrolled at Xstrata Coals On the demand side, the Americas, in particular the United States, absorbed a significant share of the growth in Colombian 26 Adult Basic Education Centre export volumes, while Argentina and Chile both purchased additional coal to replace natural gas shortages.
In Europe, import 27 demand rose with the UK and France increasing import tonnage as domestic coal production continues to be phased out.
The Bulga Complex in NSW 28 produced 8.9 million tonnes By April 2004, these developments combined to result in a spot price of approximately $45 per tonne.
By the end of June, 29 of product coal in 2004 with electricity markets showing some improvement and renewed activity in the derivative markets, spot prices surged to 30 above $65 per tonne, albeit for limited physical volumes and a short period of time.
Johannes Khumalo operating the 31 shuttle car at Arthur Taylor Colliery 32 Coming off these mid-year highs, demand was static during the second half of the year.
The advent of CO trading and 33 2 National Allocation Plan NAP limits from 1 January 2005 in the European Union generated uncertainty in forecasting coal 34 burn by power stations, which affected coal purchasing.
On the pricing front, continued use of the derivatives markets to 35 lock in generating margins contributed to price volatility as both liquidity and market drivers, such as electricity and gas 36 prices, changed.
Lower than expected reductions in Polish exports and higher than anticipated Russian export volumes both 37 dampened the market.
Spot prices decreased from approximately $59 per tonne by the end of September, to approximately 38 $51 per tonne in the final quarter of 2004.
39 40 41 41 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:38 am Page 42 operating and financial review | coal The South African domestic market remained strong in 2004, with tightness in supply of higher-grade product and increased demand from Eskom for low-grade coal.
New spot and annual contracts for the supply of low quality coal to Eskom saw overall Eskom sales increase 53% year-on-year.
4 This was achieved despite lower long-term Eskom contract sales volumes from the Douglas Tavistock Joint Venture DTJV due to production difficulties at Middelburg mine.
Xstrata Coals received average Eskom pricing fell year-on-year due to lower inflation-related adjustments, together with a change in contractual quality mix year-on-year.
Despite stable demand in the non-Eskom domestic market, sales volumes decreased by 21% due to the diversion of some higher grade domestic product to the higher margin export market.
The majority of non-Eskom domestic contracts from 0 Xstrata Coal achieved above-inflation increases helped by a change in year-on-year reporting and the quality mix.
1 2 Coking coal markets 3 Demand for export coking coal was driven to record levels by the end of 2004 on the back of two consecutive years of 8% 4 growth in global steel output.
Steel production is expected to grow by an additional 9% in 2005, spurred by increasing 5 Chinese domestic demand for both imported and locally-produced steel.
6 7 For the 2004 05 contract period, Xstrata Coal settled its hard coking coal contracts into the Asian and European markets at 8 varying prices up to $135 per tonne.
Allowing for the large volume of carry-over tonnage associated with production difficulties 9 under MIM, which was delivered at 2003 04 prices, the average price of coal delivered in the new period was approximately 0 $85 per tonne, an increase of 83% on the prior corresponding period.
Similar prices were achieved for Collinsville semi-hard 1 coking coal into the Asian steel market.
2 3 Chinas escalating infrastructure expansion fuelled an increase in its steel imports from Japan, Korea and Taiwan, resulting in 4 a commensurate increase in demand for coking coal from these countries.
Indian demand for imported coking coal was strong 5 as Indian steelmakers supply both China and their own growing domestic steel market.
Growth in the Japanese economy and 6 Mark Parkes, maintenance team member at NSW in the European and North American steel market also contributed to tightness in supply and record steel prices.
7 Ravensworth operations 8 The export coking coal market enjoyed the full impact of this heightened demand as China continued to import hard coking 9 In NSW Mount Owen mine has used best practice rehabilitation coal on long-term contracts and in increasing quantities, while simultaneously restricting its coke and coking coal exports to 0 techniques to transform mined protect domestic steelmakers.
The lack of export coke available from China prompted an increase in global demand for 1 areas into woodland communities imported coking coal, most noticeably in India where imports increased by 15% in 2004.
2 In 2004 Development Consent 3 was secured to increase the life The fundamental market deficit was exacerbated by Australian and Canadian supply issues during 2004, rendering these 4 of Mount Owen operation producers unable to satisfy the additional demand for coking coal in full.
The supply gap was partially met by the USAs 5 by 10 years re-emergence as a high-cost swing supplier to the Asian steelmakers.
6 7 The growth in global demand for hard coking coal has had a positive effect on semi-soft coking coal demand and prices, with 8 semi-soft coking coal used to overcome the shortfall in available hard coking coal.
The semi-soft coking coal price has also been 9 boosted by the buoyant global thermal coal market, which traditionally sets the floor price for this coal.

Xstrata Coals semi-soft coking coal production 2 comes from its New South Wales operations, with almost all such sales going to the Asian markets.

4 Operations Australian thermal coal Total consolidated production for 2004 was 35.6 million tonnes, 3% lower than the prior period.
This decrease is attributable to the sell-down of Xstratas interest in Queensland coal assets from 75% to 55% in November 2003.
On a like-for-like basis, production increased by 3% year-on-year.
0 Despite the impact of the sell-down of Queensland thermal coal operations on production and sales volumes for the period, 1 EBIT increased considerably from the prior year, up 400% from $91 million to $454 million.
This substantial increase was 2 primarily driven by the significantly higher coal prices achieved in 2004, partially offset by a stronger Australian dollar.
3 4 New South Wales production was maintained at 2003 levels.
Despite the closure of Cumnock underground mine and 5 the decision to produce higher margin export coal from Ravensworth East, which has a lower yield than domestic coal, 6 productivity-driven increases were achieved across a number of operations, in particular at Beltana and United.
7 8 On a like-for-like basis, Queensland production rose by 18% in 2004, on the back of increased mining and production at 9 Collinsville and the start up of the Suttor Creek and Eastern Creek operations.
The increase was partially offset by reduced 0 production at Newlands Mains Deposit as this mine reaches the end of its useful life.
1 2 Efficiency and productivity improvements at Beltana, United, Mount Owen and Bulga Open Cut, together with reduced 3 development costs at Newlands Southern underground mine, delivered mine-site unit cost savings.
This positive result was 4 mitigated by higher government royalty costs associated with higher coal prices and increased demurrage expenses, which 5 increased local unit costs by 3%.
After allowing for revenue-related costs and inflation, there was a 4% decrease in unit costs.
6 The continued strengthening of the Australian dollar has seen US dollar unit cash costs increase by 17% from the prior year.
7 8 Despite total production being 3% down on 2003, export sales of thermal coal increased by 6% during the period.

Adjusting 17 for the impact of the sell-down, however, Queensland sales volume actually increased by 11% for the period as the Suttor 18 Creek and Eastern Creek operations were ramped up.
19 20 Notable productivity improvements were made across the New South Wales mines during 2004.
The performance of the 21 Bulga Complex in 2004 set new records, with the coal preparation plant handling 13.5 million tonnes of managed ROM coal, 22 25% up on its previous best of 10.8 million tonnes in 2000.
The Complex also produced, on a managed basis, an impressive 23 8.9 million tonnes of product coal, 27% higher than its previous record of just over seven million tonnes in 2000.
24 Vusi Maseko, employee, and his 25 family, residents at Xstrata Coals Beltanas first full year of operation saw it achieve an annual production of almost six million ROM tonnes managed basis, 26 Witbank Presidential Housing making it the highest and most cost-efficient producing longwall mine in Australia, closely followed by Newlands Southern 27 Initiative, South Africa underground mine.
28 Karen Northey, employee 29 at Bulga Coal Mine, NSW In December 2004 development approval was secured to increase the life of the Mount Owen operation by 10 years, 30 giving access to all mineable reserves.
This approval encompassed the upgrade of mine infrastructure, including rail, to Mike Calitz and Willem Gomell, 31 employees at South Witbank increase capacity from nine million to 15 million tonnes per annum.
This secures the future of both Ravensworth East and 32 Colliery, South Africa Glendell, with Mount Owen now permitted to process export coal from these operations.
The Ravensworth East mine was 33 successfully reengineered as an export mine and was integrated into the Mount Owen Complex.
United, which made the 34 transition from bord and pillar mining to a longwall operation during 2003, also achieved record ROM tonnage during 2004, 35 continuing to perform at consistently high levels of productivity with increased output of almost 500,000 tonnes using a 36 similar size workforce.
37 38 Ulan Open Cut and Baal Bone set new performance benchmarks.
Baal Bone, in particular, took advantage of the buoyant 39 market and the availability of export capacity at Port Kembla to increase its production and productivity levels by 16% with 40 no increase in the workforce.
41 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:38 am Page 46 operating and financial review | coal In Queensland, Newlands production of 10 million tonnes of ROM coal on a managed basis represented a 22% increase from 2003 production.
The Southern Undergrounds achievement of an individual mine record, together with additional output from the open cut operation, resulted in a record number of tonnes processed by the coal preparation plant.
The inclusion of Suttor Creek in NCAs production profile also contributed towards the overall strong performance of the Newlands operation.
4 Suttor Creek contributed approximately eight months of operation and is expected to make a significant contribution to Newlands thermal production profile as it continues to ramp up to Suttor Creek to full production of 3.6 million ROM tonnes per annum on a managed basis in 2006.
Following Xstratas increased shareholding in Cook Colliery to 95% in April 2004, management focused on the consolidation and redesign of the operation.
Parallel to this was a keen emphasis on improved safety management, with these efforts 0 recognised by the Queensland government with the nomination of Cook for the Most Improved Safety Management in 1 Queensland Central West Region Award.
2 3 Australian coking coal 4 Coking coal EBIT, boosted by the higher coal prices achieved in 2004, was up over three-fold year-on-year to $112 million.
5 The operational performance of the former MIM coal operations in Queensland has significantly improved following the 6 successful implementation of a comprehensive turnaround programme.
Xstrata Coals focus on the proactive management 7 of major hazards has secured a dual benefit in the form of improved business productivity and a safer workplace.
8 9 The 17% decrease in production, period-on-period, from 6.3 million tonnes to 5.2 million tonnes was attributable to the 0 sell-down of Queensland coal assets.
Stripping out the effect of the sell-down, production increased by 13%.
1 2 Higher production levels were achieved at Oaky No.
1 as the methane gas drainage programme took effect as well as the 3 significant increase in production at Oaky North enabled by reconfiguration of the longwall equipment.
Since the acquisition 4 of the MIM coal assets, Xstrata Coal has secured a 37% improvement in the productivity of the Oaky Creek longwalls.
The 5 increased production from the Oaky Creek underground operations was partially offset by a planned reduction in production 6 from the higher-cost open cut operation.
7 Newlands coal mine in Queensland produced 10 million tonnes of 8 ROM coal in 2004 During 2004, rail and port infrastructure comprising the central Queensland coal chain generally operated at maximum capacity 9 with the three major routes through Gladstone, Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal DBCT and Abbot Point unable to satisfy requests 0 Coming off-shift at South Witbank Colliery for increased capacity for the 2004 05 contract period.
Although this problem was exacerbated in 2004 by the collapse of 1 DBCTs reclaimer, it is evident that rail infrastructure and supply of rolling stock are also limiting volumes of contracted tonnage 2 Ulan coal mines Bobadeen through DBCT.
The Queensland ports have all sought to implement improvement initiatives to optimise the efficiency of the 3 Irrigation Scheme in NSW is an innovative and sustainable existing infrastructure in the short term but in the longer term major infrastructure expansions will be necessary to meet 4 environmental initiative speculative demand forecasts.
5 6 Local currency unit cash costs rose by 7% period-on-period due to higher royalty payments associated with stronger coal 7 prices.
The removal of the impact of these royalties and inflation shows a marginal decrease in costs period-on-period.
This is 8 a result of cost savings on a mine FOR basis with Oaky North achieving higher production output offset by increased distribution 9 and demurrage expenses.
US dollar unit cash costs have increased by 22% year-on-year due to the strengthening of the 40 Australian dollar.
Removing 16 the effect of the sell-down, export sales volumes rose 7% due to increased production at Oaky No.
1 and Oaky North, despite 17 the coal supply chain issues at DBCT.
18 19 South African thermal coal 20 Total production for 2004 was 19.2 million tonnes, a 14% increase on the prior year.
Contributors to this rise included 21 increased output following the revision of the operating roster at two of the mines, the expansion of operations at Tselentis, 22 and the production and sale of low grade by-product at Phoenix to take advantage of the tightening Eskom market.
23 24 In spite of the constant strength of the South African rand throughout 2004, South African EBIT increased by 370% to 25 $102 million, predominantly due to the high coal prices achieved during the period.
26 27 Local currency unit costs decreased marginally period-on-period and, after removing inflation, real cost savings of approximately 28 5% were achieved on the back of higher levels of production.
However, the continued strengthening of the South African rand 29 meant unit costs in US dollar terms increased by 11%.
30 31 Export sales of thermal coal fell by 7% on the prior period to 12.9 million tonnes.
This decrease however, which was primarily 32 the result of rail capacity constraints, was partially offset by a 9% increase in domestic sales, mainly from the Phoenix operation.
33 34 Operational highlights for the year include: 35 36 the completion of the underground rejuvenation project at Boschmans which saw the move from cut, drill and blast 37 operations to continuous miners as well as the commissioning of higher capacity conveying systems: 38 an increase of 40% in output and record production at Tavistock Colliery following the $10 million investment upgrade 39 of the beneficiation plant and mining equipment in 2003 4 and a revised operating roster.
The plant upgrade has delivered 40 a strong return on capital with a positive outlook for Tavistock in 2005: 41 47
