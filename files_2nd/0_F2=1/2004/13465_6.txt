While in the judgement of the Competent Person there are realistic details of other mineralisation that has a reasonable prospect of being expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become economically extracted in the future but which is not yet classified as Proven Proven or Probable Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur as the or Probable Reserves.
