These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to net earnings and shareholders funds that would be required under Australian GAAP is set out above.
Goodwill For 1997 and prior years, UK GAAP permitted the write off of purchased goodwill on acquisitions directly against reserves.
Under Australian GAAP, goodwill is capitalised and amortised by charges against income over the period during which it is expected to be of benefit, subject to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves in the UK GAAP accounts has been reinstated and amortised for the purpose of the reconciliation statements.
For acquisitions in 1998 and subsequent years, goodwill is capitalised under UK GAAP, in accordance with FRS 10.
Adjustments are required for Australian GAAP purposes where such capitalised goodwill is amortised over periods exceeding 20 years in the UK GAAP accounts.
Profit on sale of operations Under UK GAAP, goodwill previously written off to reserves is reinstated for the purpose of calculating profit on the sale of an operation.
Under Australian GAAP, the equivalent goodwill is capitalised and is subject to amortisation.
The adjustment to the profit on sale of operations under Australian GAAP reflects the lower book value of goodwill for operations sold under Australian GAAP compared with UK GAAP, which results from the above amortisation.
Contributions to fixed asset additions Under UK GAAP, contributions made by governments to the cost of acquiring fixed assets are deferred on the balance sheet and credited to the profit and loss account over the expected useful economic life of the fixed assets to which they relate.
Under Australian GAAP, such contributions are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Taxation Under UK GAAP, provision for taxes arising on remittances of earnings can be made only if the dividends have been accrued or if there is a binding agreement for the distribution of the earnings.
Under Australian GAAP, provision must be made for tax arising on expected future remittances of past earnings.
Under UK GAAP, tax benefits associated with goodwill charged directly to reserves, in 1997 and previous years, must be accumulated in the deferred tax provision.
This means that the tax benefits are not included in earnings until the related goodwill is charged through the profit and loss account, on disposal or closure.
For Australian GAAP, no provision is required for such deferred tax because the goodwill that gave rise to these tax benefits was capitalised and gives rise to amortisation charges against profit.
Dividends Under UK GAAP, ordinary dividends are recognised in the financial year in respect of which they are paid.
Under Australian GAAP, such dividends are not recognised until they are declared, determined or publicly recommended by the Board of directors.
Prior to 1 January 2003, Australian GAAP was consistent with UK GAAP.
Exceptional items Earnings under UK GAAP, stated above, include exceptional net gains of US$592 million 2003: US$126 million relating to profits on disposal of interests in operations less asset write downs and a provision for a contract obligation.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
In other cases, fair values have been calculated using quotations from independent financial institutions, or by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing market rates.
The fair values of cash, short term borrowings and loans to joint ventures and associates approximate to their carrying values, as a result of their short maturity or because they carry floating rates of interest.
If Rio Tintos financial instruments were realised at the fair values shown, tax of US$84 million would become payable 2003: US$86 million payable.
The maturity of the financial instruments is shown in the notes above.

Contingent liabilities The aggregate amount of indemnities and other performance guarantees on which no material loss is expected is US$435 million 2003: US$266 million.
In 2002, the Australian Tax Office issued assessments of approximately A$500 million which amount includes penalties and interest in relation to certain transactions undertaken in 1997 to acquire franking credits.
The transactions were conducted based on the Groups considered view of the law prevailing at the time.
Subsequently, the law was changed.
The Group lodged objections to the assessments and on 26 May 2003 the Australian Tax Office ATO substantially disallowed those objections.
The Group subsequently lodged proceedings in the Federal Court to dispute the assessments.
As required by Australian tax law and practice, part payment of the disputed tax assessments was required pending resolution of the dispute.
A payment of A$164 million US$128 million at the year end exchange rate was made, which will be subject to recovery with interest if, as it is believed based on Counsels opinion, the Group is successful in challenging the assessments.
Consequently, the amount paid has been recorded as a receivable on the balance sheet.
As at the year end, the amount of the disputed tax assessments, penalties and interest stood at approximately A$479 million US$373 million at the year end exchange rate after tax relief on the general interest charge component.
There are a number of legal claims arising from the normal course of business which are currently outstanding against the Group.
No material loss to the Group is expected to result from these claims.
Employee numbers for joint arrangements, joint ventures and associates are proportional to the Groups equity interest.
b Part time employees are included on a full time equivalent basis.
Temporary employees are included in employee numbers.
c People employed by contractors are not included.

Access to the mine site has not been possible and an accurate assessment of the condition of the assets cannot be determined.
Considerable funding would be required to recommence operations to the level which applied at the time of the mines closure in 1989 and these funding requirements cannot be forecast accurately.
The directors do not have access to reliable, verifiable or objective information on BCL and the directors have therefore decided to exclude BCL information from the financial statements.
BCL reported a net profit of US$2 million for the financial year 2003: profit of US$4 million.
This is based upon actual transactions for the financial year.
The aggregate amount of capital and reserves reported by BCL as at 31 December 2004 was US$106 million 2003: US$97 million.
The Group owns 214,887,966 shares in BCL, representing 53.6 per cent of the issued share capital.

Other information A triennial actuarial valuation of the Groups UK plan was made at 31 March 2003 using the projected unit method.
In Australia, whilst Group companies sponsor or subscribe to a number of pension plans, the Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund is the only significant plan.
This plan principally contains defined contribution liabilities but also has defined benefit liabilities.
Valuations are made at least every three years using the projected unit method, with the latest valuation being as at 30 June 2004.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US entities, typically with separate provision for salaried and hourly paid staff.
Valuations are made annually at 1 January using the projected unit method.
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by entities in Canada.
Valuations are updated annually using the projected unit method.
Other defined benefit plans sponsored by the Group around the world were assessed at various dates during 2002, 2003 and 2004.
The above summary is based on the most recent valuation in each case, updated to the appropriate balance sheet date.
The expected average remaining service life in the plans relating to the Groups major entities ranges from eight to 17 years, with an overall average of 12 years.
The main pension plans, providing purely defined contribution benefits, held assets equal to their liabilities, of US$180 million as at 31 December 2004 US$186 million at 31 December 2003.
The Groups contributions to these plans of US$6 million 2003: US$9 million are charged against profits and are included in the Regular cost shown below.
The Group also operates a number of unfunded plans, which are included within the deficit and percentage coverage statistics above, measured on a basis consistent with both SSAP 24 and FRS 17.

On 30 September 2004, the unfunded accumulated post retirement benefit obligation and annual cost of accrual of benefits were determined by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The main financial assumptions were: discount rate 5.7 per cent at 30 September 2003: 6.1 per cent, Medical Trend Rate 10.5 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by the year 2011 at 30 September 2003: initially 11.2 per cent reducing to 4.7 per cent by the year 2011, claims cost based on individual company experience.
The assumptions were consistent with those adopted for determining pension costs.
At 30 September 2004, which is the measurement date, the unfunded accumulated post retirement benefits obligation excluding associates and joint ventures was US$523 million at 30 September 2003: US$563 million.

The standard requires pension deficits, and surpluses to the extent that they are considered recoverable, to be recognised in full.
Annual service cost and net financial income on the assets and liabilities of the plans are recognised through earnings.
Other fluctuations in the value of the surpluses deficits are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL.
Details of post retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004, 2003 and 2002, valued on a projected unit basis in accordance with FRS 17, are set out below: UK Australia US Canada Other mainly Main assumptions for FRS 17 purposes Africa At 31 December 2004 Rate of increase in salaries 4.9% 4.7% 4.2% 4.4% 6.0% Rate of increase in pensions 2.9% 2.7% 4.0% Discount rate 5.3% 5.1% 5.6% 5.6% 8.5% Inflation 2.9% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% 4.0% At 31 December 2003 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 6.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.8% 2.5% 4.5% Discount rate 5.4% 6.0% 5.9% 6.1% 9.0% Inflation 2.8% 2.5% 2.5% 2.3% 4.5% At 31 December 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 4.0% 3.2% 3.7% 10.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.3% 2.5% 7.0% Discount rate 5.6% 6.2% 6.2% 6.5% 11.5% Inflation 2.3% 2.5% 2.2% 2.2% 7.0% The main financial assumptions used for the healthcare schemes, which are predominantly in the US, were: discount rate: 5.6% 2003: 5.9%, 2002: 6.2%, Medical Trend Rate: 10.7% reducing to 5.2% by the year 2011 2003: Medical Trend Rate: 11.5% reducing to 5.0% by the year 2011, 2002: Medical Trend Rate 8.0% reducing to 5.0% by the year 2009, claims cost based on individual company experience.
For the pension and healthcare arrangements the post retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The mortality table used for the main arrangements implies that a 60 year old male has an expected future lifetime of 24 years.
In addition, there were contributions of US$26 million 2003: US$18 million in respect of unfunded healthcare schemes in the year.
Since these schemes are unfunded, contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments and therefore cannot be pre-determined.
In relation to pensions, it is currently expected that there will be no significant regular employer or employee contributions to the UK plan in 2005.
Contributions are made to the main Australian plan according to the recommendation of the plan actuary and are primarily to a mixed defined benefit defined contribution type arrangement included in the above figures.
In North America, contributions are agreed annually in nominal terms.
Whilst contributions for 2005 are yet to be determined, the currently expected level of contributions by the Group to the plans in Australia, Canada and the US is expected to be similar in aggregate to that made in 2004.
The most recent full valuation of the UK plans was at 31 March 2003.
The most recent full valuation of the Australian plans was at 30 June 2004.
For both the US and Canadian major plans, the most recent full valuation was at 1 January 2004.
