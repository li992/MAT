Further details are set out in Shareholder Information on page 80.
The trustee of the Cattles Employee benefit Trust has agreed to waive the right to receive dividends over and above 0.01p per share on all shares it holds for the purpose of the Restricted Share Scheme.
It waived dividends of 180,000 2003: 170,000 on these shares during the year ended 31 December 2004.
Directors The Board comprises the non-executive Chairman, four executive directors and three independent non-executive directors, details of whom, together with brief biographical information, are set out on pages 18 and 19.
The companys Articles of Association require Mr F Dee, who was appointed as a director of the company on 30 June 2004 by the directors, to be re-appointed at the annual general meeting on 5 May 2005.
Mr Dee does not have a service contract.
The companys Articles of Association also require that one third, or as nearly as possible but not less than one third, of the directors retire by rotation each year.
Accordingly, the directors retiring by rotation and, being eligible, offering themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting on 5 May 2005 are Mr D A Haxby, non-executive director, who does not have a service contract and Mr S P Mahon and Mr I S Cummine, both of whom hold ofce as executive directors and have rolling service contracts requiring a period of 12 months notice from the company or six months from the director.
Mr B Cottingham, non-executive Chairman, will have served as a director for 10 years on 11 May 2005.
7.2 of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which requires a non-executive director, who has served for more than nine years to be subject to annual re-election, does not apply to the Chairman who satisfied the test of independence on his appointment.
Notwithstanding this, Mr Cottingham and the Board have concluded that it would be good Corporate Governance practice in these circumstances for the Chairman to retire and offer himself for re-election each year.
The Board has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders the re-election of Mr Cottingham as a director as they greatly value his wide business experience and his continuing contribution to the leadership and effectiveness of the Board.
All directors are re-elected at intervals of not more than three years, in accordance with the provisions of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Details of the directors remuneration, share incentives and options, and pension arrangements are set out in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration on pages 31 to 41.
No director has had a contract of signicance, other than a service contract, with the company or any subsidiary undertaking during the year.

Statement of Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group for that year.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been consistently applied, except as set out in note 1 l on page 48.
The directors also confirm that reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004, that applicable accounting standards have been followed and that the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
These financial statements will be published on the companys website, in addition to the paper version posted to shareholders.
The maintenance and integrity of the Cattles plc website is the responsibility of the directors.
The work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Funding and Financial Hedging Instruments In July 2004, the group successfully completed a new five year syndicated bank facility for 500 million.
An additional six year 50 million bilateral facility was agreed in August 2004.
The new funding replaced maturing facilities of 353 million and provides the group with improved headroom to support future development and growth.
After repaying the maturing facilities, the groups total available funding facilities have increased by 197 million to 1,577 million.
Details of the groups funding prole are set out in note 18 i on page 61 and note 19 on pages 61 and 62.
It is company policy to manage the risk of exposure to adverse interest rate and foreign currency uctuations by the use of financial hedging instruments such as swaps.
It is not the policy of the company to trade in such instruments.
The level of protection contracted for at any particular time would not exceed the companys exposure to actual or projected borrowings, except in the event of short term timing differences.
A summary of hedging positions and the interest rate exposure of the underlying financial liabilities is set out in note 19 on pages 62 and 63.
22 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Report of the Directors Share Capital During the year, the issued ordinary share capital of the company increased by 714,811 to 328,679,318.

An explanation of these resolutions is set out in the Explanation of Resolutions on pages 78 and 79. International Financial Reporting Standards The group is required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, with effect from 1 January 2005.
These new reporting standards represent a major change from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP, previously adopted by the group.
The groups 2005 interim and annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with IFRS.
A dedicated project team continues to work closely with our external auditors and other advisers to implement the accounting policies, systems and other reporting changes that will be required to ensure the group complies with IFRS.
The project has identied the following key areas affected by IFRS: Income recognition IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement Under UK GAAP, interest income is currently recognised on monthly interest-bearing products as it is charged to the customer and on pre-compute products the interest income is largely spread over the term of the loan.
Fee income and commissions on the sale of insurance products are recognised immediately, with appropriate provision for rebates due on early settlement.
Commensurate with income recognition, a proportion of loan origination costs is spread over the life of the loan.
Under IFRS, all interest income, fees and insurance commissions relating to the loan are spread over the life of the loan on an effective interest rate EIR basis.
Furthermore, only a narrow range of costs deemed to be direct and incremental are deferred under IFRS and these are also spread over the life of the loan on an EIR basis.
The revenue earned from pre-compute accounts is xed at the outset and no default interest is charged if the customer takes longer to repay.
If a customer gets into serious repayment difficulty on an interest-bearing product, interest is suspended.
IFRS however requires that interest continues to be recognised on an EIR basis.
As this interest is not charged to, or collected from, the customer it is effectively written off immediately.
The result under IFRS is a grossing up of both income and the loan loss provisioning charge.
Loan loss provisioning IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement Under UK GAAP, a long established formula based method of providing for bad debts is used.
This formula has been re-examined on an annual basis to ensure its ongoing suitability.
Under IFRS, there are prescriptive rules that require provisions to be calculated when there is evidence of impairment.
IFRS requires provisions to be calculated based on expected future cash ows over the remaining life of the loan, which are then discounted at the original EIR.
The difference between the discounted cash ows and the value of the loan in the balance sheet represents the loan loss provision.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 23 Interest rate hedging IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on financial instruments used for hedging interest rate exposures and foreign currency exposures are only recognised when the related exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging at 31 December 2004 are disclosed in note 19 on page 63.
Under IFRS, all derivatives e. g. interest rate and foreign currency swaps are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with movements in fair value booked to the profit and loss account unless the requirements for hedge accounting are met.
These requirements have been met with effect from 1 January 2005 for all significant derivatives and, therefore, hedge accounting will be applied from that date.
This means that in 2005, except for any small amounts of hedge ineffectiveness that may occur, the movements in fair value will be deferred in a hedging reserve within equity shareholders funds and released to profit in line with the underlying hedged item.
As IAS39 was not nalised until late 2004, hedge accounting was not in place prior to this and, therefore, in the 2004 restated numbers, the fair value movements will be recognised in the profit and loss account.
Pension accounting IAS19 Employee benets Under UK GAAP, the group currently accounts for dened benefit pension schemes in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The group also reports in note 8 on pages 53 to 55 the disclosures required in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement benets, including the adjustment to the net assets reported under SSAP 24 which would have been required if FRS 17 had been adopted in the financial statements.
Under IFRS, first-time adoption of IAS19 will result in a deficit, broadly similar to that reported under FRS 17, being brought onto the balance sheet.
Thereafter, actuarial gains and losses will be recognised in full as they arise, outside profit or loss, in a statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
Employee share schemes IFRS2 Share-based payment UK GAAP requires any excess of the intrinsic value the shares market value at the date of grant over the option price to be charged to the profit and loss account over the relevant performance period.
Sharesave schemes are excluded from this requirement.
Under IFRS2, share incentive schemes, including sharesave schemes, are accounted for with reference to the fair value of the options.
The charge to the profit and loss account is recognised over the relevant vesting period and is based on share options granted since 7 November 2002 to the extent that they had not vested by 1 January 2004.
Goodwill IFRS3 Business combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and trading assets is capitalised and subsequently amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years, subject to impairment reviews when evidence of impairment exists.
On transition to IFRS, IFRS1 First-time adoption requires the group to review the carrying value of capitalised goodwill for potential impairment.
IFRS3 does not permit the continued amortisation of capitalised goodwill, but instead requires it to be tested annually for impairment.
In addition, IFRS3 has a strict denition of what qualies as a business within the context of a business combination.
Goodwill relating to previous acquisitions of debt portfolios without associated infrastructure does not meet this new denition and will hence be charged to equity on transition.
Dividends IAS10 Events after the balance sheet date Under UK GAAP, dividends are recognised in the balance sheet when proposed.
IAS10 prohibits the recording of a balance sheet liability in relation to proposed distributions until the dividend has been approved.
Donations Charitable donations during the year amounted to 262,727 2003: 93,480 of which 125,028 2003: 38,176 were made to organisations addressing the issues of social disadvantage in the communities we serve and 137,699 2003: 55,304 were made to organisations seeking to improve the financial skills and general welfare of young people.
There were no political donations in either year.
24 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Report of the Directors Employment Policy The group gives sympathetic consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons wherever practicable.
Successful applicants and employees who become disabled are given appropriate assistance and training and have the same career and promotion prospects as other employees.
Details of employee involvement are set out in the Report on Corporate Social Responsibility on pages 13 and 14.
Supplier Payment Policy and Practice It is the companys policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the company and its suppliers when a binding purchase contract is entered into, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with.
At the year end, the company had an average of 14 days 2003: 12 days and the group an average of 20 days 2003: 19 days purchases outstanding in trade creditors.
Independent Auditors  LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in ofce and resolutions proposing their re-appointment as auditors and authorising the directors to determine the auditors remuneration will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
