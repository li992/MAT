EBIT also increased by 28% to $46 million, due to strong zinc prices and the successful cost efficiency programme, 17 which partially offset the weakness of the US dollar against the Euro.
18 19 Lead Europe 20 Lead production at the Northfleet refinery fell by 35% compared to 2003, due to the closure of the unprofitable No.
Despite lower levels of production, turnover remained at a similar level to 2003, at $156 million, 22 due to higher received prices for lead.
EBIT improved to $10 million from $9 million the previous year.
23 24 Silver production reduced by 19% compared to 2003 due to the lower levels of lead processed, however higher silver content, 25 up 10%, in the crude and improved process efficiencies partially mitigated the lower bullion feedstock.
26 27 Developments 28 Zinc-Lead Australia 29 At Mount Isa, capital expenditure increased to $54 million to increase production capabilities through additional mine 30 development, replacement of mobile mining equipment, and restoring the zinc-lead concentrator to nameplate capacity.
31 32 The Black Star Open Cut project has progressed well since it was approved in June 2004 and ore production is anticipated 33 to begin on schedule in the first quarter of 2005.
The project is expected to produce approximately 25 million tonnes of ore, 34 at an eventual annualised rate of 2.3 million tonnes per annum, over an 11 year life of mine.
Expected levels of production 35 have been increased from 1.5 million tonnes per annum over nine years previously, following a revised life of mine plan 36 completed in the second half of 2004.
37 38 During 2005, the lead smelter is expected to achieve its capacity throughput of 170,000 tonnes per year.
A water cooling 39 circuit is being restored to enable this level of production and minimise operating risk, and should be fully installed in 40 July 2005.
A pre-feasibility study to examine restarting the ISA smelt lead furnace will also be undertaken during 2005.

Feasibility studies for both the Open Pit at McArthur River and the associated Albion processing plant continue.
Zinc Europe 4 A new project to recover silver concentrate from the leach residue has been approved.
This will allow the smelter to treat high silver zinc concentrates and secure silver recoveries of over 80%.
The project, which has an indicative capital cost of EUR12 million $14 million, comprises the installation of new leaching tanks to improve silver and zinc recovery, a froth flotation step to recover a silver concentrate and new high pressure filters.
Project completion is expected by July 2006.
At Nordenham, the current contract with a local power supplier has been prolonged until the end of 2005.
Following successful 0 negotiations with several power suppliers, the government of Lower Saxony and the federal government in Berlin, the cost of 1 power will not increase in 2005.
2 3 Lead Europe 4 A pre-feasibility study related to expansion options for the Northfleet refinery was carried out, which showed that Britannia 5 Refined Metals BRM could handle at least double the current production levels with minimal capital investment.
6 7 As a result of this study and the shortfall in bullion supplies from Mount Isa, a unique opportunity arose to prove the current 8 refinery capacity by closing one of the refinery lines and processing through a single stream.
Through focussing on the rate 9 controlling steps and standardising the operation, cycle times have successfully been reduced from 22 hours to less than 0 14 hours, allowing production levels to be maintained from one single stream.
With further continuous improvement and 1 minor capital investment, it is expected that most of next years budgeted production of 170,000 tonnes will be processed 2 through a single stream.
3 4 Environmental improvements will be a major target for the lead business in 2005 to comply with new EU IPPC targets.
