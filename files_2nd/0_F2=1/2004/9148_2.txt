Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 3 The directors are pleased to present their report for the financial year ended 31 January 2004.
Principal activities The Group operates home improvement retail businesses in the UK, Ireland, continental Europe and Asia.
In addition, the Group has property interests in the countries in which it operates which are primarily managed through the relevant retail business.
Review of activities and future performance For Kingfisher, 2003 was a further year of transformation.
Following the announcement in May 2002 of the intention to separate its electricals and furniture business, it was demerged on the London Stock Exchange as an independent company, Kesa Electricals plc, Kesa Electricals on 7 July 2003.
In addition the small minority less than 1% of Castorama Dubois Investissements S. C. A. CDI not already owned by Kingfisher was acquired and CDI was fide-listed from Euronext Paris.
During the year, Kingfisher sold its interests in its home improvement businesses in Canada and Brazil and the NOMI home improvement business in Poland in order to concentrate on Castorama Poland, the Dubois Matriaux builders merchant business in France and closed Castorama in Belgium and Germany.
Kingfisher is now a truly international single sector business, focused exclusively on home improvement in markets that fit strategic criteria of attractive scale, structure and economics.
The main brands are B&Q, Castorama, Brico Dpt and Screwfix Direct.
The retail businesses operate in nine countries across Europe and Asia and are market leaders in five countries, giving the Group an excellent platform for growth in all of its markets.
Results and dividends The profit on ordinary activities of the Group before taxation amounted to 426.7 million 2003: 493.4 million as restated and a profit after taxation of 229.3 million 2003: 271.7 million as restated.
