This isnt the first time weve talked about change in our annual report.
For the last two years, weve told you about the need to move the company forward, and some important steps weve taken.
But in 2003 04, the pace of change within Boots accelerated dramatically.
Since last year, we have a new leadership team, and senior management structure.
Weve reduced the head office workforce by almost a third.
Weve launched new-format stores, including 19 on the edge of town.
Weve significantly reduced prices on around 2,000 products.
Weve made rapid progress with developing an entirely new store-friendly supply chain.
Weve transformed our IT capability through an innovative outsourcing deal.
And these, as youll see, are just the edited highlights.
But, at the same time, its fair to say that weve been going back to our roots.
Since the days of Jesse Boot, this company has been a part of everyday life for millions of people.
It has been well liked and trusted, above all, for its expertise in healthcare.
And it has been successful by getting the retailing basics right.
In those respects, nothing has changed.
