The Chairmans remuneration is proposed by the Chief Executive following consultation with the other Non-Executive Directors and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Fees are agreed on a standard basis for Non-Executive Directors with additional fees payable for those holding the responsibility of chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
During the year, the Chairmans and the Non-Executive Directors fees were increased to 150,000 and 35,000, respectively, but the fee for chairing a Board committee remained at 7,000.
These increases were supported by market data provided by Deloitte, and were necessary to bring the fees paid to these individuals in line with market rates, there having been no increase since August 2000 other than where a promotion took place.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company nor do they have share options, nor participate in any other Emap pension, share or incentive scheme.
Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for two, three-year terms, subject to Board and shareholder approval of reappointment at least every three years.
A third and final term of up to three years may be considered appropriate depending on circumstances and subject to Board and, if relevant, shareholder approval but any term beyond six years would be the subject of a particularly rigorous review.
