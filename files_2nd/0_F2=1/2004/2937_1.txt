Making tomorrow a better place Carillion plc is one of the UKs leading support services and construction companies employing over 19,000 people in the UK and overseas, generating sales of nearly 2 billion per annum.
Since we were launched and listed on the London Stock Exchange as an independent company in 1999, we have had a clear vision, a consistent strategy and strong values.
We were one of the first companies to recognise the benefits of combining construction excellence with maintenance, support services and private finance to provide high-quality integrated solutions to meet the long-term needs of our customers.
Five years ago we were predominantly a construction company.
Today we generate around half our turnover and over two thirds of our profit from support services and from equity investments in public private partnership PPP projects.
Changing our business mix and introducing rigorous new management procedures have significantly improved the risk profile of our activities and the predictability of our earnings.
Our portfolio includes many high-profile projects in the UK and overseas projects like the new Government Communications Headquarters, Cheltenham, new hospitals like the John Radcliffe in Oxford, the upgrading of large sections of the UK rail network such as the West Coast Mainline, construction of the M6 Toll motorway and maintenance of the M25.
We also provide facilities management services for 10 NHS hospitals and for around 100 million square feet of other government and commercial property, including 8,000 properties for BT.
In Canada, we are building two of its first PPP hospitals and maintaining a substantial proportion of the provincial road network in Ontario.
In the Middle East, we are building large parts of the multi-billion pound Festival City development and growing a substantial facilities management business.
