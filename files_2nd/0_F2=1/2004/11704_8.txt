UK reserves as of 31 December 2004 include Ross and Blake.
Quantification of reserves is based on the Companys own estimates supported by operators and third party experts estimates.
In addition, a report on the Groups reserves is conducted annually by an independent engineer as part of the Companys obligations to its bankers.
The reserves in the tables above and below represent the Groups entitlement to commercial proven plus probable reserves, as defined in the SORP.
On a working interest basis, Indonesian reserves at 31 December 2004 would increase by 8.1 MMboe to 31.8 MMboe and total Group reserves would increase to148 MMboe.
As was the case in previous years, the Company has assumed that the Indonesian PSCs will be extended to enable all commercial reserves to be produced.
Quantities of oil equivalent are calculated on an energy equivalent basis for the purpose of the above tables and for depreciation and depletion calculations.
A gas-to-oil conversion factor of 6,000 standard cubic feet of natural gas per barrel of oil equivalent is used.
The following movements in proven and probable reserves occurred in 2004, with comparative figures provided for 2003: MMboe MMboe Reserves at 1 January 132.7 108.2 Proven and probable reserves at 31 December MMboe Produced during the year 15.2 15.3 Acquisitions 12.8 37.5 Disposals 1.2 Revisions to estimates 9.6 3.5 Reserves at 31 December 139.9 132.7 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 38.2 63.1 108.2 132.7 139.9 Average daily production boepd 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 6,940 18,255 29,117 42,006 41,410 Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 19
