9 0 Developments 1 Australia 2 For 2004, Xstrata Coal Australias capital expenditure totalled AUD325 million $240 million.
The key projects to which this 3 capital expenditure relates include: 4 5 further development of the Rolleston project, with the commencement of expenditure in the first half of 2004, following 6 Board approval in February: 7 continued development of the new Northern underground mine at the Newlands complex.
The mine, which will replace 8 production from the existing Southern underground mine, will be completed in late 2005 with full production scheduled 9 for early 2006: 0 the purchase and reconstruction of a dragline for overburden removal at the Eastern Creek pit at the Newlands complex.
1 Operations are expected to commence in January 2005: and 2 commencement of work to implement a $68 million state-of-the-art longwall system together with a $16 million 3 underground drift conveyor system at the Ulan underground coal mine.
The new longwall system will enable Ulan to 4 operate as one of the lowest cost underground mines in Australia.
5 6 The commissioning of the Rolleston coal mine remains on time, following approval from the Board in February 2004 to develop 7 the long life, open-cut, export and domestic thermal coal operation.
Rolleston enjoys a rapid development profile, with first 8 production of some one million tonnes expected in 2005, and full production on a managed basis of six million export tonnes 9 per annum and two million tonnes domestic production expected in 2008.

In addition, a project for the replacement of the existing Newlands coal handling preparation plant 3 with a new Dense Medium Cyclone DMC plant will commence.
This project will enable the production of coking coal product 4 from the current reserves and will provide additional capacity to coincide with the commencement of the Northern Underground 5 mine.
Furthermore, the coal processing facilities at Bulga and Mount Owen will receive significant upgrades enabling increased 6 throughput and cost savings.
7 8 South Africa 9 Evaluation of two major projects commenced in 2004: namely the Goedgevonden mine and the Verkeerdepan extension to 10 the Tselentis operation, with significant work undertaken on each during the year.
11 12 A total of ZAR410m $65 million was directed to capital expenditure for Xstrata Coals South African operations in 2004.
13 This expenditure relates to a number of key projects including a $8 million project to gain access to a new mining area at 14 WitCons scheduled for completion in the first half of 2005 and the purchase of a total of five new continuous miners at 15 South Witbank, Tavistock and Boschmans to replace older technology units and improve productivity at a total cost of around 16 $13 million.
17 18 Capital expenditure in South Africa is expected to increase in 2005 due to the continued development of the Goedgevonden 19 project and the Verkeerdepan extension.
20 21 The go-ahead for the expansion of the Richards Bay Coal Terminal was again delayed.
This was due to further delays by Transnet 22 and Spoornet in both negotiating the renewal of the export coal industry rail agreement, due to expire at the end of March 23 2005, and approving the capital required to expand the coal rail system.
The appointment of a new Transnet Board and recent 24 changes in Spoornets senior management should see the satisfactory progression of these issues in the first half of 2005.
25 26 In accordance with the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act, which was enacted on 1 May 2004, Xstrata Coal 27 is continuing its commitment to transformation in its South African business, having made progress in all areas addressed by 28 the South African Governments Scorecard, including plans to address the participation of black economic empowerment 29 groups in the ownership of assets.

2 The LME cash copper price averaged 130US per pound for the year, an increase of 38% on 2003 and the highest annual 3 average since 1995.
Global copper demand recorded the highest ever increase in tonnage terms and the fastest annual 4 growth rate since 1979.
5 6 The surge in refined copper demand helped to eliminate most of the remaining exchange stocks of copper.
Stocks at the LME, 7 Comex and Shanghai exchanges saw a substantial decrease from 820,000 tonnes at the beginning of 2004 to just 129,000 8 tonnes by year end.
The shortfall between world refined copper supply and global demand widened to more than 800,000 9 tonnes in 2004, compared to a deficit of around 300,000 tonnes over the corresponding period in 2003.
10 11 For copper raw materials, the second half of the year saw a reversal of the conditions experienced in the first half.
The mine 12 disruptions and curtailments that helped to generate extreme copper concentrate shortages in the first half of 2004 were more 13 than offset in the second six months of the year.
Mine restarts, together with a surge in new supply principally in the second 14 half of the year, increased production by more than one million tonnes versus the previous year.
This increase in copper 15 concentrate supply was further compounded by smelter problems and cutbacks.
16 17 Correspondingly, smelter treatment and refining charges TC RCs jumped from record lows at the end of the first quarter 18 to seven year highs above $130 per dry metric tonne and 13US per pound by year end.
The sharp growth in mine supply 19 outpaced available smelting capacity and generated a considerable global surplus of copper concentrates.
The copper scrap 20 market also eased in line with rising economic activity and increased availability of concentrates.
21 22 Copper concentrate sales from Xstratas Australian operations in North Queensland were 155,900 dry metric tonnes in 2004 23 compared to 226,100 dry metric tonnes the previous year.
The reduction reflects improved performance at the Mount Isa 24 smelting operations.
A decision to replace Mount Isa copper concentrate exports with Ernest Henry copper concentrate 25 delivered significant logistics and transportation benefits along with a reduction in working capital.
26 27 Increased smelter utilisation and the absence of a re-brick led to a 17% lift in 2004 refined own copper sales to 28 241,790 tonnes.
Domestic copper cathode sales from Xstratas North Queensland operations were also significantly 29 higher at 101,800 tonnes, compared to 48,600 tonnes in 2003.
30 31 Xstratas share of concentrate sales from Alumbrera 50% eased to 347,000 dry metric tonnes in 2004 from 360,400 dry 32 metric tonnes in 2003 as a result of lower head grades.
Xstratas share of contained copper in concentrate reduced to 33 88,220 tonnes compared to 99,270 tonnes the previous year.
34 35 Sales of gold contained in North Queensland copper products copper concentrates and tankhouse slimes totalled 148,700 ounces 36 for the year, compared with 131,600 ounces in 2003.
This increase reflects higher production at Ernest Henry.
37 38 The global copper concentrate market is expected to remain in surplus in 2005 due to concentrate supply continuing to exceed 39 smelting capacity.
In addition, numerous planned smelter maintenance shutdowns in the first half of this year should help 40 41 51 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:39 am Page 52 operating and financial review | copper Consolidated Financial and Operating Data: Copper Statutory Pro forma year ended year ended $m 31.12.04 31.12.03 4 Turnover 1,598.3 1,057.1 Australia 874.1 550.5 South America 724.2 506.6 EBITDA 856.7 481.8 Australia 369.0 149.5 South America 487.7 332.3 0 Depreciation & amortisation 212.4 207.7 1 Australia 93.5 67.3 2 South America 118.9 140.4 3 EBIT 644.3 274.1 4 Australia 275.5 82.2 5 South America 368.8 191.9 6 7 Attributable net assets 1,733.9 1,619.8 8 Australia 1,095.6 1,048.8 9 South America 638.3 571.0 0 Capital employed 1,814.9 1,897.6 1 Australia 1,095.6 1,048.8 2 South America 719.3 848.8 3 Share of Group EBIT 42.9% 63.6% 4 Australia 18.4% 19.1% 5 South America 24.5% 44.5% 6 Share of Group net assets 21.7% 24.9% 7 Australia 13.7% 16.1% 8 Local people gather for a South America 8.0% 8.8% community consultation session 9 close to the site of the Las Bambas Return on capital employed 36.7% 15.6% 0 project in southern Peru Australia 26.6% 9.1% 1 Mount Isa skyline at dusk from South America 51.3% 22.6% 2 the city lookout Capital expenditure 99.3 82.1 3 Australia 73.1 61.8 4 Minera Alumbrera processing plant and facilities in Catamarca South America 26.2 20.3 5 Province, North West Argentina 6 Sustaining 94.6 48.3 7 Expansionary 4.7 33.8 8 Pro forma includes MIM Group acquisition from 01.01.03 9 Excludes Las Bambas project acquisition 100% consolidated figures 40 Excludes discontinued operations Avonmouth, Forestry and Magnesium 41 ROCE % based on average exchange rates for the period 52 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:39 am Page 53 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 | 53 1 Production data: Copper Statutory Pro forma 2 year ended year ended 31.12.04 31.12.03 3 Australia Ernest Henry 4 Material mined t 58,140,940 64,893,365 5 Ore mined t 11,166,159 9,715,633 6 Copper head grade % 1.14 1.05 Gold head grade g t 0.56 0.53 7 Ore treated t 10,799,276 10,279,221 8 Concentrate produced t 392,045 345,477 9 Copper in concentrate t 114,007 99,422 10 Gold in concentrate oz 142,616 122,580 11 Australia Mount Isa 12 Ore mined t 5,402,648 5,172,880 Copper head grade % 3.37 3.49 13 Ore treated t 5,481,698 5,186,464 14 Concentrate produced from ore t 654,102 654,345 15 Copper in concentrate from ore t 170,197 176,997 16 Anode copper t 236,252 212,585 Refined copper t 237,621 211,391 17 North Queensland cash cost C1 post by-product credits US lb 59.4 49.0 18 South America Alumbrera 19 Material mined t 111,641,485 110,213,939 20 Ore mined t 32,182,529 30,621,193 21 Copper head grade % 0.56 0.65 22 Gold head grade % 0.72 0.81 Ore treated t 35,353,521 34,200,389 23 Concentrate produced t 654,366 753,474 24 Copper in concentrate t 176,439 198,537 25 Gold in concentrate oz 583,568 615,556 26 Gold in dor oz 49,598 54,208 Total gold oz 633,166 669,764 27 Cash cost C1 post by-product credits US lb 6.0 3.1 28 Copper and gold sales volumes 29 Australia North Queensland 30 Refined copper t 241,790 206,154 31 Copper in concentrate t payable metal 43,245 61,043 32 Third party sourced t payable metal 181 22,056 Total copper t payable metal 285,216 289,253 33 Gold in concentrate and slimes oz payable metal 148,659 131,577 34 South America Alumbrera 35 Copper in concentrate t payable metal 179,361 182,945 36 Gold in concentrate oz payable metal 597,262 570,122 37 Gold in dor oz payable metal 45,270 49,950 Total gold oz payable metal 642,531 620,072 38 Average LME copper price $ t 2,866 1,779 39 Average LBM gold price $ oz 409 364 40 Pro forma includes MIM Group acquisition from 01.01.03 41 100% consolidated figures Includes mined ore only and excludes impact of reprocessed slag 53 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:39 am Page 54 54 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 operating and financial review | copper maintain TC RCs near historically high levels.
In the face of expected strong refined copper demand, this production bottleneck will keep the refined copper market tight and cathode premiums buoyant.
Macroeconomic indicators are pointing to slowing conditions towards the second half of 2005.
However copper prices are likely 4 to remain well supported until copper warehouse stocks rise from their critically low levels.
Continued US dollar weakness will also maintain speculative interest in the copper market.
In line with the recent growth in mine supply and forecasts for slowing economic growth, the global refined copper deficit is forecast to narrow sharply in 2005.
South America The strong financial performance of the Alumbrera business was achieved as a result of high copper prices and productivity 0 improvements.
EBIT doubled from $192 million to $369 million in 2004 and EBITDA increased from $332 million to $488 1 million.
Higher realised copper prices helped to drive turnover up by 30% to $724 million compared to last year.
Performance 2 was characterised by lower production volumes as head grades declined toward life of mine averages as scheduled, with the 3 impact mitigated by a combination of increased ore throughputs, further cost efficiency initiatives and improved prices.
4 5 Mill throughput was 3% higher than the corresponding period last year due mainly to the successful commissioning of a third 6 flotation circuit in the concentrator towards the end of the first half, which has increased throughput rates and improved overall 7 metallurgical performance.
Material mined was marginally higher, and ore mined was 5% higher than last year.
8 9  and total gold production for 2004 was 176,400 tonnes and 583,600 ounces respectively, which was 0 lower than the corresponding period in 2003 primarily due to lower head grades.
1 2 Low operating unit costs continued to be a highlight of the Alumbrera business in 2004, with C1 cash operating costs averaging 3 6US per pound of copper produced net of gold credits.
The increase in C1 cash costs from 3.1US per pound in 2003 is the 4 result of the lower ore grades, higher smelting and refining charges, higher sea freight rates as well as higher contracted power 5 and consumables costs.
6 7 Australia 8 The financial performance of the North Queensland copper division reflected strong copper prices and the results of the 9 successful transformation of the business to improve productivity, safety and operational efficiency, following the formation of 0 the single global copper business in January 2004.
EBIT was up approximately 235% to $276 million from $82 million in 2003 1 as a result of the business transformation programme, which yielded increased production in the second half, and stronger 2 copper prices.
EBITDA increased by approximately 150% to $369 million from $150 million in the corresponding period.
3 4 In the Mount Isa copper operations, lower head grades were offset by a 6% increase in the ore tonnage milled.
The average 5 copper head grade was 3.37% compared with 3.49% in 2003, with 5.5 million tonnes of ore milled in 2004 compared with 6 5.2 million tonnes in the previous year.
Increased mine development and stope filling programmes initiated during the first half 7 of 2004 allowed the achievement of higher production levels in the second half of the year, with further gains expected in 2005.
8 9 At the Ernest Henry operation, copper head grade improved to 1.14% compared with 1.05% in the prior year and total mill 40 throughput achieved was 5% higher than 2003.
