Savings-Related Share Option Scheme A UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme will continue to be open to all eligible employees, including executive directors, in the UK.
Jean-Nol Labroue participated under a similar scheme for French employees.
As is the case with all savings-related share option schemes open to all employees, there are no performance criteria provisions.

In accordance with the terms of his appointment, the value of the award was 360,000 as of the date of his appointment and the number of shares awarded was based on the Companys share price of 192.5p on that date 3 February 2003.
2 Awards were granted on 17 April 2003 when the share price was 239.17p before the 7 for 8 consolidation in July 2003.
3 No matching shares vest for below median performance.
561,039 is the maximum number of matching shares which may vest for upper quartile TSR performance over the three-year performance period reducing to one-third for median performance.
4 If Gerry Murphys employment terminates before 1 February 2006 by reason of death, injury, ill health, early termination by Kingfisher other than for cause or resignation for good reason as defined in his service contract, then the investment shares will vest at that date and, subject to the discretion of the Committee in certain limited circumstances, such of the matching shares as can be treated as vested, taking into account TSR performance up to the date of cessation of his employment, but reduced on a time pro-rated basis.
No variations to the terms and conditions of the awards were made during the year and no awards vested or lapsed during the year.
If Gerry Murphy chooses to invest his own funds in the Companys shares at the beginning of the 2004 5 and 2005 6 financial years up to a limit of one-third of his base salary in any year and meets the required TSR performance targets in the three-year period following the date of purchase, he will also be awarded Matching Shares up to a maximum of three times the number of shares he has purchased.
Gerry Murphy has already invested the one-third of his base salary required in respect of the financial year just commenced.
Closed incentive plans There are two further long-term incentive plans, the Incentive Growth Plan IGP and the Kingfisher Incentive Plan KIP, which are now closed and under which no further awards will be made, but where there are amounts outstanding from prior awards these may still become due at the end of their respective performance cycles or deferral periods.
Any such amounts will be paid, before the plans are wound up.
The full details of each can be found in previous Annual Reports.
