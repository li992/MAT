reserves Reserves The Groups proved and probable reserves by region as at 31 December 2004, and changes during the year, are shown below.
Entitlement reserves represent Burrens share of expected future production net of Government share in that production under the terms of the PSCs in question.
Government production share is impacted inter alia by assumptions as to future oil prices.
Burrens PSCs all provide for the Operators costs to be substantially recovered via a priority allocation of oil production the Cost Oil.
As oil prices increase, the amount of Cost Oil required to recover past costs reduces, thereby reducing the Operators share in production and so reducing reserves.
Working Interest reserves represent the percentage of future production before deducting Government share attributable to Burrens joint venture participating interest.

P. who have confirmed in writing that they have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted procedures for the estimation of future reserves, and that the proved reserves correspond to the denition used by the Society of Petroleum Engineers World Petroleum Congress SPE WPC.
No estimation has been made of the Groups gas reserves, owing to the absence of a gas sales agreement necessary for commercialisation.
Entitlement reserves at 31 December 2004 were computed using an assumed Brent oil price of US$25 bbl from 2006 onwards, whereas at 31 December 2003 a price of US$19 bbl was assumed for this period.
The effect of this increase in assumed future oil prices has been to reduce Group entitlement reserves by 13.6 million bbls, although the monetary value of the Groups reserves has increased.
The above table does not include any reserves attributable to Burrens 26% interest of HOEC.
As at 31 March 2005, according to HOEC management estimates, HOEC proven and probable reserves were 34.0 million barrels of oil equivalent boe on an entitlement basis and 40.0 million boe on a working interest basis.
