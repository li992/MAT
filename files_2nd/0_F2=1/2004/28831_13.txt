On the balance sheet, the main change is that under IFRS we are required to recognise the surpluses and deficits of our George Culmer Chief Financial officer pension funds, calculated annually under IAS 19.
This standard has a very similar impact on the balance sheet to the FRS 17 supplementary analysis that we already provide in the report and accounts.
There has been much debate about this, primarily because of the potential volatility in the number.
For the Group this would at the beginning of 2004 have represented a net deficit of approximately 0.5bn.
Following our exit during 2004 from the life sector, the number of our policies affected by IFRS 4 is minimal, with the exception of the change in classication of some contracts, which will now be recognised as financial instruments under IAS 39.
We have a number of such contracts primarily in the US, which all relate to the collateralised debt obligation portfolios, or CDOs.
