Efficiency and productivity improvements were achieved across a number of operations and several mines achieved 22 new production records and substantial improvements in performance over the previous year.
Some 45% of the efficiency gains 23 were associated with Xstrata Coals New South Wales operations, with South Africa and Queensland accounting for 30% and 24 25% respectively.
I am delighted to note that Xstratas Beltana and Newlands underground longwall mines are now the lowest 25 cost mines of this type in Australia an indication of Xstrata Coals operating excellence.
Demurrage costs incurred in the first 26 half of the year were significantly reduced following the introduction of the capacity allocation scheme at the Newcastle Port 27 in New South Wales, which Xstrata, together with other companies, was instrumental in establishing.
28 29 At the start of the year, Xstrata Copper was established as a single global commodity business, led by Charlie Sartain.
Working 30 with Santiago Zaldumbide on the zinc-lead business, Charlie and his team have made great progress in transforming the former 31 MIM operations in North Queensland in 2004, improving profitability and securing the longer-term future of these assets.
32 33 The significant turn-around in the performance of the Queensland copper operations has been particularly impressive.
34 In real terms a $52 million unit cost improvement was achieved mainly as a result of substantial improvements in operating 35 throughput achieved in the copper smelter, together with substantial cost savings relative to 2003.
In addition, the increased 36 volumes contributed over $7.5 million to the operating profit of the Queensland copper businesses, particularly at Mount Isa 37 where the production of copper ore had reached an annualised rate of 6.2 million tonnes by year end.
38 39 Across both the copper and zinc-lead businesses at Mount Isa, a comprehensive programme addressed overdue stope 40 development and filling work, concentrator availabilities, smelter metallurgical performance, contractor management and safety 41 performance, as well as the development of the Northern 3500 underground copper orebody and the Black Star zinc-lead open 7 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:37 am Page 8 08 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 chief executives report pit mine to improve utilisation of fixed plant capacities.
The higher costs incurred as a result of some of these initiatives in the first half bore fruit later in the year, as improved operational efficiency and increased production allowed Xstrata to capitalise on the very strong copper prices prevailing in 2004 and in the first few months of 2005.
4 During the course of the year, the process of business transformation and organisational change in North Queensland concluded successfully with the transfer of complete management control of the Mount Isa zinc-lead business to Xstrata Zinc.
The revitalisation of the copper and zinc-lead businesses at Mount Isa owes a great deal to the devolvement of management responsibility back into the operations themselves and the establishment of profit centres and clear lines of accountability across the former base metals assets of MIM in North Queensland.
0 The ongoing coke reduction programme initiated by Xstrata Alloys continues to make a significant contribution to mitigating 1 the very strong price increases for reductants experienced in our ferrochrome business, and achieved savings of over $11 million 2 in 2004.
Xstrata Alloys strategy of securing its supply of reductants and insulating the business from cost increases as far as 3 possible will reap further cost benefits in 2005, following the acquisition of African Char Group, a South African char producer, 4 in January 2005.
5 6 Major internal growth projects 7 One of the successes of 2004 has been the expansion of the Groups pipeline of internal growth, with four large-scale new 8 expansion projects, one in each of our commodity businesses, launched during the year.
The estimated total capital cost for 9 these projects is some $650 million, with expenditure of $250 million in 2004.
Two of the four projects hold significant, 0 low-cost and lower risk brownfield expansion potential, which will underpin growth in our South African ferrochrome and 1 Queensland thermal coal businesses for many years to come.
2 3 Alloys 4 Construction has begun on the first stage of Project Lion, with initial production expected mid-2006 and full production 5 of 360,000 tonnes per annum in the final quarter of 2007.
The project will benefit from Xstrata Alloys proprietary Premus 6 technology, which will deliver significant cost savings compared to prevailing ferrochrome production technologies and ensure 7 returns in excess of our cost of capital at every point in the commodity price cycle.
Depending on the level of participation of 8 our chrome venture partner, Merafe Resources, Xstrata will hold between 75% and 85% of the project, which will consolidate 9 Xstrata Alloys position as the worlds largest and most efficient producer of ferrochrome.
0 1 Phases two and three of Project Lion, which have the potential to provide a further 650,000 tonnes of annual capacity, will 2 be sequenced over the next eight to ten years as market conditions require.
3 4 Coal 5 The development of the new open-cut thermal coal mine at Rolleston in Queensland, Australia, remains on schedule, with 6 production of one million tonnes of coal expected in 2005, and full production of six million export tonnes and two million 7 domestic tonnes expected in 2008.
The project has estimated Identified Coal Resources of approximately 600 million tonnes 8 including 173 million tonnes of recoverable coal reserves, providing Xstrata Coal with a long-life, low-cost asset with a rapid 9 development profile.
40 41 8 0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:37 am Page 9 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 | 09 A distinctive feature of our Australian coal business remains the inherent brownfield expansion potential of the operations.
1 In Queensland, the Rolleston coal operation holds brownfield potential for a further 50% expansion to 12 million tonnes a 2 year, with low capital expenditure associated mainly with the purchase of another drag line.
In New South Wales, the Group 3 is superbly positioned to grow its production through a combination of small expansion projects and flexible working practices 4 by over five million tonnes.
Most of this production can be brought on with short timeframes and minimal capital expenditure.
5 6 Copper 7 Xstrata Coppers acquisition of an option to develop a mine at Las Bambas in Southern Peru in August 2004 for $91 million 8 reflects our commitment to growing Xstratas copper business and provides an excellent opportunity to assess this potentially 9 world-class resource.
In March 2005 Xstrata began the largest drilling programme in South America this year to define better 10 this resource.
In Argentina, the team at Alumbrera confirmed an additional 80 million tonnes of ore reserves at Alumbrera 11 during 2004, which further extended metal production from this low-cost, highly efficient mine until 2015.
Additional intensive 12 resource-definition work will continue this year.
13 14 Xstrata Copper holds an option to acquire up to 62.5% of the Tampakan copper-gold deposit in the Philippines, exercisable 15 until December 2007.
A scoping study has been completed on the project by Xstratas partner, Indophil Resources.
We were 16 recently encouraged by the Supreme Courts ruling in the Philippines that a law opening the mining industry to foreign 17 investors was constitutional.
Another positive development has been the publication with independent Competent Person 18 sign-off of a Mineral Resource inventory totalling 900 million tonnes at 0.7 per cent copper and 0.3 grams per tonne gold 19 at a 0.4% copper cut-off, which revealed the emerging scale of this deposit.
20 21 Zinc 22 The development of the new Black Star zinc-lead open pit mine was approved at the end of the first half, as one of a number 23 of initiatives to improve returns and secure the long-term viability of the operations at Mount Isa.
Planning and pre-stripping 24 have remained on time and within budget and first ore production is now underway.
Original expectations of annual production 25 from the mine have been increased by over 50% to 2.3 million tonnes per annum over an 11 year life of mine, with further 26 reserve extensions also expected.
This low capital cost project will supplement production from the existing George Fisher zinc-lead 27 mine, to utilise the full capacity of the zinc-lead concentrator at Mount Isa and achieve further operational efficiencies.
28 29 Xstrata Zinc continues to assess options in respect of an expansion of the McArthur River Mine MRM in the Northern Territory, 30 Australia, with feasibility studies underway into a possible open-pit and associated Albion Plant.
Given current zinc prices and 31 the significant improvements that have been achieved in producing a more saleable concentrate, MRM is profitable.
However, 32 the business model of the operation faces the significant challenge posed by the ongoing closure of ISF smelters, which are the 33 only purchasers of the bulk concentrate produced by MRM.
34 35 Further growth remains available at the San Juan smelter in Spain, with potential for the use of direct leaching to increase 36 annual capacity by around 45,000 tonnes to 537,000 tonnes.
37 38 A rigorous assessment of any projects long-term return on capital remains the key hurdle for approval of any of the growth 39 projects within the business, and Xstrata remains committed to maintaining this discipline in assessing the future of any 40 potential or existing project, irrespective of prevailing commodity prices.
