Investment Managers Review Portfolio Review New Investments Under Electras current investment policy, two thirds of cash realised from the portfolio existing at June 2001 is to be returned to shareholders.
The remaining balance of cash realised is available for followon and new investments and investments in funds managed by Electra Partners.
Up to the end of the 2004 financial year, demand for reinvestment in portfolio companies has meant that limited funds have been available for new investments.
As the portfolio declines in size this demand will reduce allowing more funds to become available for adding new investments to the portfolio.

In March 2004, Electra invested 14.9 million in Baxi Holdings in order to preserve an exposure to this business and take advantage of the future upside potential.

Performance The portfolio performed consistently throughout the year and over the period recorded net appreciation of 14%.
The year thus saw a welcome return to positive progress after three years of decline.
Over the year the portfolio appreciated by 78 million.
This appreciation included 103 million of realised gains from the sale of portfolio investments and 6 million of unrealised gains on restricted listed securities.
These gains were, however, offset by currency depreciation of 13 million and a reduction in unrealised appreciation of 18 million.
The majority of the current depreciation was, however, hedged through currency borrowings.
While the realisation programme gave rise to a high level of realised gains there were also some significant increases in unrealised appreciation of investments remaining in the portfolio.
The two most significant individual increases were those relating to the investments in Inchcape Shipping Services and Freightliner.

This included full provision against the investments in Deutsche Woolworth and Leisure Parcs, both of which were made in the first half of the financial year.
In the case of Deutsche Woolworth, the provision was made in view of the difficult trading conditions in Germany.
Other provisions were made primarily against a number of older investments to reflect, in some cases, volatility in profit and, in other cases, uncertain prospects for profitable realisation.
In aggregate, the provisions made against the value of investments exceeded the increases in unrealised profits by 18 million.
This resulted in a reduction in the value of unlisted investments held throughout the year of 5.1%.
