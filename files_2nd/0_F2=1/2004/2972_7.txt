The main financial risks faced by the Group are those of interest rate, exchange rate and liquidity.
The Group manages interest rate risk by placing Interest Rate Swap Agreements against 75% of loan debt, the rest being liable to interest at the prevailing rate.
Foreign exchange risk is minimised by a purchasing goods for resale in Sterling and b utilising the European cash flows to settle loan repayments required in Euros.
In respect of liquidity risk, the Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through overdraft facilities.
Daily cash balances are forecasted and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with our bankers at commercial rates, all accounts having at least a double-A rating.

13 Annual General Meeting In addition to resolutions to adopt the accounts, declare a final dividend, approve the Directors remuneration report, re-elect Directors and re-appoint the auditors, five further resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The first is to give the Directors general power to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 231,855 equal to approximately 33.3% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority, which will lapse at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, but retain the authority to do so.
The second is to disapply the statutory rights of pre-emption contained in section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to rights issues and issues for cash not exceeding 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital.
The Directors consider it desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power which will terminate at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The third resolution will renew an existing authority which gives the Company power to purchase its own shares within limits as to number of shares and price.
The Directors will only exercise the authority if they are satisfied that any purchase will increase the earnings per share of the Ordinary share capital in issue and will be in the interests of the shareholders.
Options over 220,650 Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company were outstanding as at 22 June 2004 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report representing 0.32% of the issued share capital of the Company as at that date.
If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for which they are seeking authority under the proposed resolution, the options outstanding as at 22 June 2004 would represent 0.35% of the Ordinary share capital in issue following such exercise.
The fourth resolution is to consider and, if thought fit, approve the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The fifth resolution is to consider and, if thought fit, approve the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
