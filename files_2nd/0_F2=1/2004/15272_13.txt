b Options granted under the Longer-Term Performance Share Plan at 300 pence total exercise price conditional upon a performance target that has been achieved.
c Options granted under the Yule Catto Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
d Options granted under the Yule Catto Performance Share Plan at 200 pence total exercise price conditional upon a performance target that has still to be achieved.
Performance targets are as follows: i For awards made in 2002 an award will vest in respect of 100 per cent of the shares only if the companys adjusted earnings per share over a three year period ending on 31 December 2004 has increased by at least 50% compared with the companys adjusted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2001 with adjusted earnings per share to be calculated on a consistent basis.
The award will not vest in respect of any shares unless the companys earnings per share over the same period has increased by at least 30 per cent at which point the award will vest in respect of 30 per cent of the shares under the award.
The proportion of the award which will vest for an increase in the companys earnings per share over the same period between 30 per cent and 50 per cent will be calculated on a straight line basis.
ii For awards made in 2003 an award will vest in respect of 100 per cent of the shares only if the companys adjusted earnings per share over a three year period ending on 31 December 2005 has increased by more than the annual rise in RPI plus 6% per annum compound compared with the companys adjusted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2002 with adjusted earnings per share to be calculated on a consistent basis.
The award will not vest in respect of any shares unless the companys earnings per share over the same period had increased by at least the annual rise in RPI plus 3% per annum compound at which point the award will vest in respect of 30 per cent of the shares under the award.
The proportion of the award which will vest for an increase in the companys earnings per share over the same period between these points will be calculated on a straight line basis.
iii When setting the performance conditions for awards made in 2004 the Remuneration Committee was conscious that in setting such conditions it must take into account the fact that the companys results in 2003 were boosted by the launch of generic omeprazole in the USA.
Accordingly the conditions in 2004 were based upon the 2003 adjusted earnings per share figure of 27.6p reduced by 7.6p to take account of this highly unusual factor but otherwise in accordance with the performance conditions for 2003. e Options originally granted over shares in Holliday Chemical Holdings PLC and which were exchanged for options over an equivalent number of shares in Yule Catto & Co plc under the terms of the Roll-over offer.
The notional value of unexercised share options is based on the mid-market price of a share on 31 December 2004 of 283.5 pence.
During the year the market price ranged between 218.0 pence and 296.5 pence.
