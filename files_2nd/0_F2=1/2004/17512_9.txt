During 2004, 3.4 million shares 0.5% of ordinary share capital were purchased under the ECMP for $51 million.
19 No shares were sold under the ECMP during 2004.
20 21 Future Application of Xstrata Shares Held by Batiss 22 Xstrata Capital intends that the shares held by Batiss will either be used by the Group as a source of financing for future 23 acquisitions, in keeping with the Groups growth strategy, or placed in the market.
24 25 The decision when to place the shares in the market, use the shares to assist the Group in facilitating future transactions, 26 or to repurchase shares for cancellation, will be considered in light of the Groups funding requirements and capital structure 27 at the time.
28 29 Accounting Treatment 30 For so long as the shares continue to be held by Batiss they are disregarded for the purposes of calculating the earnings per 31 share of Xstrata plc.
Batiss will be consolidated by Xstrata as a quasi-subsidiary, and the shares held by it will be accounted 32 for as a deduction from shareholders funds in the consolidated balance sheet of the Group.
33 34 If Xstrata shares held by Batiss are subsequently disposed of by way of a placing or as consideration for an acquisition by 35 the Group, any gain or loss will be taken directly to the Groups reserves to the extent that the market value of the shares 36 so disposed is above or below the cost of those shares.
No gain or loss would be recognised in the consolidated profit and 37 loss account of the Group.

Continued growth in the production of stainless steel, which accounts for around 80% 3 of global ferrochrome consumption, was the main driver for this increase.
In China stainless steel melt grew by around 24% 4 during the year, strongly underpinning the higher demand.
5 6 Strong stainless steel melt growth was also evident in Europe, estimated at around 8.9 million tonnes in 2004, an increase 7 of 6% versus the previous year, in South Korea where melt grew by 16% to 2.3 million tonnes per annum and in the United 8 States, with an annual increase of around 8% to 2.4 million tonnes.
9 10 Quoted European base prices for ferrochrome increased by almost 30% from 57US per pound in the first quarter of 2004 to 11 73US per pound in the final quarter of the year.
Ferrochrome prices were supported by strong demand, with price increases 12 also reflecting significant increases in cost drivers experienced by producers during the year, including a stronger South African 13 rand, higher metallurgical coke prices and rising sea freight rates.
14 15 The outlook for ferrochrome demand and prices for 2005 remains strong, with stainless melt forecast to continue to increase 16 by around 9% in 2005 and no meaningful increase in ferrochrome production capacity expected before Xstratas Lion Project 17 comes on stream in 2006.

EBIT improved by over 140% 4 to $149 million.
5 6 2004 was a challenging year for all major South African producers from an operating perspective, given the dramatic rise in 7 the cost of key raw material inputs during the period and a decline in metallurgical efficiencies, due principally to transformer 8 failures and electricity supply reliability issues, together with a shortage of quality chrome ore.
The sharp rise in the cost of 9 reductants primarily coke had the greatest negative impact of approximately $43 million on costs in 2004, offset to some 0 extent by the success of Xstratas coke reduction programme which resulted in savings of around $11 million.
Despite these 1 setbacks, unit costs increased by only $17 million in real terms and higher received prices drove EBIT up by over 140% to 2 $149 million, which more than offset the impact of a strong South African rand.
3 4 Xstrata has continued to enhance its relative cost competitiveness by increasing ore agglomeration capacity, securing a captive 5 supply of reductants, improving the energy efficiency of capacity expansions and aggressively pursuing a general reduction in 6 unit costs.
7 8 Challenging geological conditions at the Western mines reduced mine output and lowered head grades during the period, 9 giving rise to the shortage of quality chrome ore mentioned above.
An open cast mining section was opened in the latter part 0 of 2004 to produce 80,000 tonnes ROM of chrome ore per month.
This initiative is expected to make a significant contribution 1 towards alleviating ore supply and associated quality difficulties in 2005.
Ratanang Care Centre one of 2 three care centres for orphans 3 As announced in November 2004, the two Samancor joint venture furnaces at Wonderkop were temporarily closed on funded by Xstrata in South Africa 4 1 December 2004 for routine maintenance.
It is envisaged that these furnaces will only be returned to production around In-house project team 5 August 2005, due to the elevated power costs that are specific to these furnaces.
The closure had no material financial rebuilding furnace 6 implication for Xstrata in 2004 and is not expected to impact 2005 financial performance materially.

The PSV reinforces Xstratas position as a market leader 19 with total managed annual capacity increasing by 240,000 tonnes to a total of 1.4 million tonnes per annum, excluding the 20 existing joint venture with Samancor.
21 22 The integration of the two businesses has been seamless, with many synergies materializing in the first six months of the 23 venture.
Production levels at the Boshoek plant have increased by over 20% since Xstrata assumed day to day operating 24 responsibility in June 2004 to an average of 650 tonnes per day and it is expected that these higher production rates will be 25 sustained into 2005.
Xstrata has an initial 89% participation in the EBITDA generated by the PSV, which decreases to 82.5% 26 over the next few years as Merafes participation increases.
Merafes shareholders include Royal Bafokeng Resources and the 27 Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa.
28 29 In January 2005, Xstrata Alloys acquired the African Carbon Group, a char producer situated in the Mpumalanga province in 30 South Africa.
The purchase extends Xstrata Alloys strategy to secure its supply of reductants, and to gain greater control over 31 key inputs into the ferrochrome manufacturing process.
Other reductant supply alternatives continue to be actively pursued.
32 33 Construction started on the 360,000 tonnes per annum first stage of Project Lion in late December 2004, following the 34 finalisation of the environmental impact study.
Initial production is expected to commence in the second half of 2006, 35 ramping up to full production in the first half of 2007.
36 37 During 2005 a feasibility study will be undertaken to evaluate retro-fitting pre-reduction pelletising technology to the 38 Wonderkop operations as part of the ongoing focus on cost reductions.
