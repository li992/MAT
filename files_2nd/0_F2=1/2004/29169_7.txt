Asset Allocation Asset Allocation We are now taking a more cautious investment stance despite the world economic recovery.
Tight energy supplies are Global Sectors threatening to push inflation higher at the same time as interest rates have begun rising.
This combination is a Geographical Regions potential threat to corporate margins and has increased risks.
When we reported our Interim results in February 2004, we Stock Selection were at that point almost fully invested: since then we have reduced our equity exposure.
Over the year, we have increased The Twenty Largest Equity liquid assets by some 10m.
We raised 17m mostly from sales in the UK and the US, where some equities looked fully valued Investments and consumption levels may be reaching their peak.
We increased asset allocation to Japan by 3.4m, the only country where we did so, following encouraging signs of a fledgling recovery.
Although risks to equity markets have increased in the short term, we still believe that ownership of well managed quality businesses should be the core of a long term investment portfolio.
We are also building expertise in direct property and fixed income investment to be ready to take advantage of those markets when we consider it advantageous.
Such moves will expand our asset class base and increase our flexibility of choice in asset allocation.
Global Sectors In 1998 we developed our global approach to managing certain sectors within the portfolio.
The rationale was to identify the most appropriate investments irrespective of domicile within those areas that operate as genuinely global industries.
This aids analysis, for example, of trends across industries worldwide FTSE World Sectors - Sterling Adjusted 31 July 2003 to 31 July 2004 120 115 Oil Oil 110 Financials 105 100 Information Technology 95 Pharmaceuticals 90 AS O N D J F M A M J J Source: Thomson Financial Datastream Investment Strategy 13 and of valuations and accounting standards on an international Stock Selection basis.

The graph on the previous detailed review of our portfolio follows on pages 14 to 25. page illustrates the performance over the past year of such sectors on a sterling-adjusted basis.
During the financial year to 31 July we reduced our exposure to The Twenty Largest % of these sectors by 12.8m.
This move reflected our more cautious Equity Investments m assets stance to equity markets in general and to certain sectors in BP 17.2 3.5 particular.
The major reductions were to healthcare, where we Shell Transport & Trading 14.8 3.0 raised 8.0m owing to our continued concern about the sector Royal Bank of Scotland 13.8 2.8 combined with corporate activity that saw bids for Amersham GlaxoSmithKline 13.4 2.7 and Celltech.
We also withdrew 2.4m from financials.
The only Vodafone 9.9 2.0 sector to receive fresh funds was technology with 1.4m being HBOS 8.5 1.7 Barclays 6.2 1.2 invested in software companies where we looked for special Alliance Trust Finance 6.1 1.2 niche growth areas and took advantage of weaker stock prices.
Aviva 5.8 1.2 HSBC 4.9 1.0 Geographical Regions Slough Estates 4.9 1.0 Diageo 4.8 1.0 Although more than half of the portfolio is covered with special Abbott Laboratories 4.5 0.9 reference to global influences, not all sectors lend themselves BHP Billiton 4.3 0.9 to this as domestic trends and influences can predominate.
An Lloyds TSB 4.3 0.9 example is the retail sector where trading and profits are Exxon Mobil 4.3 0.9 closely linked to conditions in the local economy, and where Standard Chartered 4.3 0.9 formats and styles often do not travel well across borders.
Persimmon 4.1 0.8 Tesco 4.0 0.8 We made net sales of 4.1m.
We reduced investments in the UK Microsoft 4.00.8 by 11.3m, most notably pruning back our exposure to the housing sector, food retailers, food producers and beverages.
In the US, we raised 6.6m from the general retailers, engineering, and electrical and electronic areas with small reductions in other sectors.
We invested an extra 3.4m into Japan and 2.7m into the Rest of the World, reflecting our continuing positive stance towards Asia.
Japans economy is showing more underlying strength than at any time since the early 1990s although many well-documented problems still linger.
However, price earnings multiples are now more in line internationally and this encouraged us to increase holdings in domestic sectors, both with new money and by switching from the more export-led electronics companies.
Japanese financials, because of their specific challenges, are managed wholly on a regional basis: we added to our positions, Asian Equity Markets - Sterling Adjusted and also to the commercial real estate sector, since both areas 31 July 2003 to 31 July 2004 130 began to benefit from the improving domestic economy.
We also China increased exposure to the housing and building materials 125 Japan sectors.
In Asia we reduced those holdings that were exposed 120 to the slowing Chinese economy with sales in the building and 115 auto industries and switched the proceeds into Hong Kong, 110 which is recovering from a prolonged period of deflation.
The Hong Kong 105 property sector was the major beneficiary of this switch.
