It was incorporated in the Channel Islands in 1995 and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1997 and Nasdaq in 2002.
It is a member of the FTSE 250 Index.
It has to date discovered the 7 million ounce Morila deposit in southern Mali, the 3 million ounce Tongon deposit in Cte dIvoire and added more than 7 million ounces to Loulo in western Mali, including the discovery of the Yalea orebody.
It successfully developed Morila into a world-class mine which, since it started production in October 2000, has produced 3.1 million ounces at a total cash cost of US$105 oz.
It is currently developing a second major mine at Loulo in Mali, which is scheduled to produce its first gold in July 2005 from an open-pit operation.
A development study on an underground operation, which would significantly extend Loulos size and life, is due for completion this year.
