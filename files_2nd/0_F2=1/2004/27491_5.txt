Through its Aspiration and Capital programmes it made grants worth 4.8 million for high profile arts, heritage, environment and sport organisations.
The Foundation also became a key partner in the Culture 10 initiative, a ten-year programme of high profile cultural activity focused on Newcastle Gateshead, but including other parts of the North East.
The Foundation has committed 2 million from its existing Aspiration programme to projects brought forward under the Culture 10 banner up to 2006.
In 2004 the Foundation made its third Writers Award, one of the largest literary prizes in the UK, which it runs in partnership with New Writing North.

The 2003 results have been restated to reflect a change in accounting policy following the adoption of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, resulting in an increase in staff costs and a decrease in profit of 0.2 million.
On a like-for-like basis excluding from the 2003 restated results, the 5.6 million non-recurring costs associated with the closure of certain branches, the 7.3 million surplus on the disposal of the credit card portfolio together with a 3.6 million contribution prior to its sale, and the effect on the covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation, both profit before tax and profit after tax increased by 13.0%.
Return on equity in 2004 was 21.3% compared with a restated 21.9% in 2003.
Reported earnings per share grew to 74.1p in 2004 2003 - restated 66.6p, an increase of 11.3%.

Underlying total income amounted to 730.9 million an increase of 12.0%.
On the same basis, total income as a proportion of mean total assets at 1.83% shows only a slight reduction from 1.87% for 2003.
The ratio of underlying total income to mean total assets under management at 1.25% remained unchanged compared with the first half of 2004, having eased from an underlying 1.39% in 2003.

Interest bearing assets and liabilities have been adjusted for securitised assets and non-recourse finance and interest bearing assets include equity shares and other variable yield securities.
Interest margin has been calculated by reference to average interest earning assets.
Interest spread represents the difference between interest receivable as a % of average interest earning assets and interest payable as a % of average interest bearing liabilities.
Average balances have been calculated on a monthly basis.
In 2004 interest margin and spread were 0.82% and 0.73% respectively compared with 0.85% and 0.77% in the first half of the year 2003 full year - 0.97% and 0.90%.
During the second half of 2004 spreads on lending were stable compared with the first half, consistent with the mix of lending volumes.
Throughout 2004, liability spreads were, however, adversely affected by money market rates anticipating increases in bank base rate, resulting in a net increase in our cost of funding.
The differential in rates is expected to return to more normal levels in 2005 as evidenced by the reduction in money market rates towards the end of 2004.
OPERATING EXPENSES excluding the covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation and amortisation of goodwill 2004 2003 Restated m m Staff costs 119.3 101.0 Other expenses 84.2 77.0 Depreciation 19.0 16.5 Total underlying expenses 222.5 194.5 Non-recurring costs - 5.6 Total operating expenses 222.5 200.1 Non-recurring costs in 2003 represent costs incurred in relation to the closure of certain branches.
Total operating expenses amounted to 222.5 million representing an increase of 14.4% over 2003 underlying operating expenses of 194.5 million excluding one off costs of 5.6 million relating to the closure of certain branches.
The increase of 14.4% compares with an increase in assets under management of 24.9% and total income of 12.0% on an underlying basis, resulting in a cost to assets under management ratio of 0.38% 2003 underlying - 0.41% and cost to income ratio of 30.4% 2003 underlying - 29.8%.
35 16362 N Rock ARA WEB 02 03 05 04:26 pm Page 38 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Included in 2004 operating expenses are 3.6 million incremental costs in relation to increased regulatory requirements.
Excluding these additional costs, the cost to assets under management ratio would have been 0.37% and the cost to income ratio 29.9%.
The full impact of additional regulatory costs, which will affect all UK banks, will amount to around 10.0 million for Northern Rock in 2005.
Our competitive advantage of cost efficiency remains in place as do our targets of improving our cost ratios by growing costs at less than the rate of growth of income and between one half and two thirds the growth in assets under management.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY - THE NORTHERN ROCK FOUNDATION Northern Rock donates 5% of pre-tax profit to The Northern Rock Foundation under a deed of covenant.
Such donations are used to support community and charitable causes mainly in the North East of England and Cumbria.
In addition, a 0.5 million donation is to be made by the Foundation to support the Asian tsunami aid relief.
The donation from 2004 profits amounts to 21.6 million 2003 - 19.3 million, resulting in almost 120 million having been distributed since its inception in 1997 as an integral part of Northern Rocks conversion to a plc.
PROVISIONS FOR BAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBTS The arrears position of our residential mortgage book has further improved despite the growth in mortgages under management.
At 31 December 2004 there were 2,135 2003 - 2,414 accounts three months or more in arrears representing only 0.37% 2003 - 0.45% of all mortgage accounts, less than half the UK average at 31 December 2004 of 0.80%.
The together secured advances default performance has also remained consistent, with three months plus arrears at 0.77% at 31 December 2004 2003 - 0.77%.
At 31 December 2004 181 properties, representing only 0.03% of all accounts were in possession compared with 179 0.03% at the end of 2003.
Standalone personal unsecured loan arrears are also significantly better than industry average, reflecting our policy of attracting high quality lending via our risk reward pricing.
At 31 December 2004 only 1.04% of our standalone personal unsecured loans were three months or more in arrears 2003 - 0.98% compared with an historic industry average of around 3%.
Unsecured loans within the together brand continued to perform in line with the together secured advances and better than traditional personal unsecured loans with only 0.78% three months or more in arrears 2003 - 0.80%.
Our commercial loan portfolio also continued to perform well with only 0.31% of our commercial loans three months or more in arrears 2003 - 0.53%.
The charge for provisions for bad and doubtful debts amounted to 56.5 million for the year 2003 - 48.7 million representing 0.18% of mean advances to customers 2003 - 0.19%.
The combination of high quality lending, low interest rates, low arrears and strong house price inflation have continued to contain the levels of specific provisions required for residential mortgages.
Provisions for the other secured lending portfolio have been maintained consistent with performance and expected economic conditions for this sector.
The growth in provision balances against our personal credit portfolios reflects growth in balances, the maturing nature of the portfolios and our continued prudent provisioning policy.
As a result, general provisions are 47% 2003 - 51% of total provision balances for these portfolios with total provision cover of 1.68% 2003 - 1.70%.
Total provisions against our personal credit portfolios are considered appropriate given the quality and performance of our loans.
TAXATION The tax charge for the year as a percentage of profit before tax was 29.0% 2003 - 29.0%.
We anticipate, with a corporation tax rate of 30%, that the ongoing effective tax rate will be 29.0% to 30.0% in the medium term.
% Standard corporation tax rate for 2003 30.00 Effect of net non-taxable items 0.33 Adjustment to prior year tax provisions 0.67 Effective tax rate 29.00 LENDING During 2004 Northern Rock has again achieved record levels of total lending.
Total gross lending was 23,342 million, an increase of 34.8% 2003 - 17,315 million, with total net lending of 12,932 million, an increase of 51.9% 2003 - 8,514 million.
Prospects for 2005 are good, with an opening pipeline of 5.1 billion, an increase of 31.8% 2004 opening - 3.9 billion.
The opening residential lending pipeline at 4.7 billion represents an increase of 36.6% 2004 opening - 3.4 billion.
36 16362 N Rock ARA WEB 02 03 05 04:26 pm Page 39 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued The UK residential lending market was particularly buoyant during the first half of 2004 with levels of both gross and net lending exceeding the equivalent period in 2003.
Since then both gross and net lending and net awards have slowed, following the effect of 5 one quarter per cent increases in bank base rate since November 2003.
By the end of 2004 annual house price inflation was at similar levels to that seen in 2003 although the second half of the year showed limited growth, providing clear evidence that house price inflation is slowing.
With the level of housing transactions at the lower end of long term trends and house price inflation likely to be over for the time being, new residential lending is likely to show some contraction in 2005.
Gross lending will, however, be supported by sustained levels of remortgage activity as customers seek to refinance to obtain better deals and to protect their personal budgets.
Economic conditions remain supportive to the market with low inflation, low unemployment, low interest rates and consequently good affordability.
Against this background we achieved gross residential lending of 20,051 million 2003 - 15,212 million and net residential lending of 11,383 million 2003 - 7,861 million, representing increases of 31.8% and 44.8% respectively.
Our share of gross residential lending for the year was 6.8% and our market share of net residential lending was 11.2%.
This compares with 5.8% and 8.2% respectively for the first half of 2004.
Our share of redemptions was only 4.5%, again significantly lower than our closing share of mortgage stock of 5.5%.
This was due to our pro-active customer retention process and our fair and transparent policy of allowing existing customers, subject to contractual terms, to transfer their loan to any product available to new borrowers.
The low risk profile of our new lending has continued despite strong growth in volumes.
The proportion of lending to first time buyers reduced to 21% 2003 - 23% with 79% of new customers having a proven payment track record.
The average Loan to Value ratio LTV of new lending in 2004 remained similar to 2003 at around 75% and new lending below 90% LTV was 75% 2003 - 71% of completions.
The average indexed LTV of our mortgage book is now 53% 2003 - 55% providing strong cover in the event of default.
We have minimal exposure to large loans with only around 3.5% of new loans over 500,000 and we maintained an excellent geographic spread of lending.
We offer customers a wide range of innovative and attractive products including lifestyle products and traditional price-led products.
Our lifestyle products comprise our together family of products, Lifetime Home Equity Release Mortgages HERM and residential Buy to Let mortgages.
The together products combine a secured and unsecured loan at one interest rate and one monthly payment.
Gross lending of together products amounted to 4.5 billion of which 3.8 billion were advances secured on residential property representing 20.7% of new residential lending, excluding further advances.
Outstanding balances of together mortgages remained around one fifth of our mortgage portfolio throughout 2004.
Our HERM range is aimed at homeowners aged over 60 who wish to utilise equity in their homes to enhance their lifestyle.
Such lending accounted for 1.8% of gross new residential lending 2003 - 3.4%, with outstanding HERM balances representing 3.1% 2003 - 3.0% of our year end mortgage balances.
Residential Buy to Let lending is focussed on lending to private investors secured on good quality residential properties with low LTVs.
Such lending accounted for 4.0% 2003 - 2.4% of our year end mortgage portfolio and for 6.4% 2003 - 1.7% of gross new residential lending.
This type of lending is likely to remain a niche part of our overall portfolio of lending and will be supported by demand following changes in pension legislation allowing rental properties to be included within investors pension plans.
In total, our lifestyle products, which are margin enhancing, represented 28.9% 2003 - 30.1% of our gross new residential lending and 25.3% 2003 - 25.4% of year end mortgage balances.
Of our traditional price-led mortgage products, fixed-rate mortgages remained the most popular with 46.4% 2003 - 45.5% of total new lending accounted for by short term fixed products up to two years, and 7.5% 2003 - 10.1% by longer term fixes normally up to a maximum of seven years.
This demand reflected customers preferences to obtain certainty of monthly repayments during a period of rising interest rates.
Our personal unsecured credit portfolios comprise the unsecured element of together lending and standalone unsecured loans not linked to a residential mortgage.
During 2004 gross unsecured lending amounted to 2,792 million 2003 - 1,694 million with net lending of 1,367 million 2003 - 569 million.
Gross standalone unsecured lending amounted to 2,068 million 2003 - 1,130 million with net lending of 1,104 million 2003 - 417 million.
The increase in standalone unsecured lending over 2003 reflects the deliberate containment of such lending in the first half of 2003 with a return to the market in the second half of that year.
At 31 December 2004 our unsecured lending balances were 4,669 million 2003 - 3,293 million of which 40.3% 2003 - 48.7% represented together unsecured advances.
We have continued to grow our commercial lending portfolio gradually, maintaining our emphasis on quality rather than volume of lending.
Gross lending in the year amounted to 499 million 2003 - 409 million with net lending of 182 million 2003 - 84 million.
The composition of our lending portfolios has continued to be low risk.
At the year end 88.7% of our loans under management were residential 2003 - 89.1%, 2.9% commercial secured loans 2003 - 3.3% and only 8.4% 2003 - 7.6% within our personal unsecured portfolios.
This mix is not expected to significantly change going forward.
37 16362 N Rock ARA WEB 02 03 05 04:26 pm Page 40 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued RETAIL FUNDING Total retail deposit balances for the year increased by 896 million to 17,239 million 2003 - 16,343 million, an increase of 5.5%.
This increase comprised a net inflow of retail funds for the year of 489 million plus interest credited of 407 million.
In the second half of the year we achieved a net inflow of over 1.0 billion of retail funds, following a net outflow of 163 million in the first half, representing our best ever half year performance and clearly demonstrating the strength and diversity of our retail franchise.
The funding during the year was largely into our Silver Savings account launched in September 2004 for the over 50s which had attracted balances of over 1,250 million by the year end.
Fixed rate bonds also remained popular.
Balances in our Ireland based operation rose by 18.3% to 628 million, with 1,871 million 2003 - 1,875 million in our Guernsey based off-shore vehicle.
NON-RETAIL FUNDING Total net non-retail funding for the year amounted to 2,770 million with balances at 31 December 2004 amounting to 19,746 million 2003 - 16,976 million.
Our non-retail funding provides a balanced mixture of short and medium term funding with increasing diversification of our global investor base.
During 2004 we raised 3.4 billion medium term, wholesale funds from a variety of sources located globally, with specific emphasis on the US and Europe.
A major feature was the increased utilisation of our US Medium Term Note programme from which we raised US$3.7 billion in both senior and subordinated form.
Already in 2005 we have raised a further US$1.75 billion under this programme and in the remainder of the year plan to raise further non-retail funds, including possible issuances in Asia.
With regards to short term funding, key developments include the establishment of a 2.0 billion French Certificate of Deposit programme which provides access to domestic French investors.
This programme had outstanding balances of 1.1 billion at the year end.
Further diversification will be achieved in the current year with the intended establishment of a Canadian Commercial Paper programme.
SECURITISATION Funding through securitisation has remained an integral part of Northern Rocks funding strategy.
During 2004 three issues were completed raising 11.1 billion.
Diversification of our investor base continued with over 70% of the securitised bonds in 2004 being issued in US dollars or euros.
The characteristics of the mortgages securitised, in terms of product type, LTV and geographic distribution remain similar to those of our on-balance sheet mortgages, ensuring that we are maintaining the quality of our balance sheet.
At 31 December 2004 assets under management subject to securitisation amounted to 22.3 billion 2003 - 15.7 billion, representing 40% 2003 - 36% of our total lending portfolios.
In 2005 we have already raised a very well received 4.5 billion securitisation of residential mortgages.
Our programmes will continue to be developed with further issues during 2005.
COVERED BOND In the first half of 2004 we raised 2.0 billion from an inaugural covered bond issue from a newly established 10 billion programme.
The covered bond is secured by a pool of ring-fenced residential mortgages which remain on-balance sheet as Northern Rock retains substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the loans.
DIVIDENDS The interim dividend paid in October 2004 was 8.5p per share.
The proposed final dividend of 18.0p per share is payable on 27 May 2005 to shareholders on the register on 29 April 2005.
This results in a total dividend payable for the year of 26.5p per share 2003 - 23.3p, an increase of 13.7%.
CAPITAL At 31 December 2004 total capital amounted to 3,239 million resulting in a total capital ratio of 14.0%, comfortably above regulatory and internal requirements.
Tier 1 capital was 2,015 million and the Tier 1 ratio 8.7%.
The comparable ratios at 31 December 2003 were 14.3% and 9.0% respectively.
In the first half of 2004 we raised $700 million 396 million equivalent of Upper Tier 2 capital via our US Medium Term Note programme delivering an excellent diversification of capital from the US domestic market.
During 2004 we continued to embed our Basel II credit risk systems within our normal operational activities and remain on target to adopt the Retail Internal Ratings Based approach currently anticipated to commence on 1 January 2007.
Significant investment is also being made in our Operational Risk management systems and in line with the FSAs expectations for the sector we intend to initially adopt the Standardised Approach to Operational Risk.
We will closely examine the consultation paper from the FSA, issued at the end of January 2005, with a view to seeking approval for our proposed approaches as early as possible.
Our low risk balance sheet means that we expect to achieve significant reductions to the levels of our total regulatory risk weighted assets for credit exposures compared to current levels.
This should result in future capital efficiencies subject to consultation with the FSA and credit rating agencies.

In certain areas these standards represent a significant change from UK GAAP.
A number of uncertainties currently exist concerning the adoption of the new standards and their impact on Northern Rock.
In particular, the approach of the Financial Services Authority towards IFRS was outlined in Consultation Paper 04 17.
The discussion period for this Consultation Paper ended on 31 January 2005.
In addition, the tax treatment of certain aspects of IFRS has not yet been fully determined by the Inland Revenue and the effect of these uncertainties is under review.
The combination may affect both the tax charge and our accounting and regulatory equity ratios.
IFRS includes a number of areas, principally financial instruments, where fair values are required to a far greater extent than under UK GAAP.
This will create greater volatility in reported results and have an associated impact on other financial measures.
However, the change to IFRS does not alter the cash flows of the business, but spreads the profitability throughout the life of the loan.
The change to IFRS will not change the way Northern Rock does business.
39 16362 N Rock ARA WEB 02 03 05 04:26 pm Page 42 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued The key changes and their anticipated effect on Northern Rock are set out below.
Issue Effect on financial statements Hedge accounting Northern Rock manages the financial risks arising from its business using a number of To the extent that hedge effectiveness is derivatives instruments such as interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate not achieved for derivatives, the movements agreements, interest rate and bond futures, currency swaps and forward exchange in fair value of the derivatives would impact contracts.
IAS 39 requires derivatives to be recognised at fair value, with changes in on the profit and loss account increasing valuation impacting the profit and loss account, potentially resulting in significant volatility in earnings.
Hedge accounting permissibility is much more restricted under IAS 39 than at present under UK GAAP.
Northern Rock has reviewed its underlying processes to ensure it maximises the natural offsets between assets and liabilities and designs compliant hedging strategies wherever possible for the remainder.
However, the overriding objective continues to be to provide an economic hedge for the market risks arising from its underlying business.

OUTLOOK The home moving market is expected to continue to remain at similar levels to 2004, at the lower end of longer term trends, for at least the next two years.
Many first time buyers will continue to be excluded from the market as a result of higher house prices, the competition with Buy to Let investors for traditional first time buyer properties, especially in urban areas, and higher levels of indebtedness linked to the funding of higher education.
In conjunction with subdued levels of house moving transactions we expect to see muted house price inflation with some price falls in areas that have seen excessive growth.
We expect, however, given low unemployment, low interest rates and good affordability, house prices to be growing in line with average earnings by the end of 2005.
The UKs gross residential mortgage market, supported by remortgage activity, is anticipated to be 265 billion to 270 billion in 2005 and 2006 compared with over 290 billion in 2004.
Such levels of gross lending remain conducive to Northern Rock achieving its lending targets for 2005.
A slower housing market, reduced inflationary pressures and a dampening in retail sales mean that the prospects for rising interest rates are significantly lower than in mid 2004, as a consequence the difference between LIBOR and Bank Base Rate is expected to return to more normal levels in 2005.
Unemployment, the key driver of credit loss on home loans, looks set to remain benign giving a stable outlook for future provisioning levels.
These conditions, together with our continued focus on customer service, cost and capital efficiency and the strength of our opening pipeline enable us to view 2005 with confidence.
We reaffirm our strategic targets of assets under management growth of 20% 5%, profit growth of 15% 5% and return on equity of 19% to 22%.
Our growth will continue to be supported by our four funding arms: retail, non-retail, securitisation and covered bonds.
We intend to develop further each franchise in terms of flexibility and diversification to enhance our overall funding platform and investor base.
We remain confident of the continued success of the Northern Rock business model.
