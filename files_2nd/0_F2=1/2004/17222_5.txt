The record date for the final dividend is 23 April 2004. Dividend policy The directors believe that results achieved from investment in new stores and the refurbishment of older premises continue to outweigh perceived benets from excessive increases in dividend.
Reasonable annual increases in dividend per share have been and will be made when considered prudent.
Employment policies The groups comprehensive employment policies cover recruitment, selection, retention, pay and benets, learning and development and equality.
Employee involvement It is the groups policy that employees should be kept as fully informed as possible about the activities of the group.

The group recognises two trade unions and has a partnership agreement with the majority trade union.
We maintain positive working relationships with the unions at local and national level.

Disability The group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by people with disabilities.
Where an employee becomes disabled whilst in employment, every effort will be made to look at appropriate and reasonable adjustments and to offer suitable employment together with assistance with retraining.
Auditors In accordance with Sections 385 and 390A of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and to authorise the directors to x their remuneration is to be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Borrowing powers The articles of association of the company restrict the borrowings of the company and its subsidiary undertakings to a maximum amount equal to twice the share capital and consolidated reserves.
Annual general meeting Seven ordinary and two special resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Details of these resolutions are set out in the notice of meeting on pages 4 and 5 of this report.
The directors believe each of these resolutions is in the best interests of the company and recommend shareholders to vote in favour of all of them as they intend to do in respect of their personal beneficial holdings of 110,641,616 ordinary shares of the company.
8 Wm MORRISON SUPERMARKETS PLC Directors report continued Share capital The following resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting: 1 Resolution 7 a special resolution to renew until the close of the next annual general meeting the authority given at the annual general meeting held on 22 May 2003 for the company to buy its ordinary and convertible preference shares on the London Stock Exchange up to a maximum of 151,900,000 ordinary shares of 10p 1 each ordinary shares and 144,476 5 4% cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares of 1 each convertible preference shares representing approximately 57% and 10% respectively of the issued share capital in each class of shares.
2 Resolutions 8 an ordinary resolution and 9 a special resolution to enable directors to continue to exercise existing powers to allot unissued shares and to allot shares for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings.
These resolutions replace the resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting of the company held on 11 February 2004 and will run until the close of the next annual general meeting.
The intention is to renew and roll them forward by one year at each future annual general meeting.
Under resolution 8 the directors will be authorised to allot the unissued ordinary share capital of the company representing approximately 302% of the issued ordinary share capital.
Resolution 9 authorises the directors to allot equity shares for cash otherwise than pro rata to ordinary shareholders.
They may do so only in respect of shares representing up to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital, in connection with the conversion of the convertible preference shares or to facilitate rights issues of ordinary shares.
Save for the issues of shares in relation to share option schemes or on conversion of the convertible preference shares, there is no present intention to make use of either authority and the resolutions are being proposed only to ensure that the directors are able to act in the best interests of the company should a requirement arise.
Any shares purchased pursuant to the authority contained in resolution 7 will be cancelled or held in treasury.
Regulations introduced in 2003 enable listed companies to hold their own shares, once purchased, in treasury, as an alternative to cancelling them.
Shares held in treasury may be cancelled, sold for cash or used to satisfy share options and share awards under employee share schemes.
The company is not entitled to exercise any rights, including the right to attend and vote at meetings in respect of the shares and no dividend or other distribution may be made in respect of the shares.
It may be appropriate for the company to hold its own ordinary shares in treasury, rather than cancelling them if the directors exercise the authority conferred by resolution 7.
Your board will have regard to any guidelines which may be published by investor groups in considering any purchase, holding or resale of treasury shares.
The approval of the holders of the convertible preference shares to the purchases of shares pursuant to the authority contained in resolution 7, and any renewal of further grant of that authority on like terms, was given at a separate meeting held on 13 May 1999.
Under the provisions of the companys articles of association, the holders of convertible preference shares in the company have the right to convert such shares during June in each year up to 2006 into ordinary shares.
The convertible preference shareholders will shortly receive a letter regarding their rights of conversion in 2004.
During the period, a total of 3,257,587 convertible preference shares were converted into 10,945,492 ordinary shares on the basis of 336 ordinary shares for every 100 nominal amount of convertible preference shares in accordance with the terms of issue of the convertible preference shares.
In addition, 1,197,298 ordinary shares were issued to employees exercising share options.
In the period 2 February 2004 to 18 March 2004 options in respect of 91,721 ordinary shares were exercised.
On 8 March 2004 1,077,053,733 ordinary shares were issued on the acquisition of Safeway plc becoming effective.

This authority remained valid on 1 February 2004.
The company has not purchased any of its own shares pursuant to that authority which will expire at the close of the 2004 annual general meeting.
At 18 March 2004 options in respect of 53,872,586 ordinary shares of 10p each in the company were outstanding, representing 20% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date and 22% of the issued ordinary share capital assuming exercise in full by the company of its authority both current and that being sought at the annual general meeting to purchase its own shares.
At the extraordinary general meeting held on 11 February 2004 the shareholders passed resolutions to increase the authorised share capital by 200,000,000 and to authorise the directors to allot unissued shares and to do so for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings.
The authorities relating to the allotment of shares will be replaced by those proposed at the annual general meeting.

An exercise will take place over the coming months to establish the fair value of the assets acquired.
Further details of current and future developments are set out in the chairmans statement on pages 6 and 7.
Going concern After making enquiries the directors have a reasonable belief that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Payment to creditors Supplier credit is an important factor in the success of the business.
Following the acquisition of Safeway plc we will, as previously acknowledged, work within the spirit and letter of the supermarkets code of practice.

Health and Safety Policy It is the groups intention as far as is reasonably practical to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all its employees, customers and visitors to its premises.
In order to achieve this, the group has drawn up a comprehensive health and safety manual that contains policies and procedures detailing safe working systems and practices for all work-based activities.
The groups health and safety policy is fully mandated by the main board of directors.
As an integral part of our commitment to achieving the highest standards of health and safety across all areas of our business we have adopted the national targets set by the Health and Safety Commission for the reduction of workplace accidents and work-related ill health.
Health and safety performance is monitored to ensure continuous improvement in all areas.

Corporate governance Statement of policy The directors statement on how the principles established in the combined code on corporate governance are applied to the company appears below.
The directors represent shareholders interests in maintaining and growing a successful business including optimising long-term returns.
The directors are accountable for determining that the company and its subsidiaries are managed in such a way as to achieve this objective.
The board, in addition to meeting its obligations for improving shareholder value, has a responsibility to the companys customers, employees and suppliers, and to the communities where it develops and invests.
All these principles and responsibilities are founded upon the basis of maintaining the successful continuity of the business.
Guidelines on corporate governance issues Directors The board is made up entirely of executive directors.
The board keeps under review the question of appointing non executive directors.
The board is free to make the selection of chairman and chief executive in the best interests of the company at the relevant time and has an open mind whether or not the roles should be separate.
12 Wm MORRISON SUPERMARKETS PLC Directors report continued The board is responsible for the appointment of directors and for nominating them for election by the shareholders on first appointment and thereafter at three yearly intervals.
The directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary who is responsible for ensuring that applicable rules and regulations are applied with.
They may also take independent professional advice, if required in the furtherance of their duties, at the companys expense.
Relations with shareholders The company maintains regular contact with institutional shareholders throughout the year.
The board prefers to see such shareholders in the presence of a broker to broaden the access of shareholders to the discussions at such meetings.
In addition the annual general meeting provides a forum for communicating with private investors.
Internal control The board is responsible for the groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The combined code has a requirement that the directors review the effectiveness of the groups system of internal controls.
This includes internal financial controls and controls over financial, operational, compliance, and risk management.
The board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group, that has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts, and that this process is regularly reviewed by the board and accords with the guidance.
During 2003 the board met in full on over 20 occasions.
Matters regularly covered included reports from each of the main sectors of the business Store Operations, Trading, Estates & Property, Personnel, Information Technology, Finance and Legal as well as other business as it arose.
Regular operations meetings are held involving members of the main board, members of the board of management and other specialists as required.
In addition the property director discusses all relevant matters with the chairman and his managing director on a regular basis.
Subsidiary company board meetings are held each month and attended by at least one member of the group main board.
Detailed operational meetings are held by each member of the board with their relevant managers.
The directors are satisfied that these procedures are adequate to minimise potential risks facing the business.
The company does not have an independent internal audit department capable of performing a full and regular monitoring role of the companys procedures.
Despite this it is felt that the financial record keeping is robust and capable of highlighting significant departures from procedures.
Other areas of risk which may normally be carried out by an internal audit department are in the main covered by the board either as a whole or within the various meetings highlighted above.
The security department regularly audits and reports on the robustness of internal procedures and their implementation and is also closely involved in all matters of a sensitive nature reporting directly to the chairman.
Consequently the directors have confirmed that they do not feel it necessary to expand the internal audit department at this stage.
Compliance statement The company is required to report on compliance with the detailed requirements of the combined code throughout the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2004.
In relation to all provisions of the combined code other than those mentioned below, the company complied throughout the period under review.
References are to paragraphs of the combined code.
The company ensures that it recruits to the board only individuals of sufficient calibre, knowledge and experience to full the duties of a director appropriately.
There is no formal training programme for directors A.
The company does not have any non-executive directors on the board A.
The directors are mindful of the provisions of the combined code in this regard and regularly review the situation.
The companys nomination committee is made up of the chairman and managing directors.
There are no non-executive members on the committee A.
The company does not have a formal remuneration committee B.
2.1-6, C. 2.3 but the emoluments of the directors are the subject of appraisal by the chairman and the managing directors taking into account individual performance and market conditions.
The company complies with the requirements set out in the Companies Act for giving notice of annual general meetings.
Whilst mindful of the requirement of the code to give shareholders at least 20 working days notice this may not be strictly adhered to C. 2.4.
The company does not have an audit committee C. 2.3, D. 3.1, D. 3.2 but the board as a whole regularly monitors internal controls and also ensures that an objective and professional relationship is maintained with the auditors.
