Later in the year, it divested its interests in the Zinkgruvan and Neves Corvo mines for a net consideration of US$193 million which included a profit sharing adjustment and the sale of the rights to future price participation on the Neves Corvo sale.
Sale of the Fortaleza nickel complex in Brazil was completed in early 2004 for total cash consideration of about US$80 million.
The sale of Rio Tintos 51 per cent interest in Rio Paracatu Minerao for US$250 million was completed at the end of the year.
