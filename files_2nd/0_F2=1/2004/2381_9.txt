Making the right choices The point of excellence Our upstream and downstream activities reach not only the marketplace but also investors, regulators, government leaders and the public.
Our abilities as an organization to sustain and improve our standing among these groups are key to our definition of operational excellence.
These abilities support our new scope and scale while retaining the diverse heritage of our people and businesses.
They help equip BP with the skills, knowledge and reputation that enable us to conduct business in a chosen country and let us navigate an increasingly complex and unpredictable world with sensitivity.
22 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Our human potential In business in general, and within BP in particular, the relationship between employee and performance is unbreakable.
Simply put, our employees hold the knowledge, skills and energy that enable our enterprise to thrive.
At BP, operational excellence includes the ways in which we expand our employees range of possibilities as they expand ours.
A good example is our Projects Academy.
In 2003, we began working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT to change how our teams deliver major projects.
Focusing on project leadership, business knowledge and technical excellence, the MIT programme is bringing BPs senior project leaders together with recognized leaders in engineering and project management.
The first two Projects Academy classes graduated in 2004.
Their members are already applying new insights to manage the complexity of their projects, understand team dynamics, clarify priorities and build a well-connected network of ideas.
The Projects Academy, Marketing Academy and other practical initiatives give BP the capacity to learn and share knowledge on an everyday, global basis, and to grow our most prized resource our people.
