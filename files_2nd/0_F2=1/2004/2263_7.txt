GROUP PROFILE Introduction The BOC Group began its business life over 100 years ago as the Brins Oxygen Company.
The company was incorporated in England in 1886 and adopted its present name on 1 March 1982.
A technology to extract oxygen from the air in commercial quantities had just been developed and in 1886 the Brin brothers started production at a factory in Westminster, London.
Two uses had already been found for oxygen.
One was to intensify limelight, which was then used in theatres.
The other was to assist patients breathing during and after surgery.
New technology was soon developed that allowed air to be separated into all its major components - nitrogen, oxygen and argon.
By 1960, industrial gases were in widespread use and BOCs business was firmly established.
Tonnage plants were supplying steelworks with oxygen and the customer base had been broadened to extend from metal cutting and welding to food and medicine.
The business had also spread overseas with subsidiaries or associated companies as far away as Australia and South Africa.
During the 1980s, BOCs South African subsidiary began to invest in private hospitals.
This diversification was the basis of the current Afrox hospitals segment.
BOC acquired the vacuum equipment company Edwards High Vacuum International Limited in 1968 and this formed the basis of what was to become the BOC Edwards line of business today.
The BOC Distribution Services business now called Gist was first established in 1970, initially providing a chilled food distribution service for Marks & Spencer and relying upon distribution skills and liquid nitrogen chilling technology, acquired as a result of BOCs involvement in gases.
In 1978, BOC completed the acquisition of Airco Inc in America, a predominantly gases business that doubled the Groups size and brought BOC for the first time into the US gases market.
In the period from 1970 to 1990 The BOC Group significantly increased its presence in the Asia Pacific region through participation in several joint ventures or associated companies.
BOC established strong market positions in Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines, China and Korea.
An investment in 1982 gave BOC effective management control of the Japanese gases company Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK OSK.
Conversion of loan stock and subsequent purchases of shares raised BOCs holding in OSK to 97 per cent.
In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide announced a conditional agreement to merge their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan.
The merger became effective in January 2003 and BOCs subsidiary in Japan has retained a 45 per cent interest in the joint venture company called Japan Air Gases Ltd.
In the period from 1998 to 2001, BOC increased investments in its gases companies in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines by acquiring the interests of joint venture partners or minority shareholders.
The BOC Group has an international portfolio of companies operating as three lines of business.
These are Process Gas Solutions PGS, Industrial and Special Products ISP and BOC Edwards.
In addition there are two separately managed specialist businesses, Afrox hospitals and Gist.
Operating results are reported separately for these five segments.
The main exports of the Group in 2004 were special products from the UK, helium from the US and vacuum equipment and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the UK, the US and Japan.
Trade between Group undertakings is conducted at fair market prices.
Although BOC Process Plants was combined with Linde Engineering in the US with effect from September 2002, BOC retains an interest in the manufacture of industrial gas equipment though its Cryostar business based in France.
Cryostar makes specialist cryogenic pumps and expansion turbines that are used by most manufacturers of industrial gas plant.
In recent years Cryostar has also developed a strong position in the market for shipboard compressors and heat exchangers used aboard liquefied natural gas LNG tankers.
Management believes that Cryostar is the leading manufacturer of its product range worldwide.

The largest Group subsidiary in Africa is African Oxygen Limited Afrox, a South African public company in which the Group owns 56 per cent of the equity.
The largest shareholder, other than BOC, holds less than 15 per cent of the equity.
Afrox, primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products within the PGS and ISP lines of business.
Afrox also has interests in private hospitals, clinics and other health care services in southern Africa, primarily through its 69 per cent holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited.
There are other Group or Afrox subsidiary companies in Africa located in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
These companies are engaged primarily in the manufacture and or sale of products in the ISP line of business.
BOC has businesses in most of the Asia Pacific markets, including Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, China, the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia and New Zealand.
In Australia, the Groups business is conducted by BOC Limited.
This company, as well as its subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in the PGS and ISP lines of business.
BOC participates in the liquefied petroleum gas market in Australia through a 50 per cent shareholding in Elgas Limited.
Elsewhere in the Pacific region, the Group conducts its business through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies.
Management organisation BOCs management structure is based on three global lines of business and two specialist businesses.
Each line of business serves a clearly defined type of customer and each pursues its own strategy for growth and performance at a local level.
The organisation is designed to maximise BOCs global as well as local strengths.
The lines of business have global responsibility to set strategy and prioritise investment.
They include operational business units and these local units are responsible to the Group chief executive for delivering financial, safety and operational performance.
The business units contribute to the development of the strategies of the lines of business and customise and implement them in local markets.
The business unit heads collaborate in order to share best practice and to maximise growth and profit opportunities wherever they may appear.
Process Gas Solutions PGS manages all aspects of BOCs business with customers requiring bulk supplies of industrial gases from on-site plants or by pipeline as well as deliveries of liquefied gases.
Typical customers are found in the oil and chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors all round the world.
Marketing, business development and the execution of investments to provide customer specific solutions for the supply of industrial gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS.
Until 2002, Process Plants, another unit forming part of PGS, was responsible for supplying air separation technology within the Group with plants of its own design or acquired from alliance partners and others.
In March 2002 BOC announced plans to merge its Process Plants operations with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC.
The transaction was completed just before the end of 2002.
BOC owns 30 per cent of the combined company and Linde Engineering has become the principal supplier of industrial gases plant to BOC worldwide.
Industrial and Special Products ISP covers BOCs business with customers in the fabrication, medical and leisure sectors as well as the special products and liquefied petroleum gases businesses.
BOC Edwards embraces all aspects of business with semiconductor industry customers worldwide including the supply of bulk gases and electronic materials, vacuum and abatement technology, chemical management systems and  services.
BOC Edwards also serves general vacuum markets around the world and manufactures pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging machinery.
15 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Group profile The segment reporting as Afrox hospitals operates through Afrox Healthcare Limited, which is quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
It owns and manages private hospitals and clinics in southern Africa.
Additional services include a direct medicines service for chronic medication, occupational health services, nursing training, pharmacy management and laboratory services.
BOCs majority-owned subsidiary, African Oxygen Limited Afrox, holds 69 per cent of Afrox Healthcare Limited AHealth.
In July 2003 Afrox announced that it was in the process of considering its strategic options with regard to its shareholding in AHealth.
On 17 November 2003, Afrox announced that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in AHealth to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment investors.
The sale remains subject to approval by the South African Competition Tribunal, at which closing hearings are currently scheduled for March 2005.
In addition an application has been brought in the South African High Court by two shareholders in Afrox Healthcare Limited to have the Scheme of Arrangement, by which the disposal would be implemented, declared to have lapsed.
This application, which is being opposed, is currently due to be heard in the week commencing 29 November 2004.
During 2001, BOC Distribution Services was re-named Gist to reflect the changing nature of its business.
Gist operates as a separate business unit outside the lines of business structure.
It remains focused on developing business with major customers, including Marks & Spencer, and has developed capability in supply chain consultancy and end-to-end supply chain solutions.
Corporate development Over the last three years BOC has continued to invest in its core businesses at the same time as divesting assets and businesses that were no longer consistent with its strategy.
As a result of a successful tender offer, BOC increased its shareholding in Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK OSK in Japan from approximately 55 per cent to over 93 per cent with effect from 8 May 2001.
The holding was further increased during 2002 to 97 per cent.
The merger became effective in January 2003 and BOCs subsidiary in Japan has retained a 45 per cent interest in the combined company called Japan Air Gases Ltd.
In June 2001, BOC increased its holding in Thai Industrial Gases Public Company Limited TIG from approximately 60 per cent to over 90 per cent and launched a tender offer for the outstanding shares leading to 99 per cent ownership.
In October 2001 BOC Edwards agreed terms for the acquisition of the vacuum and pressure business of the Smiths Group.
These businesses are located in the UK, north America and continental Europe and typically serve customers in the metallurgy, water treatment, food, power and chemical industries.
Hydromatix and Semco were also acquired during 2002 with the intention of positioning BOC Edwards in those market segments expected to deliver the fastest growth.
These two companies, based in the US, are involved principally in semiconductor wet processing technology including chemical blending delivery and collection systems as well as liquid waste abatement systems.
BOC Edwards sold its glass coating business, based in the US, in April 2002 but retained its Temescal business that supplies technology for compound semiconductor manufacturing.
The acquisition of the turbomolecular pumps business from Seiko Instruments Inc in Japan was announced in February 2002 and completed in March 2002 with the principal objective of enhancing the ability of BOC Edwards to develop vacuum sub-systems to satisfy the growing trend to on-tool pumping in the semiconductor industry.
In April 2002 BOC purchased Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, thereby adding an important special products capability to BOCs Industrial and Special Products range in Canada.
In May 2002 BOC acquired Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited UGP, in Thailand.
UGP is a leading supplier of liquefied petroleum gas LPG and packaged ammonia in the industrial and special products markets.
The transaction was completed at the end of September 2002.
BOCs associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc NIOI in March 2002 and increased its holding to 100 per cent in September 2002 following a tender offer.
Each of BOCs three lines of business has absorbed a part of NIOI.
At the end of August 2002, BOC announced an agreement to purchase Praxairs Polish gases business.
The transaction was completed at the end of January 2003 following approval by the Polish competition authority.
The business acquired includes a high proportion of industrial and special products sales.
In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation EMC, a privately owned water services company based in St Louis, Missouri.
EMC manages water and wastewater treatment facilities for both industrial and local municipal customers around the US.
EMC forms part of the PGS line of business, which intends to expand the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, Texas, from Celanese.
Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake.
In March 2003 BOC announced an agreement to purchase the Canadian packaged gas and related welding equipment business of Air Products.
The acquisition was completed in April 2003 following approval from the Canadian regulatory authority.
16 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Group profile In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output of a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar.
Deliveries from the new source are scheduled to commence in July 2005.
Following a strategic review of its investment, African Oxygen Limited Afrox announced on 17 November 2003 that it had agreed to sell its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment investors in South Africa.
On 27 January 2004, BOC announced that it intended to dispose of part of its US Industrial and Special Products business to Airgas Inc.
The transaction was completed on 30 July 2004.
The initial consideration was US$175 million in cash with up to a further US$25 million to be paid on or about 15 November 2005 subject to certain conditions.
In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energys 30 per cent ownership interest in the Cantarell joint venture company for US$59.7 million in cash.
This increased BOCs overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in September 2004.
This company supplies Pemex with nitrogen for the pressurisation of its oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico.
Industrial gases The BOC Group is one of the major producers of industrial gases in the world.
Its products include the atmospheric gases nitrogen, oxygen and argon produced by air separation plants as well as hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide made by technologies including steamreforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbons.
The Group also markets carbon dioxide, helium and liquefied petroleum gas.
These are generally derived as by-products from chemical processes or from natural sources and are also purchased from other producers.
In addition, the Group markets dissolved acetylene and a wide range of special gases, medical gases, gas mixtures and gaseous chemicals.
Industry structure and consolidation The industrial gases business is capital-intensive, with increasing demand, together with economies of scale, leading to the need for large production units and distribution networks.
The need for fixed asset investments, the trend towards global customers and the benefits from the transfer of applications technology worldwide have resulted in the business being handled by a relatively small number of companies internationally.
One or more other major international producers compete in each of the industrial gases markets served by the Group, and in many of the markets there are smaller local producers as well.
International competitors include Air Liquide, Praxair, Air Products and Chemicals, Linde, Airgas and Nippon Sanso.
The world market for gases and related products is estimated to be over 20 billion a year.
On 13 July 1999 the board of The BOC Group agreed the terms of a pre-conditional cash offer at 14.60 per share to be made jointly by Air Liquide and Air Products.
Making the offer was conditional upon those companies obtaining satisfactory regulatory clearances in Europe, Canada and the US by 13 March 2000.
Following an extension to the pre-conditional offer period to conclude discussions with the Federal Trade Commission FTC in the US, the bidders allowed the offer to lapse on 10 May 2000.
Principal industrial gas products Nitrogen possesses two key characteristics that make it the worlds most widely used and versatile industrial gas.
Nitrogen is almost inert and when liquefied it is intensely cold.
This makes liquid nitrogen a highly effective, versatile and non-polluting agent for freezing and chilling.
Under normal conditions nitrogen is chemically inactive.
This makes it an important purging and blanketing gas in the chemical and refining industry as well as in the electronics industry.
Oxygen, in contrast to nitrogen, is useful for its reactivity.
It supports combustion and it supports life.
Oxygen has been used in welding and medicine for over 100 years and in steel production since the 1950s.
Iron and steel producers use oxygen to accelerate melting and to improve metal quality during the refining process.
It is also used by the oil and chemicals industries and many others for a variety of oxidation processes.
Mixed with fuel gases, oxygen provides a heat source for many welding, cutting and metal fabrication processes.
Argon makes up less than one per cent of the atmosphere but it is the most abundant truly inert gas.
It is used to provide a shielding atmosphere in welding, metal fabrication, aluminium processing, microelectronics, glass coating, advanced ceramics and other industrial processes.
It is also used in the steel industry, principally in the production of stainless steel.
Hydrogen is typically produced by steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas, petroleum gas, or liquid or solid hydrocarbon feedstocks.
Hydrogen may also be recovered from by-products purchased by BOC from external suppliers.
Hydrogen is used primarily in the oil and chemicals industries for applications aimed at upgrading crude oil through hydrocracking to form lighter fractions and to remove sulphur in the production of cleaner fuels.
The chemicals industry also uses hydrogen where it is required as an active ingredient in many largescale processes.
Helium is extracted from natural gas deposits.
Only a few sources in the world contain a sufficient proportion of helium to justify its separation.
The Groups supplies now come from the US, Poland and Russia and are secured by long-term contracts.
In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar.
Deliveries from this new source are expected to begin in July 2005.
Because of its high value, helium is the only major industrial gas to be extensively traded internationally.
Helium is used in welding, leak detection, hospital MRI scanners and in the production of optical fibres.
Helium gas mixtures are used in balloons.
17 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Group profile Carbon dioxide supplied by BOC is obtained as a by-product from other companies manufacturing processes, from natural sources or recovered in the generation process for hydrogen or syngas and put to constructive use.
Solid carbon dioxide is, like liquid nitrogen, used for chilling and freezing in the food industry.
As a gas it is used to carbonate and dispense beverages of all kinds.
Acetylene is normally supplied in cylinders and used together with oxygen in metal cutting and welding applications.
BOC is a major manufacturer of dissolved acetylene.
Liquefied petroleum gas LPG is a fuel gas with a wide variety of domestic, industrial and transport applications.
BOC is a major distributor of LPG in South Africa and Thailand, and its joint venture company Elgas Limited is a major distributor in Australia.
BOC has smaller market positions in several other countries.
Production of industrial gases Oxygen was first extracted from the atmosphere by a chemical process.
This was superseded over 80 years ago by the cryogenic low temperature process involving the liquefaction and distillation of air.
The cryogenic process is still by far the most widely used, but non-cryogenic techniques pressure swing adsorption and membrane diffusion, which were first developed during the 1970s, are becoming increasingly significant for smaller or less demanding on-site applications.
Cryogenic air separation is a mature and stable technology, although incremental technical advances are still yielding improvements in capital cost, operating cost, ease of operation and reliability.
The only significant raw material, apart from the air itself, is electricity, which is used in large quantities to drive compressors, pumps and other equipment.
The production process in modern air separation plants is highly automated, and remote operation of BOCs plants from control centres is becoming increasingly common.
The production of hydrogen and syngas uses steam reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbon feedstocks such as natural gas, petroleum or coal to separate the hydrogen and carbon compounds.
The choice of feedstock is related to their prices in local markets.
Distribution of industrial gases Industrial gases may be supplied to customers in a variety of ways: through pipelines from on-site or nearby cryogenic or non-cryogenic plants, by deliveries of liquefied gases in road or rail tankers, in portable cryogenic containers or in cylinders also called compressed or packaged gases.
Distribution is an important competitive factor in the industrial gases business and the methods of distribution vary according to the nature of the products themselves and the customers volume requirements.
Most gases have to be stored and distributed either under great pressure, which requires them to be carried in heavy and bulky cylinders, or at extremely low temperatures in specially insulated tankers, which limits how far they can be transported before carriage costs become unacceptable.
Pipeline delivery involves high capital costs and the routing is inflexible.
As a result, there is little international trade in industrial gases.
Production has to occur in or near the market being served and there is a trend towards production at customers own sites.
Business segments The BOC Group reports financial results for the three lines of business and for Afrox hospitals and Gist separately.
Process Gas Solutions PGS This line of business covers BOCs business with larger-scale industrial customers worldwide, typically in the oil and chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors.
Gases and services are supplied as part of customerspecific solutions that create the most value for customers at the lowest cost to BOC.
These range from supply by pipeline or from dedicated on-site plants to the largest users, to supply by road tanker in liquefied form to others.
Tonnage pipeline customers are usually supplied on the basis of long-term contracts, typically containing a fixed facility charge together with a variable charge for product supplied in excess of a set minimum quantity.
Revenues from these contracts thus have a measure of stability with respect to changes in demand for product.
Tonnage plants are often built to produce merchant gases in addition to those required by the tonnage customer and these gases can be sold to other customers.
The BOC Group has substantial positions in the tonnage markets of the UK, the US, Australia, South Africa and Asia as well as in some smaller markets.
The products supplied to tonnage customers have traditionally been the atmospheric gases oxygen, nitrogen and argon.
More recently, hydrogen and syngas are becoming significant tonnage products as are associated utilities including steam and power.
The delivery of liquefied gases by road or rail to the customers site is normally limited by transport costs to a radius of about 200 miles.
Product for this market is supplied either from merchant plants or from tonnage plants incorporating liquefiers.
Larger users are typically supplied with product in liquid form delivered in cryogenic tankers into special storage vessels installed at customer premises.
Tankers and vessels are often BOC Group owned.
Liquefied gases are usually supplied on the basis of contracts with terms of one to five years.
Revenues are generally based upon the actual quantity of gas consumed, with an additional fixed charge for the use of storage equipment.
The growth of sales and profit in this line of business is driven by investment in new production facilities.
Such investment is predominantly the result of opportunities to satisfy long-term supply contracts with one or more heavy industrial customers for each plant.
Marketing, business development and the execution of investments to provide customer-specific solutions for the supply of industrial gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS.
18 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Group profile Business development A plant to supply OneSteel at Whyalla in South Australia was commissioned in November 2001 also replacing and increasing capacity over previous and less efficient merchant plants in Adelaide.
Shortly afterwards in January 2002 a new plant began supplying Huntsman on Teesside in the UK with hydrogen to be used for the production of aniline.
In April 2002, BOC established a joint venture in Nanjing with Yangtze Petrochemical Corporation YPC, which is a subsidiary of Sinopec, Chinas leading petrochemical company.
BOC purchased existing air separation assets with effect from May 2002 and construction of new air separation capacity is almost complete.
BOCs joint venture will be a supplier to a new BASF and YPC joint venture plant also under construction and scheduled to begin production in 2005.
Additional liquefaction capacity was added to the existing air separation facility during 2003.
These investments give BOC a strategic position as a key supplier in the Nanjing area, which is being developed through foreign investment as a leading centre for chemical production in China.
In the US a new plant began to supply WCI Steel in Ohio in May 2002 and a plant at Midland, North Carolina, began production in June 2002.
The merger of BOC Process Plants operations with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC was completed at the end of September 2002.
EMCs management services extend to steam systems, cold and chilled water systems and wastewater treatment.
Customers include small to medium sized municipalities and industrial customers, many of which are in the food sector.
EMC forms part of the PGS line of business and BOCs strategy is to expand the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a world scale vinyl acetate monomer plant and the worlds largest acetic acid plant.
These require large quantities of oxygen and nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant supplying the Thai Polycarbonate Company for the manufacture of plastic resins began production in 2003.
In October 2003, BOC commissioned a new hydrogen plant supplying Citgos oil refinery at Lemont, Illinois.
The hydrogen is used in the removal of sulphur to produce clean fuels.
In the same month BOC, and its joint venture partners, announced plans to invest over US$100 million in developing three schemes in China, at Taiyuan, Suzhou and in the Pearl River region.
BOC-TISCO, the joint venture between BOC Gases and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation TISCO, will build two new air separation units ASUs with each to supply 1,400 tonnes a day of oxygen to TISCOs plant in Shanxi province in north-central China.
The new ASUs represent an investment of US$82 million and they are scheduled to begin coming on stream after the end of 2005.
This investment is in response to strong demand for stainless steel in China and will support TISCOs vigorous expansion plans.
Through Hong Kong Oxygen, its joint venture company in southern China, BOC has reached an agreement with Guangzhou Iron & Steel GIS for their joint venture company Pearl River Gases PRG to build a further two ASUs, adding around 400 tonnes of production to its current operations.
This new investment is scheduled to come on stream early in 2005, supporting the expansion of steel manufacturing in southern China.
BOCs wholly owned subsidiaries in Suzhou have begun construction of new on-site supply scheme pipelines to meet increasing demand for industrial gases from key customers in Suzhou Industrial Park and the Suzhou New District Industrial Park.
A new hydrogen plant to supply both a Sunoco refinery, and a nearby BP refinery is to be built at Toledo, Ohio.
The hydrogen will be used by both BP and Sunoco in the production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline and diesel fuels.
The complex will be capable of supplying over 120 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen.
BOCs partner for engineering and construction is Linde BOC Process Plants of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
BOC is investing more than US$100 million in the facility, which is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2005.
In China, significant new business was won in the chemical sector with the Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company.
BOC will form a joint venture to invest in existing assets and then add further air separation capacity.
BOCs subsidiary in Thailand is to invest in a venture establishing a 1,300 tonnes-a-day plant to supply TOC Glycol Co. Ltd. TOCGC in Map Ta Phut and to increase merchant capacity in the area.
When completed early in 2006, this will be the largest air separation unit in Thailand.
It will be owned and operated by a joint venture between BOCs Thai subsidiary TIG and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company.
19 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Group profile Industrial and Special Products ISP Gases for cutting and welding, hospitality, laboratory applications and a variety of medical purposes are mainly distributed under pressure in cylinders.
The ISP line of business covers products and services provided to this section of the market together with sales of packaged chemicals and liquefied petroleum gas LPG.
Customers are typically in the fabrication, engineering, automotive, refrigeration, hospitality or medical sectors.
The customer base is therefore broad and varied.
The number of separate customers served by ISP is much greater than the other two lines of business and the quality of service is often the key factor in securing existing or obtaining new customers.
In order to raise service standards at the same time as reducing costs, national customer service centres have been successfully established in all the major markets.
In addition to supplying gases, BOC also supplies a range of associated equipment in many of its major markets.
This includes cutting and welding products and, in some markets, associated safety equipment.
BOC has devoted considerable attention over the last three years to understand the requirements of different types of customer in its major markets and to provide the required service at an appropriate price.
Such customer segmentation programmes have been implemented in the UK, South Africa, Australia, Asia, Latin America and are in progress elsewhere.
The cutting and welding applications are a relatively mature part of the industrial gases business and growth opportunities are principally in other segments of the market such as medical applications, packaged chemicals, hospitality and services.
BOC is pursuing these opportunities by the development of new products, packages and services as well as by marketing initiatives to take advantage of BOCs global capabilities by introducing existing products to new regions.
Electronic commerce has also become an important tool for sustaining and growing sales by making it easier for customers to manage their business with BOC as a supplier.
BOC is a leading supplier of helium and has liquid helium distribution centres, or transfills, in many markets around the world.
With 48 helium transfills in its global network, management believes that this is the largest of its kind.
Helium has a broad range of applications, including welding and the refrigeration of medical scanner magnets, and is vital to the production of optical fibres, semiconductors and special alloys.
It is also used for leak detection, underwater breathing mixtures and lifting.
Business development In April 2002, BOC acquired Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, one of Canadas leading providers of special gases and equipment.
Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited UGP, a leading distributor of liquefied petroleum gas LPG and ammonia in Thailand, was acquired in May 2002.
BOCs associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc NIOI in March 2002 and, following a tender offer, increased its holding to 100 per cent in September 2002.
The transaction was completed in January 2003 following approval by the Polish competition authority.
The business acquired includes a high proportion of ISP sales.
Since 2002, BOC has continued its global roll-out of a light-weight medical cylinder with an integrated valve and regulator for homecare patients and emergency services.
Heliox, a helium and oxygen mixture formulated to ease the respiratory effort associated with airway obstruction, was launched in the UK.
Capacity at BOCs Otis, Kansas, helium plant was expanded in 2002 to match market demands.
In addition, BOC has access to helium produced by other US plants, as well as to product from Poland and Russia.
In 2003 BOC and KRIO, a division of the Polish Oil and Gas Company, entered into a new helium supply agreement.
BOC will purchase for export all of KRIOs helium that is not sold to its domestic customers in Poland.
BOC has been KRIOs sole customer for bulk liquid helium since the original agreement was signed in 1972.
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI systems use liquid helium to cool superconducting magnets.
BOC provides helium as well as a liquid nitrogen filling service to meet MRI operators total requirements.
In 2002, ISP signed a major helium supply scheme with Oxford Magnet Technology in the UK.
BOC continued to invest in refrigerant filling facilities during 2002 and in 2003 new filling facilities were installed in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines.
Each of these was built to a standardised global design.
BOC now supplies refrigerants in 19 countries compared with six countries in 1999.
In June 2003, BOC announced a global alliance with Hudson Technologies to promote technology for cleaning and recycling used refrigerants.
Significant progress in developing web-based customer portals was made in 2002.
