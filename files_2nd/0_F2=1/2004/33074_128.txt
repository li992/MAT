2 The accrued annual pension is calculated on a deferred basis using the Executive Directors service to 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 respectively on the basis that the Executive Directors remain in service until at least age 60 and that the pension payment commences at that time.
It includes all pensions provided from Unilever pension plans.
In the event that an Executive Director leaves service prior to age 60 and the payment of pension commences earlier than age 60, the pension payable would be on a reduced basis.
The Netherlands based Executive Directors arrangements operate on the basis of a justifiable expectation and do not provide a vested deferred entitlement and therefore the gures are on a notional deferred basis.
The Netherlands based Executive Directors leaving before age 55 are not entitled to a pension from the NV arrangement, their entitlement would be to their pension from other Unilever pension plans.
3 The increase in accrued pension during 2004 includes the effect of ination on the accrued pension at 31 December 2003.
4 The transfer values for the Netherlands based and US based Executive Directors' arrangements are calculated on the basis used by the Unilever Netherlands pension plan Progress, as prescribed by the Netherlands Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment.
