Special Business The Notice of Annual General Meeting contains as special business one Special Resolution, one Extraordinary Resolution and one Ordinary Resolution: i Special Resolution Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights This item, set out as Resolution 10 in the Notice of Meeting, seeks to renew the authority granted at the previous Annual General Meeting for the directors to take advantage of Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
Section 89 of the Act requires that an allotment of shares for cash may not be made unless the shares are first offered to existing shareholders on a pre-emptive basis in accordance with the Act.
Section 95 of the Act permits the directors to disapply these pre-emption requirements and accordingly a Special Resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting which, if passed, will have the effect of granting the directors the power, on similar terms to that granted by the Special Resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2004, to allot up to 5 per cent of the present issued ordinary share capital otherwise than in accordance with Section 89 of the Act in addition to any issue by way of rights.
ii Extraordinary Resolution Authority to Purchase Own Shares This item, set out as Resolution 11 in the Notice of Meeting, seeks to renew the authority of the company to make market purchases of up to 29,362,485 ordinary shares 15 per cent of the issued ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 of 5 pence each at a price not exceeding 5 per cent above the average of the mid-market quotation of the ordinary shares in the five business days preceding such purchase at a price not below 5 pence per share.
Purchases will only be made on the London Stock Exchange and only in circumstances where they are, in the opinion of the directors, in the best interests of the company and the Group.
Such purchases will be financed out of distributable profits and will only be made in circumstances which, in the opinion of the directors, should result in an improvement in earnings per share.
Subject to these criteria, your directors propose to continue with the programme of purchasing the companys shares.
Any shares purchased under this arrangement will either be cancelled or held in treasury.

co. uk DIRECTORS REPORT iii Ordinary Resolution Authority to allot shares This item, set out as Resolution 9 in the Notice of Meeting seeks to renew the authority of the directors to allot shares.
Under the provisions of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, the directors may not allot shares unless so authorised.
The Act provides for such authority to be granted either by the company in general meeting, or by the Articles of Association, and in both cases such authority must be renewed at least every five years.
The current authority to allot shares was granted at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 April 2001, and the resolution to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting merely seeks to renew that authority to the extent of authorised but unissued share capital as at the date of the passing of the resolution.

Arriva positively welcomes all types of staff and customers.
Building on the first ever group-wide employee survey in 2003, the Board has confirmed its commitment to diversity.
The Boards objective is to achieve a workforce profile to reflect future demographics and create an environment in which differences are genuinely valued.
A further Arriva-wide employee survey is expected to be conducted during 2005.
The Group continues to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment by disabled persons, having regard to their respective aptitudes and abilities.
The Groups policy includes, where applicable, the continued employment of those who may become disabled during their employment.
The Group has continued its policy of employee involvement, by making information available to employees on a regular basis.
The company has a long history of employee share schemes and we continue to recognise the value and benefits of employee share ownership: a Share Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2004, is being implemented in 2005.
Policy Regarding Payment of Suppliers The Groups policy regarding the payment of suppliers is either to agree terms of payment at the start of business with each supplier or to ensure that the supplier is made aware of the payment terms, and in either case to pay in accordance with its contractual or other legal obligations.
At 31 December 2004 the companys trade creditors outstanding represented approximately 49 days purchases 2003: 42 days.
