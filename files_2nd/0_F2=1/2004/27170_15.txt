Directors Report The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2004. Review of the Business A review of the Companys operations and its prospects is given in the Chairmans Statement on pages 10 and 11 and in the Investment Managers Report on pages 19 to 21.
Principal activity and status The Company is an investment company within the meaning of Part VIII of the Companies Act 1985 and carries on business as an investment trust.
In the opinion of the Directors of the Company, its affairs have been conducted in a manner to satisfy the conditions to enable it to continue to obtain approval as an investment trust under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The Inland Revenue will grant Section 842 status, if requested, provided that the Companys affairs have been conducted in such a manner as to satisfy the conditions of that section.
Inland Revenue approval for such status has been given for the year ended 31 December 2003.
Results and dividends The revenue attributable to equity Shareholders for the year amounted to 13,648,000.
Three interim dividends of 3.45p each were paid on 16 August 2004, 17 November 2004 and 16 February 2005.
The Directors now recommend a final dividend for the year ending 31 December 2004 of 5.95p per Ordinary share payable on 20 May 2005 to holders of Ordinary shares on the register at close of business on 22 April 2005 making a total distribution to Ordinary Shareholders of 14,090,000, as shown in Note 8.
The sum of 442,000 has been deducted from the Companys revenue reserve.
The Directors also recommend: 1 that three interim dividends each of 3.55p per share on the Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in issue on 24 June 2005 be paid on 15 August 2005, 16 November 2005 and 15 February 2006 to the persons who at close of business on 22 July 2005, 21 October 2005 and 20 January 2006 respectively, are the holders of such shares.
2 the distribution to B Ordinary Shareholders by way of capitalisation of reserves of 3.55886 B Ordinary shares created as fully paid for every 100 B Ordinary shares held at close of business on 22 April 2005.
This capitalisation issue is in accordance with the dividend provisions of the Articles of Association of the Company and is equivalent in asset value to the final and interim dividends now recommended on the Ordinary shares but excluding any tax credit thereon.
Subject to the approval of Shareholders, definitive certificates in respect of the capitalisation issue will be posted on 20 May 2005.
Applications will be made to the UK Listing Authority for 39,600 B Ordinary shares of 25p each to be admitted to the Official List and to the London Stock Exchange for admission to trading.
Dealings are expected to commence on 23 May 2005.
6 to approve the above distribution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting, as printed in the Notice of Meeting.
The Net Asset Value per Ordinary and B Ordinary share at 31 December 2004 was 466.7p 2003 424.2p.
Share Repurchases and Issue of shares At the Annual General Meeting held on 29 April 2004, Shareholders approved the renewal of the authority permitting the Company to repurchase its Ordinary shares.
The Directors wish to renew the authority given by Shareholders at the previous Annual General Meeting.
The principal aim of a share buy-back facility is to enhance Shareholder value by acquiring shares at a discount to Net Asset Value, as and when the Directors consider this to be appropriate.
The purchase of shares, when they are trading at a discount to Net Asset Value per share, should result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders.
This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so would result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per share for the remaining Shareholders and if it is in the best interests of Shareholders generally.
Any purchase of shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board.
It is proposed to seek Shareholder authority to renew this facility for another year at the Annual General Meeting.
Under the Listing Rules, the maximum price that may be paid on the exercise of this authority must not exceed 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the shares over the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase.
The minimum price which may be paid is 25p per share.
shares which are purchased under this authority will be cancelled.
28 Murray International Trust PLC It is currently proposed that the purchase of shares by the Company will be made from the realised capital reserve of the Company.
The purchase price will normally be paid out of the cash balances held by the Company from time to time.
The Resolution seeking authority to buy-back shares, will permit the Company to hold shares bought back as Treasury shares rather than cancel them immediately.
The Company would only sell on Treasury shares at a premium to net asset value.
When shares are held in treasury, all voting rights are suspended and no distribution either by way of dividend or by way of a winding up is permitted in respect of Treasury shares.
9 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting will renew the authority to purchase in the market a maximum of 14.99% of shares in issue on 10 March 2005 amounting to 12,965,091 Ordinary shares and 166,796 B Ordinary shares.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means in effect that the authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting or earlier if the authority has been exhausted.
During the year ended 31 December 2004 and from the date of renewal of the authority on 29 April 2004 to 31 December 2004, no share repurchases have taken place.
Issue of shares In terms of the Companies Act 1985 the Act the Directors may not allot unissued shares unless so authorised by the Shareholders.
7 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, if passed, will therefore give the Directors the necessary authority to allot the unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,095,054 equivalent to 4,324,580 Ordinary shares and 55,635 B Ordinary shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued share capital at 10 March 2005, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report.
Such authority will expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months from the date of the passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier.
This means that the authority will have to be renewed at the next Annual General Meeting.
When shares are to be allotted for cash, section 89 1 of the Companies Act provides that existing Shareholders have pre-emption rights and that the new shares must be offered first to such Shareholders in proportion to their existing holding of shares.
However, Shareholders can, by special resolution, authorise the Directors to allot shares otherwise than by a pro rata issue to existing Shareholders.
8 will, if passed, also give the Directors power to allot for cash, equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,095,054 equivalent to 4,324,580 Ordinary shares and 55,635 B Ordinary shares or 5 per cent of the Companys existing issued share capital at 10 March 2005, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report, as if Section 89 1 of the Companies Act does not apply.
This is the same nominal amount of share capital which the Directors are seeking the authority to allot pursuant to Resolution No.
This authority will also expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or after a period of 15 months, whichever is earlier.
This authority will not be used in connection with a rights issue by the Company.
The Directors intend to use the authority given by Resolutions No.
8 to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights only in circumstances where this will be clearly beneficial to Shareholders as a whole.
As such, issues will only be made where shares can be issued at a premium of 2.5 per cent or more to Net Asset Value.
At present, the shares are available under the savings plans operated by the Manager.
In circumstances where the share price of the Company stands at a premium of 2.5 per cent or more to Net Asset Value, it may be advantageous for the Company to allot new shares directly to participants in the savings plans or to other prospective purchasers.
As such issues would only be made at prices greater than Net Asset Value, they would increase the assets underlying each share.
The issue proceeds would be available for investment in line with the Companys investment policy.
No issue of shares will be made which would effectively alter the control of the Company without the prior approval of Shareholders in general meeting.
Share Capital The issued Ordinary share capital at 31 December 2004 and 10 March 2005 amounted to 86,491,605 Ordinary and 1,112,717 B Ordinary shares.
