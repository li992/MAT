In addition, reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates have been used in the preparation of the accounts.

For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the accounts.
Internal control The Board is responsible for the Groups system of internal control and reviews its effectiveness at least annually.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Through the regular meetings of the Board and the schedule of matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised Committees for decision, the Board aims to maintain full and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues.
The Board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority.
Each year, the Board considers and approves a rolling strategic plan and an annual budget.
In addition, there are established procedures and processes for planning and controlling expenditure and the making of investments.
There are also information and reporting systems for monitoring the Groups businesses and their performance.
Risk Committee is a management committee formed by the Chief Executive whose purpose is to review the business of the Group in order to ensure that business risk is considered, assessed and managed as an integral part of the business.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Groups significant risks.
This process was in place for the year ended 31 March 2004 and up to the date of this report.
The process is regularly reviewed by the Board and complies with the internal control guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, issued by the Turnbull Committee.
The process established for the Group includes: Policies core values, Group standards and Group controls together comprising the Groups high level principles and controls, with which all staff are expected to comply: manuals of policies and procedures, applicable to all business units, with procedures for reporting weaknesses and for monitoring corrective action: a code of business conduct, with procedures for reporting compliance therewith: 36 3i Report and accounts 2004 Directors report Processes appointment of experienced and professional staff, both by recruitment and promotion, of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities: a planning framework which incorporates a Board approved rolling strategic plan, with objectives for each business unit: formal business risk reviews performed by management which evaluate the potential financial impact and likelihood of identified risks and possible new risk areas, set control, mitigation and monitoring procedures and review actual occurrences identifying lessons to be learnt: a comprehensive system of financial reporting to the Board, based on an annual budget with monthly reports against actual results, analysis of variances, scrutiny of key performance indicators and regular re-forecasting: regular treasury reports to the Board, which analyse the funding requirements of each class of assets, track the generation and use of capital and the volume of liquidity, measure the Groups exposure to interest and exchange rate movements and record the level of compliance with the Groups funding objectives: a compliance department whose role is to integrate regulatory compliance procedures into the Groups systems: well defined procedures governing the appraisal and approval of investments including detailed investment and divestment approval procedures incorporating appropriate levels of authority and regular post investment reviews: Verification an internal audit department which undertakes periodic examination of business units and processes and recommends improvements in controls to management: the external auditors who are engaged to express an opinion on the annual accounts: an Audit and Compliance Committee which considers significant control matters and receives reports from the internal and external auditors and the regulatory compliance function on a regular basis.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by an internal audit function which operates on an international basis and reports to management and the Audit and Compliance Committee on the Groups operations.
The work of the internal auditors is focused on the areas of greatest risk to the Group determined on the basis of the Groups risk management process.
The external auditors independently and objectively review the approach of management to reporting operating results and financial condition.
In coordination with the internal auditors, they also review and test the system of internal financial control and the information contained in the Report and accounts to the extent necessary for expressing their opinion.
Auditors independence and objectivity Subject to annual appointment by shareholders, auditor performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally reviewed every five years, the next review being scheduled for 2008.
The Audit and Compliance Committee reviewed auditor performance during the year and concluded that Ernst & Young LLPs appointment as the Companys auditor should be continued.
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring the independence and objectivity of the Companys auditors.
It reviews the nature and extent of the services provided by them, the level of their fees and the element comprising non-audit fees.
The Audit and Compliance Committee Chairman is notified of all assignments allocated to Ernst & Young over a set threshold, other than those related to due diligence within the Groups investment process where the team engaged would be independent of the audit team.
Safeguards have been put in place to reduce the likelihood of compromising auditor independence, including the following principles which are applied in respect of services provided by the auditors and other accounting firms and monitored by the Audit and Compliance Committee: services required to be undertaken by the auditors, which include regulatory returns, formalities relating to borrowings, shareholder and other circulars.
This work is normally allocated directly to the auditors: services which it is most efficient for the auditors to provide.
In this case, information relating to the service is largely derived from the Companys audited financial records, for example, corporate tax services.
This work is normally allocated to the auditors subject to consideration of any impact on their independence: services that could be provided by a number of firms including general consultancy work.
All significant consultancy projects are normally put out to tender and work would be allocated to the auditors only if it did not present a potential threat to the independence of the audit team.
Included in this category is due diligence work relating to the investment process.
If this service were to be provided by the auditors, the specific team engaged would be independent of the audit team.
Details of the fees paid to the auditors are disclosed in note 14 to the accounts on page 57.
Ernst & Young LLP In accordance with section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Companys auditors will be put to members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
