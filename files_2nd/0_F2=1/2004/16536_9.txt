Reorganisation of the Group In preparation for Listing, Twin Star, the holding company of the predecessor group, divested a number of subsidiaries and associated undertakings carrying on businesses which were considered to be non-core to the Group.
These interests, together with certain amounts receivable from such interests and from Mr DP Agarwal, were transferred to Twin Star International Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volcan, under an agreement dated 1 December 2003.
Twin Star International Limited is not part of the Group and no transactions have occurred since the date of Listing between the Group and this company.
Until 1 December 2003, Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volcan and had an issued share capital of 1.
On 1 December 2003 the issued share capital of Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited was transferred by Volcan to the Company for a consideration of 1.

The issue of these shares at 3.90 per share less the nominal value of 10 US cents per share resulted in the Company crediting US$863.7 million to its share premium account as at 10 December 2003.
Being a newly incorporated company, the Company had no existing distributable reserves.
In order to create distributable reserves, the Company passed a resolution to reduce the share premium account of the Company by an amount equal to the share premium arising on Listing less an amount of US$70.0 million.
This reduction was sanctioned by the High Court on 10 December 2003 and thus distributable reserves of US$793.7 million were created.

Supplier Payment Policy The Group does not follow any specific external code or standard on payment terms.
Instead, responsibility for determining payment terms is delegated to the individual businesses within the Group which take into account local market and industry practice.
As a Group, the policy for determining payment terms is either to agree terms of payment at the start of a binding contract or to ensure that the supplier is aware of the individual business usual payment terms.
Payment is made in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations, and reflects local market practices.
The Company is a holding company and, as such, has few suppliers.
Trade creditor days of the Company at 31 March 2004 were 14.5 days.
Post-Balance Sheet Events As disclosed in note 34 to the Financial Statements, on 2 April 2004, the Group acquired a 2.4% interest in Sterlite which was acquired from the Sterlite Employees Welfare Trust for an aggregate consideration of US$21.4 million.
After completing this acquisition, the Companys direct and effective interests in Sterlite increased to 62.5% and 68.1%, respectively.
In June 2004, SEBI approved a three-for-ten rights issue by Sterlite.
This has subsequently been amended to a one-for-two rights issue and re-submitted to SEBI for approval.
Completion is expected in the second half of 2004, with expected proceeds of US$440 million, net of all costs.
The Company has fully underwritten the rights issue.
Value of Land Land is carried in the balance sheet at historic cost.
It is not practical to estimate the market value of land and mineral reserves and resources at any one point in time, since the market values depend on commodity prices which fluctuate on a day-to-day basis.
