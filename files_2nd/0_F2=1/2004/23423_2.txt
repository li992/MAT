Overview Electra Background to Recent Changes Since listing in 1976, Electra has specialised in investing in the private equity market and, through the adoption of a flexible investment policy, has achieved returns substantially in excess of the FTSE AllShare Index over the last ten years.
As an investment trust, Electra has a number of advantages over limited partnership funds which invest in private equity.
Between 1976 and 2004 Electra invested over 3,000 million in private equity investments.
Inclusive of a capital injection of 32 million, Electras assets grew from 58 million in February 1976 to 1,145 million by 30 September 1998, the financial year end immediately preceding the hostile takeover bid for Electra in 1999.
This bid failed when shareholders voted in favour of a scheme which involved the controlled realisation of the portfolio over a five year period under which new investment was restricted to existing portfolio companies.
Since the start of the realisation programme in March 1999, Electra has returned 1,093 million to shareholders leaving a residual portfolio valued at 578 million at 30 September 2004.
This compares with the stock market value of Electra of 975 million immediately before the announcement of the takeover bid.
Over the five and a half years to 30 September 2004, 489 million has been invested in portfolio companies and 1,700 million has been realised from the portfolio.
Shareholders approved proposals in June 2001 which retained the emphasis on realising the investment portfolio but made provision for Electra to continue as an investment vehicle.
In June 2004, the Board, with input from its advisers and Electra Partners, reviewed Electras investment strategy and concluded that, in the short term, it should continue unchanged from the investment strategy approved by shareholders in June 2001.
Also in June 2004, the Board announced a Tender Offer of 100 million which was completed in July 2004 and which was followed by on-market share buy-backs completed in August and September 2004 for 48 million in total.
