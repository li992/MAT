NET ASSET VALUE The net asset value of one ordinary share at 31 March 2004, after deducting the proposed dividend of 3.1p per share, was 623.2p.
REVIEW OF BUSINESS The Company specialises in investments which are held with a view to achieving long-term capital growth.
The fixed asset investments were valued at 31 March 2004 at 978.8 million.
An analysis of these investments is contained in note 10 on pages 43 to 46.
The Company holds both listed and unlisted investments, mainly in the USA, the UK, Europe and Japan.
At the present time, the portfolio meets the requirements to enable the shares of the Company to be included as an investment within an Individual Savings Account ISA.
SHARE CAPITAL AND PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES Details of the authorised and issued share capital appear in note 19 on page 50 of the accounts.
No ordinary shares have been issued during the year.
During the year to 31 March 2004 the Company has not purchased any ordinary shares for cancellation.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 2 July 2003, the Company was given power to purchase up to 23,511,540 ordinary shares, which represented 14.99% of the issued share capital as at that date.
This power expires on 30 September 2004.
Share purchases are only made when they enhance the net asset value per share.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Directors Report 15 SHARE CAPITAL AND PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES CONTINUED A resolution, No.
14, will again be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to seek power to purchase up to a maximum of 23,511,540 shares, at a price which is not less than 1 per share and not more than 5% above the average middle-market quotations for the preceding five business days.
This represents 14.99% of the present issued share capital.
If the issued share capital is less at the time of the Annual General Meeting by reason of purchases, the maximum will be 14.99% of that reduced issued capital.
The authority now sought would last until 30 September 2005.
The Directors do not intend to purchase shares at more than their attributable net asset value.
OTHER SPECIAL BUSINESS AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Although the Companys Articles of Association provide that all unissued shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors, Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 requires that the authority of the Directors to allot relevant securities shall be subject to the approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Accordingly, shareholders are being asked at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting as Resolution No.
12 to renew, for a period of one year, the Directors authorisation to allot the Companys unissued shares up to a nominal amount of 52,282,722, which is less than a third of the issued equity share capital of the Company at the date of this report.
The Directors have no present intention of allotting shares pursuant to this authority.
The allotment limit proposed for the current year follows the guidelines of the Association of British Insurers.
The Directors also seek, as Resolution No.
13 at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the renewal of the usual authority to enable them, during the period expiring on the date of the Annual General Meeting in 2005, to allot not more than 5% which would correspond to 7,842,408 shares of the issued shares as at 31 March 2004 for cash other than by way of rights.
It is the intention of the Directors, under such authority, not to allot shares at less than their attributable net asset value.
The Directors are seeking the authority of the Companys shareholders to amend the Articles of Association in two respects.
15 will amend the provisions in the Articles relating to the retirement by rotation of the Directors so that they will correspond with the recommendations of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in July 2003.
All Directors will, if the resolution is passed, be obliged to retire and stand for re-election at intervals of no more than three years.
Non-executive Directors who have held office for nine or more years shall be required to retire and stand for re-election annually.
It should be noted that all non-executive Directors who have held office for nine or more years shall be standing for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, so as to comply with the new Combined Code recommendation at the earliest opportunity.
15, if passed, will also provide scope to comply with more onerous retirement by rotation recommendations, with Directors consent, should any be introduced in future.
16 will be proposed to amend the existing requirements in the Articles of Association that proxy votes for use at general meetings of the Company must be in written form.
If the resolution is passed, this will enable the Company to offer shareholders the choice of voting by written proxy, as at present, or electronically.

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives: RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Directors Report 19 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: and derivative transactions which the Group enters into to manage market risks and currency risks.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
Market Price Risk Market price risk arises from uncertainty about the future value of the Groups investments.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions as the result of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets by taking positions in index futures relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those particular markets or to enable increased exposure when appropriate.
Short-term exposure to movements in exchange rates caused by the buying and selling of investments for future settlement is mitigated through entering into forward contracts.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups total return and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements as a substantial proportion of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting its exposure to particular foreign currencies.
These contracts are used principally for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk when this is deemed appropriate.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are analysed in note 27 on pages 52 to 54.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations and take appropriate action.
PAYMENT OF SUPPLIERS It is the Companys payment policy to obtain the best terms for all business.
The Company agrees the terms on which business will take place with its suppliers, and it is the Companys policy to abide by such terms.
The Company had no trade creditors at the year end.
