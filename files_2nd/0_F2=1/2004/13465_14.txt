Rio Tinto share Rio Tinto share 000 tonnes 000 tonnes PRODUCTION PRODUCTION Rio Tinto Aluminium Rio Tinto Aluminium is a major supplier of bauxite, alumina and primary aluminium to world markets.
Rio Tinto Aluminium has a large, wholly owned bauxite mine on Cape York Peninsula, Queensland.
A US$150 million mine expansion was completed on time to supply the bauxite requirements of the Comalco Alumina Refinery.
Approximately 90 per cent of the bauxite from Weipa is shipped to alumina refineries at Gladstone, Queensland and Sardinia, Italy.
Construction of the first stage of the wholly owned Comalco Alumina Refinery at Gladstone in Queensland was completed in late 2004, ahead of schedule and close to the budget of US$750 million.
Operations have commenced and first shipments were made in November 2004, three months ahead of schedule.
The refinery is expected to produce 1.4 million tonnes of alumina annually, with full capacity due to be reached by the end of 2006.
There is potential for 00 01 02 04 capacity to be increased to over four million tonnes per year in two 00 01 02 03 04 03 additional stages and a small team is working on a feasibility study for Stage Two.
The majority of the refinerys Stage One output will go into Rio Tinto Aluminium Rio Tinto Aluminium smelters.
The balance will be placed in the traded Earnings contribution alumina market.
The refinery enables Rio Tinto Aluminium to add further US$m value to the Weipa bauxite deposit and strengthen both Rio Tinto Aluminiums and Australias positions in the world alumina market.
In 2004, Comalco sold its four per cent interest in the Bok bauxite deposit in West Africa to other shareholders in the joint venture for US$12 million.
The gain of US$4 million has been excluded from adjusted earnings.
In 2003, Comalco signed a long term alumina supply agreement with Norsk Hydro, to supply 300,000 tonnes of alumina in 2005 and then 500,000 tonnes of alumina per year for more than 20 years.
This Earnings attributable agreement underpins the investment in the Comalco Alumina Refinery.
to Comalcos minority interests Rio Tinto Aluminiums primary aluminium is produced by smelters at Boyne Island at Gladstone 59.4 per cent, Bell Bay 100 per cent in Earnings attributable to Rio Tinto Tasmania, Tiwai Point 79.4 per cent in New Zealand and Anglesey Aluminium 51 per cent in Wales, UK.
Note: the last of the Comalco minority interests was purchased in 2000, and 2004 excludes an exceptional item.

Bauxite production at Weipa was 12.6 million tonnes, six per cent higher than in 2003.
Weipa bauxite shipments increased eight per cent, to 12.3 million tonnes, compared with 2003 levels.
QAL production increased by one per cent compared to 2003, despite an interruption to the refinerys power supply.
This interruption reduced production by approximately 85,000 tonnes 33,000 tonnes Rio Tinto share but otherwise QAL enjoyed strong production for the balance of the year.
Eurallumina production increased four per cent over 2003 levels.
Comalco Alumina Refinery produced 175,000 tonnes beginning in October with first shipments occurring in November, three months ahead of schedule.
Rio Tinto Aluminiums share of aluminium production from its four smelters at 837,000 tonnes was 20,000 tonnes above 2003 production.
Attributable metal shipments for 2004 were 841,000 tonnes, an increase of 21,000 tonnes, and went to similar destinations as in 2003, primarily Japan, Australia, Europe and Korea.
Production at Anglesey increased by two per cent, Boyne Island increased by four per cent, Tiwai Point increased by five per cent.
The Bell Bay smelter suffered equipment failure in June in the electrical switchyard, resulting in a three per cent decrease in production.
The equipment has been replaced and production returned to normal levels.
ALUMINIUM GROUP PROJECTS Weipa mine expansion Rio Tinto: 100 per cent The US$150 million mine expansion at Weipa in 2004 is expected to increase capacity to 16.5 million tonnes of bauxite per year.
The mining upgrade relates to a move to simultaneous mining at Weipas Andoom and East Weipa mines and involves a change in ore characteristic fine ore to that previously being mined.
The majority of the expenditure for the project was on a 9.5 million tonne beneficiation plant to allow mining of lower grade fine ores.
The next activity will be the construction of a new US$42 million power station for the Weipa mining operations and surrounding communities.
