In preparing these financial statements, the directors, following discussions with the auditors, consider that they have: selected suitable accounting policies and then applied them consistently: made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: followed applicable accounting standards.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
