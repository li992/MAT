4 Comparison of the Companys performance is made with the benchmark as stated.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not follow or track this index and therefore there may be a degree of diversity of performance from the index stated.
5 Actual gearing means investments expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
This calculation excludes the Companys holdings in liquidity funds which are held as an alternative to cash.
6 Management fees and all other operating expenses including tax relief, where allowable, but excluding interest payments expressed as a percentage of average net assets over the year.
