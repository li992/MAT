The group has committed bank facilities of 280 million.

Foreign Currency Risk Johnson Mattheys operations are global in nature with the majority of the groups operating profits earned outside the UK.
The group has operations in 34 countries with the largest single investment being in the USA.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk, the group finances most of its US investment by US dollar borrowings.
Although most of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing US dollars, some is achieved by using currency swaps to reduce costs and credit exposure.
The group also uses local currency borrowings to fund its operations in other countries see page 59.
The group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
Currency options are occasionally used to hedge foreign exchange exposures, usually when the forecast receipt or payment amounts are uncertain.
Details of the contracts outstanding on 31st March 2004 are shown on page 61.
