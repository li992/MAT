In the year to 30 September 2004, Electra's net asset value per share increased from 760p per share to 913p per share, an increase of 20.2%.
This strong performance resulted primarily from an active realisation programme leading to a high level of realised gains.

New investments in the year amounted to 48 million compared to 39 million in the previous year.
This amount excludes 165 million in floating rate notes which were purchased during the year to facilitate currency hedging and other treasury operations.
The level of new investment continued to be restricted by the investment strategy currently in place.
The year was highly successful in terms of realisations from the portfolio.

Current Operations and Outlook The year has seen a significant change in Electras portfolio and financial position.
Cash generated from realisations from the investment portfolio was utilised to repay debt, provide funding for a Tender Offer of 100 million and provide funding for 48 million of further on-market share buy-backs.
At the end of the year, Electras investment portfolio contained a significant proportion of larger, mature investments, a number of smaller investments with turnaround potential and several new investments with good upside potential.
While realisations in the year ahead will not match the levels of the 2004 financial year, we anticipate that realisations will continue to occur at a reasonable level provided that market conditions continue to be favourable.
However the timing of future sales may become less predictable as the portfolio reduces in size and an increasing proportion of the portfolio comprises longer term assets.
Meanwhile, good opportunities remain to add value to existing portfolio companies and to add new investments to the portfolio as cash flow becomes available.
