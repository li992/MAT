qxd 13 3 05 12:13 pm Page 33 Directors pensions The pension arrangements for the executive directors, all of whom are now members of the Centrica Management Pension Scheme, are shown below.
As reported last year, all executive directors were offered and all accepted the opportunity to join the Centrica Management Pension Scheme at 6 April 2004, and transferred in their crystallised benefits previously accrued in the Centrica Pension Scheme.
This change brings the executive directors into line with the rest of the companys senior management population.
As reported last year, individual accrual rates in respect of past and future service were increased to take account of the change in normal retirement age from age 65 in the previous scheme to age 62.
The Centrica Management Pension Scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue-approved, final-salary, occupational pension scheme.
It has the following main features: normal retirement at age 62: right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service at companys request after age 55: life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary on death in service, and spouses and childrens pensions on death: members contributions payable at the rate of 6% p. a. of pensionable earnings an increase of 2% on the Centrica Pension Scheme : pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health: pensions in payment and in deferment to increase in line with RPI a maximum of 6% applies to pension accrued after 6 April 2004 : and no discretionary practices taken into account in calculating transfer values.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits and the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme provides benefits on the salary in excess of the earnings cap to the level that would otherwise have been paid by the approved scheme.
The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the approved portion of members benefits.
No individual will receive benefits from the company, which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere, exceed two thirds of their final pensionable salary.
This scheme is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain company assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the companys balance sheet.
During 2005, the company will be reviewing its pension policy as a result of the 2004 Pensions Act, the 2004 Finance Act and the results of the triennial valuation of its schemes during 2004.

iii To allow a meaningful comparison in the increase in the transfer values from 2003 to 2004, notional transfer values have been calculated.
The notional transfer values have been calculated using the actual accrued pensions as at 31 December 2003, but based on the Centrica Management Pension Scheme transfer calculation basis, with reference to market conditions as at 31 December 2003.
The notional transfer values at 31 December 2003 were 248,500, 740,600, 4,229,200, and 2,032,800 for Phil Bentley, Mark Clare, Sir Roy Gardner, and Roger Wood respectively.
The differences in the notional transfer value for 2003 and the actual value for 2004 less member contributions were 344,012, 264,812, 1,893,812 and 1,023,737 for Phil Bentley, Mark Clare, Sir Roy Gardner, and Roger Wood respectively.
iv Member contributions paid in the year were restricted to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings cap.
v The rate of inflation used was 3.1%, the annual rate to 30 September 2004, the date used for pension increases under the scheme.
The actual transfer value of the increase in accrued pension at 31 December 2004 excludes inflation.
vi Phil Bentley transferred in an amount of 208,695 in May 2004 from a previous employers pension arrangement to purchase additional scheme service, which is reflected in his accrued pension and transfer value.
The transfer value allows for the valuefor-money check that would be carried out in respect of the transferred-in benefits had he left service at 31 December 2004. vii Roger Wood stepped down from the company on 30 September 2004 aged 62 years and 2 months.
Under the rules of the Centrica Management Pension Scheme and Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme he receives an unreduced pension.
viii The pension accrual rates applicable in the new arrangement for Phil Bentley, Mark Clare, Sir Roy Gardner and Roger Wood were, respectively, 2.65%, 2.46%, 4.11% and 4.54% of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service.
