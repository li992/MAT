Please note that the time period in table 2 differs to that in table 1.
Statutory reports Geest PLC 31 Sixth cycle: 2002 to 2005 four years : seventh cycle: 2003 to 2006 four years : eighth cycle: 2004 to 2007 four years The total annual value of each award at date of award is 100% of salary for executive Directors and 30% of salary for senior executives 50% of salary for Management Board members from cycle 8.
The award consists of shares only for senior executives although executive Directors continue to receive cash and shares.
The maximum number of shares that could be released to executive Directors under awards made in 2002, 2003 and 2004 is set out in tables 14, 15, and 16, on pages 37 and 38.
Due to the Company being in a prohibited period in January 2005, during which no share awards may be made to executive Directors and senior managers, LTIP awards have not yet been made in 2005.
However, awards have been approved by the Committee and will be made in accordance with policy as soon as the Company is able, should the Bakkavr bid not proceed.
Should the maximum award be released, all of the shares and in the case of executive Directors, cash would be released in one tranche in the March following the end of the performance period.

Statutory reports Geest PLC 35 iii Pension entitlement for executive Directors Executive Directors are entitled to join the Geest Final Pay scheme or the Executive Stakeholder Scheme.
The Final Pay scheme has a members contribution rate of 6.25% of pensionable salary.
For executive Directors it provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on retirement at age 60, subject to completion of at least 20 years pensionable service.
1 th For less than 20 years pensionable service, pension rights are accrued at the rate of 30 of basic salary per annum.
In both cases Inland Revenue limits are applied.
The scheme also provides life assurance and pensions for dependants of members on their death in service or following retirement.
Directors who joined the scheme after May 1989 are subject to the earnings cap, so the Company provides these members with a cash supplement for the part of their salary which exceeds the cap.
A review is currently under way to determine an appropriate strategy for executive pension provision from April 2006 when the simplication provisions of the Finance Act 2004 are introduced.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
