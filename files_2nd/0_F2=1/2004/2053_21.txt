BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 ANNUAL DIVIDENDS The table below sets out the amounts, on a UK GAAP basis, of interim, final and total dividends paid in respect of each of the years in the five years ended 31 December 2004 in Sterling per ordinary share.
These amounts are also shown translated, solely for convenience with the associated UK tax credit included, but after deduction of withholding tax, into US$ per ADS each representing five ordinary shares at the Noon Buying Rate on each of the respective payment dates for such interim and final dividends.
ADR holders will be entitled to receive the US$ equivalent of 0.104 per ADS on 20 May 2005.
The Company is not subject to any laws or agreements that materially restrict its ability to pay dividends from distributable reserves other than those disclosed in note 31, page 108.
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 2.08p, bringing the total for the year to 3.81p.
Future dividends will be dependent on the cash flow, earnings and financial condition of the Company and other factors.
The Noon Buying Rate on 1 March 2005 was $1.9206 per 1.00.
Dividends are paid by the Company in Sterling and exchange rate fluctuations will affect the US$ amounts received by ADR holders on conversion by JPMorgan Chase Bank as depository of such cash dividends paid.
Moreover, fluctuations in the Sterling US$ exchange rate will affect the US$ equivalent of the Sterling price of the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to affect the market price of the ADSs in the USA.
