Demand for iron ore continued to be extremely strong across the product range throughout 2004.
In addition to strong demand from China where iron ore imports rose 40 per cent compared to 2003, the Japanese steel industry operated near capacity and crude steel production in Korea and Taiwan was at record levels.
Reflecting the strength of the market, 18.6 per cent price increases were achieved for fiscal year 2004 for both lump and fines following the nine per cent increases agreed to in 2003.
In June, new long term agreements with leading Chinese steel mills for the sale of an incremental 40 million tonnes per annum of iron ore were announced.
These agreements, together with supply arrangements reached with Nippon Steel and the Shanghai Baosteel Group earlier in the year, underpin the current phase of Rio Tintos expansion of port, rail and mine capacity that is on schedule for completion at the end of 2005.
