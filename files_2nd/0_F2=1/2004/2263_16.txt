In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors also have general responsibility for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
