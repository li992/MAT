This result was achieved despite the impact of more stringent identification rules imposed by the EU for casino guests, a huge increase in the number of fixed odds betting terminals FOBTs in betting shops offering roulette on the high street, and additional competition.
The effect of these developments was most noticeable in the first half but had lessened by the second half when the business enjoyed double digit growth in turnover and operating profit.
However, whilst the Park Tower had an outstanding year following its refurbishment in 2003, an adverse movement in bad debts at the Clermont meant that, combined, profits were only up 12%.
London other: the Groups three mid-market London casinos saw turnover up by 5% and operating profit up 14%.
After a challenging first six months, the Victoria, the Connoisseur and the Gloucester all enjoyed a much more prosperous second half: turnover was up 10% and operating profit was up 30%.
This strong performance was driven by a 9% increase in admissions and an improved win percentage.
The Rank Group Plc 29 Provincial: an unusually weak performance at the interim stage was mitigated by a substantial improvement in performance during the second half of the year.
The impact in the first half of the new EU identication rules and increased numbers of FOBTs was compounded by a number of new competitor openings in towns and cities where Grosvenor operates a casino.
Taken together, these factors affected first half admissions down 6%, handle down 8% and operating profit down 16%.
In contrast, the second half saw like-for-like admissions i. e. excluding the two new casinos that opened in Stoke-on-Trent and Bolton up by 20%, handle up 8% and operating profit up 19%.
The two UK Hard Rock casinos made further progress in 2004.
London is now profitable and the two casinos taken together broke even during the second half and delivered good growth in handle per head, up 15%, and also attendance, up 6%.
This bodes well for the future prospects for the brand within the Grosvenor portfolio.
The introduction of live entertainment at the London casino for the first time has been well received and future events are being planned.
In Belgium, changes in the legislation allowing the introduction of slot machines into casinos has had a positive impact on trading.
Total revenues were up by 29% and operating profit was up to 1.7m 2003 0.3m.

The new products more than compensated for a decline in internet and telebet stakes, where a reduction in the number of high-roller players has improved the quality of earnings, resulting in gross win margins above last year.
Overall, gross win increased by 11% to 25.6m.
Reported operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased to 2.9m 2003 1.9m.

Reported turnover was 2.0m below 2003 after an adverse currency impact of 21.0m.
In constant currency, turnover was up by 8%.
A much improved performance in the owned cafes, combined with a first time contribution from the two Seminole hotel casinos, resulted in operating profit up 20% to 27.8m 2003 23.1m.
This was achieved despite the impact of adverse currency movements which reduced overall operating profit before exceptional items by 2.0m compared with 2003.

Overall food and beverage sales were up 3.4% and merchandise sales were down 5.0%.
In the 8 weeks to 20 February 2005 total like-for-like sales were up 2.2%.
Despite the impact of adverse currency movements, profit from owned cafes was up 5%, reecting tighter cost controls and the contribution from new units.
The improvement in profitability was particularly notable in the second half of the year and reects the results of a detailed review and reassessment of cafe performance with an improved focus on margin management.
Operating profit generated from cafe franchise and other income was down 7% to 5.4m, although in constant currency this was up by 6%.
Hotel and gaming franchise income contributed 9.9m in 2004 2003 5.2m, reflecting another strong performance by the Orlando hotel, dividends from the Groups interest in the Universal Rank Hotel Partnership in Orlando, and fees relating to the hotel joint venture with Sol Meli.
In addition, gaming franchise income benefited from the combined fees from the two Seminole hotel casinos that opened during the year.
Both properties are performing well and in line with expectations.
Territory fees included Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Canary Islands and Gothenburg.
During the year new owned cafes opened in Bristol, Louisville, Destin FL and at Foxwoods.
The cafe in Hollywood FL was also relocated during the year within the new Seminole hotel casino.
Eight new franchised cafes opened in 2004: Catania Italy, Buenos Aires, Dublin, Panama, Athens, Hurghada Egypt, Kuwait and Gothenburg.

This reflects the loss of the Universal and Fox International contracts in 2003 and a reduction in the number of major titles produced by certain studio customers.
After taking account of adverse currency movements of 18.8m, the processing and distribution business experienced a 14% reduction in turnover to 315.6m.
With Deluxe Film processing 31 major titles in 2003, 2004 had just 18 such titles including Spider-man 2, The Day After Tomorrow and I, Robot.
Management believes that the lower number of major titles seen in 2004 was temporary in nature and with a number of major titles scheduled for this year, including XXX2, Son of the Mask and Fantastic Four, it is expected that the trends in footage will return to a more normalised pattern of growth.
Operating profit was 49.9m, with currency movements having reduced the reported figure by 4.2m.
Having extended two film contracts during 2004, all of Deluxe Films contracts are secure until at least the end of 2007, with 77% of 2004 contracted volume secure until at least 2008.
The weighted average contract life as at 31 December 2004 was 53 months.
The Rank Group Plc 31 Creative services Following the acquisition in August 2004 of the 80% of EFILM not already owned and the integration of the digital services businesses, Deluxe Film is now able to offer an end-to-end solution to its studio customers, covering a number of key post-production and pre-DVD mastering services.
In 2004, the creative services business increased turnover by 56% to 51.0m and operating profit by 40% to 10.5m.
The results for 2004 only reflect a part year contribution from both DVCC and Softitler, which were acquired during 2004.
Underlying growth in operating profit, after adjusting for acquisitions, was 24%.

While volumes in DVD manufacturing were up by 43%, reecting a full years contribution from Disctronics, which was acquired during the second half of 2003, margins fell as a result of the loss of a major contract and pricing pressures.
While the loss of a major DVD contract, announced in May 2004, had a modest impact on operating financial performance during the year, in the absence of any major contract wins, operating margins and profits will be much lower in 2005.
The continued growth in demand for DVD and the addition of a major new contract were key factors behind the growth in revenues and volume for the distribution business.
Total volumes increased by 24% to 649m units 2003 523m units and revenues increased by 17% to 125.4m 2003 106.8m.
However, increased competitive pressures and larger than expected set-up costs relating to a new customer meant that operating profit fell to 2.2m 2003 11.5m.
